# Evaluation
The evaluation.ipynb notebook is designed to evaluate multiple models using different metrics. It aims to identify the best-performing model based on specific criteria

## Table of Contents

# Results
This is a table with the results of the best performing models for each of the evaluation metrics

List of evaluated models:
- withoutemotion_single
- withoutemotion_whole
- withemotion
- withcontext
- gpt_withoutemotion
- gpt_blocksize_256

# Explanation
## AVG BLEU: average of BLEU-1, -2, -3, -4

BLEU : Bilingual Evaluation Understudy focuses on n-gram overlap which works well for machine translation tasks but poorly captures the empathy of a response

It does not account for long-range dependencies (sequence context)

Doesn't evaluate if the sequence as a whole makes sense and if it is emotionally aligned with the input

BLEU does not require a language model because directly compares n-grams (word sequences) between the generated output and reference sentences to assess similarity. It doesnâ€™t rely on the probability distribution of words but rather on the overlap of word sequences.


**Example:**
```
Reference 1: I feel very sad today
Model Output: I feel very happy today
BLEU Score: 0.29
```

## Perplexity 
It quantifies the model's "surprise" ðŸ˜® when encountering new data. Calculates the probability of a sentence under a specific language model.

Values range from 0-1. Lower surprise indicates better prediction accuracy.

Model-Dependent: Different language models may assign different probabilities to the same sentence, resulting in different perplexity scores.

Problem: A model might display low perplexity while maintaining a high error rate, indicating overconfidence in incorrect predictions

**Example**
```
Reference 1: I feel very sad today
Model Output 1: I feel very happy today
BERTScore Precisiion: 0.9777
BERTScore Recall: 0.9777
BERTScore F1: 0.977
```

## BERTScore
Another evaluation metrics possibility
Uses contextual embeddings from BERT to measure the semantic similarity between the generated response and the reference.

More robust for open-domain tasks and captures semantic and contextual alignment.

BERTScore compares outputs like BLEU, but it uses a pre-trained modelâ€™s embeddings (e.g. BERT or RoBERTa) to perform the comparison. It does not evaluate the modelâ€™s performance internally (as perplexity does).

```

Reference 1: I feel very sad today

## GLUE
GLUE, also known as General Language Understanding Evaluation, is an evaluation benchmark designed to measure the performance of language understanding models in a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

GLUE has different possible tasks. For the purpose of our project maybe this one is the most interesting: SST-2 (Sentiment Analysis). Stanford Sentiment Treebank 2. Sentiment classification (positive or negative) of sentences.

Compares model-generated sentiments against reference sentiments for a dataset
