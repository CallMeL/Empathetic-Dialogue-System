<bot> <bot> I remember going to see the fireworks with my best friend. It was the first time we ever spent time alone together. Although there was a lot of people, we felt like the only people in the world. <endOfText>
<human> Was this a friend you were in love with, or just a best friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This was a best friend. I miss her. <endOfText>
<human> Where has she gone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We no longer talk. <endOfText>
<human> Oh was this something that happened because of an argument? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi how are you doing today <endOfText>
<human> doing good.. how about you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on my wife. <endOfText>
<human> And thats something you should never do, good on you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> And thats something you should never do, good on you. <endOfText>
<human> Yea it hasn't been easy but I am proud I haven't <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Job interviews always make me sweat bullets, makes me uncomfortable in general to be looked at under a microscope like that. <endOfText>
<human> Don't be nervous. Just be prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like getting prepared and then having a curve ball thrown at you throws you off. <endOfText>
<human> Yes but if you stay calm it will be ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, this year, I was the first over 300 students at my enginering school <endOfText>
<human> Sounds great! So what's your major? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job last year and got really angry. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Did it happen out of the blue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During christmas a few years ago, I did not get any presents. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that must be terrible, I cannot imagine, I lvoe christmas <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker is allowed to work remotely, but I am not... <endOfText>
<human> I work remotely, I wish that you could do something like that as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I went to a park and I set on a bench. I didn't notice that my wallet felt. A man came to me from behind giving me back my wallet. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a sweet man, I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats a sweet man, I hope you acknowledged his kind gesture. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I did. I was so grateful because I have a lot of money in my wallet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People get rejected all the time but it shouldn't be an excuse to let it dissuade you from reaching your goals. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got rejected from a place I wanted to work, not once but three times <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. I hope you find a better opportunity. Did you know why they rejected you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to board my entire house when the hurricane was coming. <endOfText>
<human> WOW! Did it do any damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once when I was in preschool, my pants fell down in front of the whole class, I was so embarassed <endOfText>
<human> haha yeah that would be very bad ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never thought things would go like this. <endOfText>
<human> What happened for you to feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I have a co work always asking me questions about how to use her mobile. It is almost always the same questions. <endOfText>
<human> It must be so frustrating to have to answer the same thing over and over. Is she older? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked on my truck all weekend. Spent $215 on parts and a special tool. Still did not fix the miss in the engine. <endOfText>
<human> What is the problem with the engine? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found myself divorced a few years ago, and for the first time in my life, I was living alone. <endOfText>
<human> I felt sad and depressed due to my insecurities and felt rejected from society <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt proud when I had accomplished a dream that I wanted to do for a long time. It was absailing!! <endOfText>
<human> I'm not familiar with abseiling, but I'm glad that you felt good about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello <endOfText>
<human> Hello! I am in such a good mood since I got my new home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Funny - we just built a house where we used to go camping when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I have a ton of backyard space that we have plans for. Camping would be a fun one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's wonderful. Do you have any plans to have a fire? <endOfText>
<human> I want to look in to getting a nice fire pit for the house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Planning out my new home has turned out to be a blast! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of house are you building?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What kind of house are you building? <endOfText>
<human> I just moved in so it is already built. Just working on planning out decorating and appliances and such. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds great. What are you most excited for? <endOfText>
<human> I think I am most excited for all the space I have. I can have friends over and not feel cramped. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never took a drink before and my friends were all over me to take a drink <endOfText>
<human> Why did you feel guilty for taking a drink? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I did to my mum and dad...When I started vomiting I mess my dress and mum knew. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea I can understand that then... Well I am sure you learned your lesson, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was only married for 4 weeks when I learned my husband was having an affair and ongoing after the wedding. I got him back by sleeping with a close family friend. I felt guilty and ashamed because it was out of character. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah that sounds really sad. I am sorry for what you went through. <endOfText>
<human> Well I choose to stay and work it out, but I never told him. It has been 3 years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah maybe that was a good decision that you made. <endOfText>
<human> Well I thought I would be feel better but because I am not the cheating kind, I still feel guilty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was working my first job, my parents picked me up in my new car, I was very surprised, i thought I was gonna have to buy my own car <endOfText>
<human> wow, that was so awesome of them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm nearing 40 and I find myself thinking a lot about my teen years and early twenties. The friends I had then and the fun we had. <endOfText>
<human> That is where I am still at, I am scared I will have regrets when I get older <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A year ago I spent a lot of time doing research for an article. Then a top journal accepted it for publication. <endOfText>
<human> what was the topic <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any irritating coworkers? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I think that everyone does! What about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I broke a statuette offered by grandmother to my sister. It was a very important object for my sister. <endOfText>
<human> Is it not better you replace it with same type of statuette,at a grocery store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not tolerate the waiters insensitivity,that's poor service indeed! <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left his house, filled up with his food and disgust. I left his fridge completely empty and feel guilth <endOfText>
<human> That would be hard to do and take courage.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be hard to do and take courage. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks man, at the heat of the moment I ate due to my flashbacks I was traumised. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi I was recently on vacation and frightened half to death. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, my, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i was younger, my mother would always take away my PC because I would always play video games on them. <endOfText>
<human> I was the same way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friend didn't keep this promise he made to me. I was so angry to him. <endOfText>
<human> What promise didn't he keep? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There were times where I was being seduced by a coworker of mine as a married man. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Did he have kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am an English Tutor for Chinese students, when they struggle with a topic, I always take extra time to help them along and make sure they understand <endOfText>
<human> That is very inspiring, I'm glad you take the extra time. Do you like doing what you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had a pet that you had to put down? I was so heartbroken when my dog of 16 years had to be put down. this was years ago but it still makes me sad to this day. <endOfText>
<human> That is heartbreaking, it's always helped me to remember that no matter what happens, you have your memories with them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drove to Dairy Queen but it was closed. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  That must have been frustrating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I had a flat tire and my dad came to help me fix it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Glad your dad was able to help. How did it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid's birthday are coming up again. It always makes me remember them as babies. <endOfText>
<human> Awe how sweet, I bet those are good memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Onnce I had to take care of my cousin who had an ailing stomach <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know what caused it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have a new manager at work and it isnt going well. <endOfText>
<human> what is your job position? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do sales work, but he always lies to us and takes our bonus money. <endOfText>
<human> That's very bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You are never going to believe what I did <endOfText>
<human> What did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did you do? <endOfText>
<human> Well, I normally do not feel comfortable lending things to my friends, but recently I mustered up the trust to loan my friend my vehicle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went shopping yesterday and bought a $2000 bag. My husband is going to kill me.. <endOfText>
<human> Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha my girlfriend does the same thing.  Check comes in and she is so happy to have money for the next two weeks, then goes and spends it all on clothing and accessories. <endOfText>
<human> All women have the same problem. It is a guilty pleasure.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate to be tired and see a store crowded with customers and only one or two checkouts open. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it's really frustrating when they won't have more eople on. <endOfText>
<human> Especially when it's a time of day that they know will be crowded and busy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Exactly. Hopefully more places will get self-checkout so we can get through the line faster. <endOfText>
<human> I don't mind those sometimes, sometimes I prefer they do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a person who had to do twice the amount of work that they usually do. Sounded like they need to fire whoever didn't do their job <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, or at least do something to correct that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe there should be a training day where they do back over everything, <endOfText>
<human> or hire more people maybe also <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So our new manager has changed our bonus structure causing us to never hit bonus.. <endOfText>
<human> And then what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its frustrating when I go from 24 an hour to 10 an hour because of his lies. <endOfText>
<human> I understand, that must suck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a chance to make some money, but my phone screwed up <endOfText>
<human> Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats terrible... have you gotten a new phone yet? <endOfText>
<human> yes i did, but i still can not get that money <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year I was so excited to be moving. <endOfText>
<human> oh well, where did you move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i bumped into a car while reversing, i had to wait long to talk to owner of the other car <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible. Sorry you had to deal with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was having a bad day the other day but my spouse went and surprised me with my favorite food. <endOfText>
<human> whats your favorite food? that was very nice of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it was rather sweet of them... i love anything asian! <endOfText>
<human> oh nice, im afraid the most asian food that i like is fortune cookies <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just got back from vacation and our sleep times are off. It is really messing with me. <endOfText>
<human> That will mess you up for a few days. The only thing I don't like about going away. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like getting things done in the yard,but I feel so dirty afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> I only like yard work with the kids. They do most of the work and we have fun in the dirt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day I had a crazy long day and got home to find all of my chocolate was gone! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! I would have been so upset! Nothing is better than chocolates on a bad day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know right! ..., but atleast I had some amaretto in the fridge.. lol <endOfText>
<human> That's definitely better than nothing. I hope your days have been better since! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter, Brooklyn, has finally overcame her fear of water and learned to swim! It makes me so happy to see her loving the water. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so special! What a beautiful moment.. How old is she?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats so special! What a beautiful moment.. How old is she? <endOfText>
<human> She is 4. She normally is completely fearless, compared to my son who is afraid of everything. Haha! So I love that she has worked so hard to overcome this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is 1.5 years old - shes just been introduced to the water.. its always so special when our babies have their "first" moments. Congrats mama! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you, and same to you! I hope you enjoy many happy swimming days with your little princess.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I am home from work and Marks car was outside. I went in and him and Liz were kissing on the couch. <endOfText>
<human> This is terrible. So sad to hear that. What did you do then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made them both leave but me and Liz are breaking up. <endOfText>
<human> Did she already move out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you go outside and see if anyone was hurt? <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean? I don't know what you are talking about. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So after I left the club last night I noticed the Taxi had old throw up in it still. <endOfText>
<human> I would have gotten out right then I believe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My marriage give me hopefulness about the life. exactly I want to say is may not it's marriage actually it's my wife given me the hope about the life. <endOfText>
<human> Wao, that sound like a great strong realtionship you have with her, so glad to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! you're right. We should learn from kids. <endOfText>
<human> When i see them, i believe thiw world in which we live fill with envy and hate can be rewed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day when I was cleaning I came across an old keychain my dad gave me when I was younger, it was nice to see. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good that you found the keychain <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it meant a lot to me - almost like a sign! <endOfText>
<human> that's very good! Always nice to find those old lost items.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My handyman keeps telling me he's coming by to fix my leaky sink, but he never shows up when he says he will, ugh. <endOfText>
<human> That is seriously the worst... waiting around all day wondering whats going on! Have you tried calling him today?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is seriously the worst... waiting around all day wondering whats going on! Have you tried calling him today? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, and it goes to his answering machine every time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co worker keeps getting told how great of a job he is doing and I know hes doing wrong to get all the sales. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I am sure he will get caught eventually though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was amazing sitting on the stage in that hug auditorium. <endOfText>
<human> What event was taking place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am satisfied to have a good vacation <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah what are you doing for your vacation? <endOfText>
<human> Nothing special. I just travel to my familly. It has been almost a year that I didn't see them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day my daughter went potty for the first time on her own! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. It is sweet to see them grow and learn. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Shes 18 months old, it really is amazing to see them develop. If only people clapped for us when we used the bathroom... ha ha <endOfText>
<human> Funny one ha ha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day after dinner my daughter took her trash to the trash on her own. I love watching her develop! <endOfText>
<human> It is so sweet. Is she able to talk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am angry against a friend that suppose to help me. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks... what was he or she supposed to help you with? <endOfText>
<human> I wanted to wall mount my TV but my friend didn't come and turned off his cell phone. I was always helping him for anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I traveled a few months ago and didnt realize how much planning is involved! Wow it was a lot to get ready for... <endOfText>
<human> Traveling is hard work. Where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Peru to visit my family. I try to go every year. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I have never neen that far! I have been to the Caribbean though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a small circle of friends. They are like my family. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, friends really can be the best. How long have you known them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats awesome, friends really can be the best. How long have you known them? <endOfText>
<human> Around ten years. I let my friends borrow my debit card the other day. A stranger wouldve wiped me out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im glad you have such good friends in your life, it makes life easier. <endOfText>
<human> Yep. Trust them with my life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I got a bonus from work, which was amazing because i have recently got behind in bills. <endOfText>
<human> That is really cool! Did they tell you why they were giving you the bonus? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasnt expecting it, but basically because my stats were above <endOfText>
<human> Well at least you get something to look forward too at work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid my neighbors are causing snakes to come over my way. <endOfText>
<human> What are they doing to cause you to think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today is my birthday! I am 34! <endOfText>
<human> Happy Birthday!!!! What are you going to do for it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Happy Birthday!!!! What are you going to do for it? <endOfText>
<human> Nothing today since its Thursday, hopefully I can bar hop this weekend. Waiting for gifts today. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you get lots and lots! <endOfText>
<human> me too. I love goodies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so excited to move to a new state, but when i moved into my apartment it was full of bugs! ugh <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Bugs really creep me out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> me too.. i really was freaking out. <endOfText>
<human> what did the landlor do about it? Did you have to call an exterminator? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disappointed by my manager when he told that I will probably get my promotion next year (not this year) <endOfText>
<human> Ugh.. that seems like forever away.. can you try to get it sooner?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh.. that seems like forever away.. can you try to get it sooner? <endOfText>
<human> No, I tried everything. It is like betrayed me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out last weekend and had a major accident. Guess what happened... <endOfText>
<human> Are you ok, you have to tell me what happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last night I was driving down this road and my car died and I had no lights. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That must have been scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My house feels like its taking forever to sell...but I have a feeling something good is going to come soon! <endOfText>
<human> How long have you been trying to sell it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's been almost 3 months now, but not 1 offer. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you will sell it soon! 3 months is not such a long time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been going to school for whar seems like forever. <endOfText>
<human> Did you wait a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently, I have been annoyed by a coworker making jokes about me. <endOfText>
<human> Shame on them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter fell the other day pretty hard, I had to hold her until she calmed down. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's scary, is she okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it wasnt too bad just a couple scrapes, its hard seeing your kids get hurt. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, I'm glad it wasn't serious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really dislike my neighbors. They are the worst. <endOfText>
<human> What are they doing that is upsetting you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last Friday I was driving home from work and this guy just cuts me off in traffic. <endOfText>
<human> That happens a lot. What happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I to swerve onto the shoulder and almost caused a accident. Some people are just jerks on the road. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. I hate driving now. Everyone is looking in their phone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So this is going to sound crazy but, one day I am going to win the lottery. <endOfText>
<human> That would pretty amazing. What will you do with the winning? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pay off my debts from moving number 1, and then buy a house! What would you do with the money? <endOfText>
<human> I think the same really. Making sure everything is paid off, having a roof over your head, etc... is what most people would want to take caer of first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will pass a examen next monday. I reviewed all the content for the course <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! Studying can be a real challenge sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month, my boss gave me a 10% raise, even though I didn't ask fo it. It was quite the welcome surprise! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Probably he think that you are doing a great job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've lost my job and am behind on my mortgage. It scares me that I could lose my home. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful, I'm sorry to hear that. I lost my job once as well and times got really hard. What kind of stuff are you doing to try and avoid that outcome? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last week I was supposed to meet Mary and workout with her. But I kind of lied... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That's not right. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently someone offered me an extreme amount of money for a work at home job... <endOfText>
<human> wow! That's awesome! Did you accept the job offer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sounded too good to be true honestly it made me feel a little uneasy... i had to turn it down! <endOfText>
<human> yes, i understand. sometimes you just get a gut feeling that something isn't right <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i applied for 200+ jobs and i can't believe i didn't hear from none of them! <endOfText>
<human> Bummer!!! Are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Bummer!!! Are you looking for a work at home job or just an outside job? <endOfText>
<human> just any job at this point. just a full time stable job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear ya.. I hope you find one soon... wishing you all of the best! <endOfText>
<human> thank you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I went into my kitchen and ate all of my kids cookies. <endOfText>
<human> I do that all of time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have lived in my apartment for 5 years now. <endOfText>
<human> O wow that is a long time, Are you happy with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently moved to my dream location, but it sucks not knowing anyone. <endOfText>
<human> congratulations! I know, it probably feels lonely. Maybe you should do a party at your house and invite all the neighbours <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i saw a snake outside my apartment today, i hate snakes, so disgusting eww <endOfText>
<human> I would have went running like forest gump - what did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would have went running like forest gump - what did you do? <endOfText>
<human> went back inside the house and called animal control. it looked like a copperhead so i'm not messing with them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to have to burn the whole house down now, and move... LOL just joking! <endOfText>
<human> i totally would. lol i hate snakes and bugs and spiders <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So they just posted online about how they are not making a sequel to Hot Fuzz. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did they say why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to save a blind lady from falling down an escalator. <endOfText>
<human> Is she ok? Im glad you were close by! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sick of my job not paying us for the proper amount of hours! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Employers just don't value their employees sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It seems like it doesnt it.. i hope it gets better. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so, too. Have you considered working elsewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mowing the lawn, and a rock flew and broke my neighbor's window. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no... were they relaxed about it or did it cause a problem? <endOfText>
<human> They didn't even know what happened, but I got myself to let them know although I was terribly scared of the expenses. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hadn't worn a bathing suit in maybe 5 uears until recently. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed away unexpectedly a few years ago. <endOfText>
<human> oh no sorry to hear that. I just lost mine in November. It's hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could work less.. i feel so bad that i dont get to spend as much time with my daughter. <endOfText>
<human> I hear ya. Anyway to get a new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ive been trying what I really need is a higher paid one so that way I dont have to work 2 jobs. <endOfText>
<human> Got ya. What kind of work do you currently do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend called someone a bad name, he really mad me upset. <endOfText>
<human> I dont like rude people either did you tell him?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont like rude people either did you tell him? <endOfText>
<human> I did and then we got into a argument about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My fence is collapsing at areas where my neighbors keep climbing over to get their ball. It's going to be expensive to fix. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah I am sure it is.. have you talked to them about paying for it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah I am sure it is.. have you talked to them about paying for it? <endOfText>
<human> I'm afraid to unfortunately. They broke the window once, and I had to get police involved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to relocate and move again. I am so ready. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Have you been to many places? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> New York, VA, FL... how about you? <endOfText>
<human> I've been in the same place. DC and then its neighbor, MD. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother usually doesn't do anything for me unless asked. After 3 decades, he actually took me out for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> MY brothers are the same way. At least yours ginally came around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today is my birthday and I got a call yesterday wishing me a happy birthfay from my ex. <endOfText>
<human> Happy Birthday! Is the call from the ex a good or bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old high school is being sold and turned into an old people's apartment complex. Sad to see it go. <endOfText>
<human> Nostalgia. Is there another HS nearby for the kids to go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my birthday and my mother came to surprise me. <endOfText>
<human> Aw thats so nice, how did she surprise you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw thats so nice, how did she surprise you? <endOfText>
<human> She showed up to my house and brought me a cake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still remember the day i had to say goodbye to my dad. :( <endOfText>
<human> Thats too bad. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He had a heat stroke in the middle of July. <endOfText>
<human> Thats horrible. Sorry to hear. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today is my birthday! I think tonight we are all going out. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Happy Birthday to you! Where are you going?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awesome! Happy Birthday to you! Where are you going? <endOfText>
<human> I think to a amusment park but im not sure! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That seriously sounds like the best birthday ever... i hope you guys have an awesome time. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you! I hope you have a good dau. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was insane getting ready for hurricane IRMA to hit last year.... <endOfText>
<human> Did you get hit my it? I bet that was scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We did but it wasnt too bad, not as bad as the news made it out to sound. <endOfText>
<human> Im glad you are ok, How is your community. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor went back to school at 59. She just got her bachelor's this year. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's awesome. I went back at 31. Still going. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me sad to be single nowadays. <endOfText>
<human> Did you go through a breakup recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Happy Birthday! Well, you can order out of course. <endOfText>
<human> I think I will. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's boyfriend got into an accident 5 years ago. She's still with him. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to him? How are they doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been taking care of my aging mom for 5 years now and don't really have any friends, since so much time is used taking care of her. <endOfText>
<human> That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a nice thing you are doing for her though. Maybe you could hire somebody for a few hours a week and join a gym or yoga class. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you. Can't afford outside help unfortunatley. Yes. I have picked up exercising though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A little baby turtle was crossing the road the other day and I was in a hurry and didn't stop and help him. I hope he made it. I usually stop and take them to a creek away from the road. Darn! <endOfText>
<human> Can't always help unfortunately. I hope the little guy made it, too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They're so pitiful with their little heads up , like where are you mom, where did you go. <endOfText>
<human> I wonder how they get all the way to the road away from the other turtles! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom has arthritis in her neck, and the pain seems to be traveling down now. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry to hear that.. is there any physical therapy that can help her? <endOfText>
<human> The doctor just recommended exercise. I'm not sure if they were just busy to do anymore for her or if exercise is the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so impatient right now... waiting for the clock to hit 5 so I can go on vacation! <endOfText>
<human> How many hours do you have left? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my boss sent me over to close the deal with the Mr Harris. I felt so happy closeing a big client like that. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great, was the result good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom went back to school at 63 and recently got her bachelor's in computer science! <endOfText>
<human> Wow That's amazing. You must be very proud of her.  I think coding, etc, seems very hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally finished my Phlebotomy class . It was an hour's drive one way, but thankfully it's over and a hospital nearby is hiring I heard. Whew! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! How do you anticipate dealing with people who are afraid of needles? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would probably tell them to look the other way and that it really isn't very painful. <endOfText>
<human> That's good thinking. I hope you won't get too many who are afraid! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had a interview yesterday. I think it went pretty well. I hope I get the job. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good. Make sure you follow up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a lottery ticket and have a feeling I will win. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! I hope you'll win! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday was last weekend, and no one wished me a Happy Birthday. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. How sad for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For my 30th birthday, my family and friends got together and threw me a surprise birthday party. <endOfText>
<human> Very nice! Where was the party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The vet told me my cat only has a few weeks left to live. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so terrible! :( Im really sorry... you should do something special everyday and make memories!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats so terrible! :( Im really sorry... you should do something special everyday and make memories! <endOfText>
<human> I plan on it! He is really old so it is just his time to go and I get that but that doesnt make it any easier. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really doesnt.. i had to put my dog to sleep and it was extremely painful. I really hope that he can rest without pain and that you can feel better soon.. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah It is just one of those things we all have to go through at some point. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend tried to get me to go out to a bar and hang out behind my spouses back... <endOfText>
<human> Did you tell your spouse? I really think they should know. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I havent yet, but I agree with you I should. I just dont want them to be upset with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> Some would consider it cheating if you did not tell them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate being envious, but I've needed a car for months and my friend just bought a new one. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know what you mean... but for now maybe you can just car pool around with your friend until you can get one! <endOfText>
<human> I guess so. It is a really nice car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So you can ride in style for free. Sounds fair to me.. until you get yours! :) <endOfText>
<human> lol. i like you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to put my dog to sleep and it was super stressing! :( <endOfText>
<human> oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, it always sucks when you have to say goodbye.. but shes better off now without pain. Do you have any pets? <endOfText>
<human> I don't. My apartment won't allow, but we are moving soon I hope to get a cat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went out with my friends last night after not seeing each other for a year. I was in another country for work and just got back. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I bet that was fun and interesting visiting another country too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I found someone that's interested in my house finally . It's been on the market for over a year now. <endOfText>
<human> That can be stressful. I hope you get the sale. What will you do afterwards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I offered to start working extra long hours just to help support my family more. <endOfText>
<human> That's really considerate of you. Do they need your help a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah we recently moved so we have gotten in quite debt while trying to sell the previous home! ugh <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Home selling can be tough. I hope that debt clears up real soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just moved here for work, and I don't know anyone. My coworkers have families of their own. <endOfText>
<human> That's sucks. You just have to warm up to people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to grocery store the other day and completely embarassed myself. <endOfText>
<human> What happened?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to buy my christmas tree this year, lol.. funny right? ...but I am actually really excited. <endOfText>
<human> Do you usually get a live one ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought about it, but dont think I could handle one. Do you have one? <endOfText>
<human> Just a small fake one. Some people get really into decorating. I don't really like it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visited my old home town recently and it has gone down hill so much.  A lot of the houses are run down and dilapidated. So sad. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks..... always bad to see something like that. Did you atleast enjoy your trip?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks..... always bad to see something like that. Did you atleast enjoy your trip? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I got to see a few people I knew . It was still fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw thats good! Im glad you still had a good time. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you . Hope you get a vacation this year too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I came home from work yesterday and when I walked in the apartment Sally had all my friends and family inside. <endOfText>
<human> surprise party or intervention <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter started a new school last year. <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting and scary all at the same time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was excited when i was a child and found out my firned could come over and play <endOfText>
<human> life was simple then wasnt it! very cute.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> life was simple then wasnt it! very cute. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it was so much simpler. We got excited for the smallest things <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know what you mean. I miss being little myself. <endOfText>
<human> yes me too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the middle of a long distance move, and somehow misplaced my drivers registration and car insurance!!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is not good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I was so scared, and nervous.. it almost ruined the entire trip. <endOfText>
<human> Did you finally find it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So Bob got the promotion at work even though I put in all those hours. <endOfText>
<human> That's gotta be terrible. Why did they pick him instead of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor's kid just lost his eyesight. The whole family is devastated. <endOfText>
<human> O im sorry to hear that! How did it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once went to see fireworks with my best friend. Best day of my life. We're no longer friends. <endOfText>
<human> What a beautiful memory that you will always have though... have you tried to be friends again?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What a beautiful memory that you will always have though... have you tried to be friends again? <endOfText>
<human> No. I am too embarassed to reach out to her after all these years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I found something out the other night that made me extremely upset! <endOfText>
<human> What happened?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My child went out behind my back, and snuck out! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Guess they have finally reached that rebellious age. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I just saw how they are going to have a remake of Fist of Fury. <endOfText>
<human> I have no idea what that is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So after a year of being here we finally got to rearrange the garage. <endOfText>
<human> How is it looking?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How is it looking? <endOfText>
<human> I think we will be able to get two cars in here now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my cat of 10 years past away last night. I dont know what to do <endOfText>
<human> oh no. I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to give to charity. <endOfText>
<human> What charities do you like to give too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I lost my wallet and had to get a new ID issued to me. <endOfText>
<human> I hope someone turns it in soon to you.. did you lose out on money too?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope someone turns it in soon to you.. did you lose out on money too? <endOfText>
<human> I usually dont have much cash on me but the cards are hard to replace. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was impressed with the new Tesla that I test drove. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was rather fun, how fast did you get it going?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet that was rather fun, how fast did you get it going? <endOfText>
<human> Over 100mph. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I managed to change the oil in my car on my own without breaking anything... <endOfText>
<human> Thats great.I  change my oil all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I havent changed my oil in years since my dad taught me so... it was an achievement for sure. <endOfText>
<human> Yes my dad taught me also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should really try to get a girlfriend or something. I just need to feel someone. <endOfText>
<human> Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I just feel like it is no use. <endOfText>
<human> Dont feel that way... theres someone out there for everyone. Give it a try. :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Try online dating! Its actually really fun... have you tried it? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I just feel like it is no use.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dont feel that way... theres someone out there for everyone. Give it a try. :) <endOfText>
<human> OK I geuss I can try to apply myself more. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was for science but I had notes i had brought. <endOfText>
<human> Thats not right. How did you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma died. I am so sad. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. Was it from age or complications? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was at cheeleading last night and this girl did a double backflip! <endOfText>
<human> Did she land? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into Harvard. Can you believe it? <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is great! When are you going to start? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it annoys me that my wife keeps giving our son a stick even though he hurts himself every single time <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you say something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a trip over the weekend where we stayed at a nice hotel with a balcony overlooking the pool. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really nice! Did you stay near the ocean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes in Biloxi. The balcony had a downside though. The seagulls would always try to steal your food. <endOfText>
<human> I remember throwing food over and watching them catch it as a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I got in my car to go to work I notcied a note on my seat. <endOfText>
<human> What did it say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so sweet. Give him twenty dollars. <endOfText>
<human> I think I am going to take him out for icecream. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on a test. I am very ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> oh no :( maybe you should confess and i'm sure you will feel better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my family members as they all pretty much gone now... <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost died last year. <endOfText>
<human> That is a terrible thing to happen, I'm sure... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went for a dip at the pool late one night on vacation. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, how was the water. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid of ghosts. <endOfText>
<human> Mw too. I don't even llike when it's too dark inside or outside. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always am prepared for hurricanes. <endOfText>
<human> I live in Texas, We really dont have to worry about them here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i got a huge bonus at work last week! <endOfText>
<human> How much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My apartment is right near the dumpster for our commplex. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, does it smell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope I win the lottery this week. <endOfText>
<human> I think it's my turn to win the lottery <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is so annoying. <endOfText>
<human> what did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy when my son was born. <endOfText>
<human> awww. don't tell anyone but my son is my favorite child. I have two girls also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Halloween can't get here quick enough. <endOfText>
<human> I love Halloween. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went to pick up Lucy last night for our date. I was very polite and nice. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you meet her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy I graduated college. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! It has to feel like a huge accomplishment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got asked to my boss' office. Thought I was getting bad news but turns out I was offered a promotion. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. Did you take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have studied and am sure I will pass the test. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! Do your best. you sound well prepapred. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How about our president huh? <endOfText>
<human> I'm not actually in America so I don't share the same joy as you :p <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my new neighbors borrow our lawnmower. It came back broken. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Do you think they'll take care of it> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is being so lazy this summer. <endOfText>
<human> I think that's the usual for kids. How old is she <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to the police. I am ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> You should never lie to them. What did you say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to the beach the other day and remember how much my friend liked going together. <endOfText>
<human> oh, did you enjoy it? I love going to the beach <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate when you order food and it is terrible. <endOfText>
<human> I do. Makes me angry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to catch a criminal but he got away. <endOfText>
<human> Did he have a weapon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forget the lines in the school play. I was so embarrassed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were there a lot of lines you had to remember? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got stock from family a long time ago. I just let it sit there. It's risen 10 times since. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Have you looked to see how much it is worth? You could have some money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last night at work I lost my keys, I search the office for like 30 minutes. <endOfText>
<human> Did you find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just applied for a promotion, and I should earn at least 10k more. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Do you think you will get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last time I was at my parent's house I went through some old photo albums and started reminiscing. <endOfText>
<human> What did you think about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin just got out of a 7 year relationship. Turns out she was cheating for the last 3 years. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Wh don't people just leave insteading of hurting their partner. I don't get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you watch game of thrones? <endOfText>
<human> I watched the first season. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have had enogh of this summer heat. Cmon autumn! <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I love autumn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was content with a B on my exam. <endOfText>
<human> It is a passing grade. I would be fine with it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have a work presentation coming up soon. I think we've got everything to present. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Preperation is the first step in having a good presentation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, I met this girl one time on Tinder and I totally thought we had great chemistry, but then she completely ghosted me after. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst, I know how that feels, I'm kind of being ghosted right now myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see my friends on FB posting photos from my hometown I always start to miss it a little. <endOfText>
<human> Awww. Do you ever go back and visit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I havent been back yet but maybe I will in the winter so I can experience the snow again. <endOfText>
<human> Where is rou hometown? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is having a drink and paint party for her birthday tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are excited... are you bringing anything over with you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you are excited... are you bringing anything over with you? <endOfText>
<human> A bottle of moscato. She likes that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds yummy! Thats a good choice. Have a great time. <endOfText>
<human> We will. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was The Rock. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of rock would you want to be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was prett slow to start speaking. <endOfText>
<human> /Did you get him a teacher? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when Trump won the election. <endOfText>
<human> You? I thought I was dreaming <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, how are you? <endOfText>
<human> I'm doing pretty alright, what about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the worst time last week. I went with my girlfriend to see one of her friends and she talked to him with so much more energy and passion than she does with me. <endOfText>
<human> I really wish I could NOT correlate to that.  But I can.  Me and my girlfriend are going through a weird time right now where she likes to tell me how hot other guys right to my face.  It is a terrible feeling, and I know exactly what you are talking about.  If it occurs a lot more I suggest you saying something about it, better to know the truth than dwell on it everytime. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was prepared for my History test due to studying. <endOfText>
<human> Was your history test hard even after all the studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe the Falcons blew the Super Bowl. I was there. <endOfText>
<human> Oh you were? I really am not a huge sports fan, so what was so big about this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was apprehensive to get married. <endOfText>
<human> Do you regret it now that you are? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let Daisy my cat out the other evening and she didn't come back home. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. How long has she been gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've seen a lot of animals killed on the highways. Its so sad. <endOfText>
<human> well I hope your cat returns safely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thanks , nice chatting with you <endOfText>
<human> you too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my apartment is terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Can you do any work to it. I know there are a lot ideas on pinterest to perk up a place. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it seems late, but I'm 19 and I went on my first date only about one month ago. <endOfText>
<human> How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I have some pretty decent kids. May be too soon to tell though. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, all kids are a little iffy, I think. Are you a teacher or do you mean your own children? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My transmission went out in my car at the worst possible time. No way could I afford to get it replaced or rebuilt. My dad was able to loan me $500 to get the new transmission, and my step dad was able to put it in. <endOfText>
<human> So is it working now? I need atransmission for an old volvo. I'm saving for a new car instead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Of course she does! Lol that's hilarious, but I know how hard teenagers are so it's kind of almost serious too. <endOfText>
<human> This was the most fun chat Ive had today. Enjoy yur day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had HELLP syndrom with first child. Spent all 9 months being pregnant with 2nd child worrying about the same thing happening. <endOfText>
<human> What is HELLP? I'm sorry you and your baby had to go through that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY car has been down for about a month. Every time I leave the house I see all brand new cars. <endOfText>
<human> I absolutely hate car issues.  Will you be getting it fixed or buying another one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm saving for a new one. I didn't even have it a year. <endOfText>
<human> Did it have any warranty when you bought it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am always alone in the summer. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you alone so much in the summer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling really ambitious the other day and I decided to drive into the parking lot of my old elementary school just to see all the things I used to see years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Was it as you remembered it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law basically lives off of my mother in law and her kids get everything. My mother in law rarely gives our kids anything because we have the money to do it ourselves - and I get a bit miffed at times. <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling too, at least somewhat. Seems like clear favoritism to me, but maybe I'm wrong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like the new football coach. <endOfText>
<human> I like football, who are you talking about? what team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud to be an American. <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling!  Are you involved in any political or activists groups? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We tried for a baby for a long time, almost 4 years. Waiting those 9 months to meet her were so hard! <endOfText>
<human> Yes. I do not have any kids myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad I stole a cookie from the cookie jar. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. Did you get rid of the evidence? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been doing poorly in college for a while. <endOfText>
<human> Do you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a job interview next week. I'm feeling a little uneasy about it. <endOfText>
<human> Interviews can be nerve wrecking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a court date for child support. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that must of been a bit scary. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ok with being fat. <endOfText>
<human> It shouldn't matter what you look like, but why would you think you are fat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had jury duty for three months this spring. Its was surprisingly fun and interesting. <endOfText>
<human> I hate jury duty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe it hasn't rained today. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, so are you having nice weather,or is it too dry and need some rain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have had some big rain storms this spring and summer. The creek behind my house got in my yard twice. Very scary. <endOfText>
<human> oh no! that's scary! The house didn't get flooded, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not this time. But it did a little bit in 2009. and the mud and mess was unbelievably hard to clean up. <endOfText>
<human> i'm sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh I was so mad the other day, I went to the store and was grocery shopping. When I came out, I noticed my car was very scratched on the back bumper. I was so furious and angry, and I still am. <endOfText>
<human> That's actually so frustrating! No note left on your car or anything from the other driver? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm still kinda bummed about this, but like a month or more back I was really into this girl from Tinder and we started dating too. Unfortunately, after like 4 or 5 days, she said she wanted to stop dating and hasn't spoken to me since. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that really sucks. That's awful that she wanted to end things, especially since you were really into her. I am sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a really good time on our vacation a couple of weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> Thats sound nice. I went on vacation to Thailand last week. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know what that feels like. It must have been exciting! <endOfText>
<human> We had a great time!  We both have small kids so they loved playing together, and it was nice to get to help show our friends the ropes and all the 'secrets' lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a really bad experience. Especially since I wasted all the ingredients! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, was it an important meal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it was my nephew's birthday party pizza. And I promised him I would make his favorite pepperoni pizza! <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad!  What did you end up doing instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very afraid in airplane because of severe turbulence. <endOfText>
<human> Yes airplanes make me feel queasy too. What do you do to cope with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is something that was really important to her, and I still feel bad that I missed her 15th birthday <endOfText>
<human> Who is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed taking care of my nephew yesterday. His mother had left him with me since she had work. <endOfText>
<human> That can be a fun time, it is nice to watch kids sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother applied for an Ivy League school this year, and we just found out he was accepted! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I am glad to hear about that  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice, I am glad to hear about that <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it was vey exciting news, I'm so proud of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying to sell my house for 89k dollars, I have been in a bad financial situation, my nephew knows it, and now he is trying to buy my house just for 75k, trying to take advance of my situation <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's terrible. Why would he do that to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no idea, I guess his husband is evil <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you're having to go through that, I hope you're able to sell the home for a better price. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother graduated high school, I was very proud of him! <endOfText>
<human> I know that feel, my brother graduated a year ago, it's a really big milestone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finished all my finals a couple of months ago for my sophomore year of college. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been a burden lifted for sure! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really irritates me when my friend acts superior to everyone in the room, since he seems to think he is the best looking and strongest guy ever when really he's not at all. <endOfText>
<human> That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem  in ones self I believe.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's usually a sign of a lack of confidence or self esteem  in ones self I believe. <endOfText>
<human> That wouldn't surprise me. He has always been a bit insecure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been faithful to my girlfriend, I am proud of that in a way <endOfText>
<human> that's wonderful! i've never cheated on my husband either <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really want to lose weight. i know i can do it <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you can, it just takes dedication and effort is all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember waiting for the Nintendo Switch to come out, I was so excited <endOfText>
<human> I was also excited. In fact, I have one right now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! Have you been watching the FIFA World Cup recently? <endOfText>
<human> I have not, I did hear that England lost recently though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I slipped while carrying a tray of coffee at work the other day, got it all over me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, sorry to hear that! Were you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my parents picked me up from work in a new car for me when I turned 17, I was so surprised <endOfText>
<human> Did this make you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still my miss my partner, they left me all alone. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, maybe things will work themselves out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in preschool, my pants fell down in front of everyone <endOfText>
<human> That sounds embarrassing, what happened after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger, my grandmother passed away, I was so upset <endOfText>
<human> I loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so I understand how you feel.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved my grandparents on my mother's side , so I understand how you feel. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you, I hope nothing ever happens to them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's been a big white wolf or coyote around my yard the past few months. I'm afraid he will kill the neighbors cats. <endOfText>
<human> That is scary, what are you going to do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently invited me to his wedding. I hadn't even known he was engaged, but it was a great wedding. <endOfText>
<human> That's fun, my friend is getting married next year, how big was the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad used to be a pretty heavy drinker, it caused a few problems in our familiy. <endOfText>
<human> That is very sad, did he ever get sober? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't really know how to react to this, but one of my friends told me a few days ago that not only is he going to Samoa for a while (which didn't surprise me because he and his family go to Africa all the time), but he's staying and moving there for a few years. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's quite a move. Did he say why he's staying in Samoa so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke a vase at my mom's house last year, and ended up hiding the evidence. I still haven't told her, and I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that's a bad situation. Was this vase of any sentimental value, or was it really expensive or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I meant my DOG got into rat poison and died. It was a truly horrific accident. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is terrible, I hope he got to live a long life before that happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a huge scholarship when he barely passed the PSAT. <endOfText>
<human> How did  he manage to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty strapped for money back before my freshman year of college, so I really needed to get my 29 on my ACT up to a 31 for a scholarship. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get it done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend stole some of my money the other week. <endOfText>
<human> That is really awful. Did they take very much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so nervous going to the dentist today, I thought I would pass out! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did it end up okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yeah this Log even hit me square in the face and i ran out of the car. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, it's a wounder you did not get killed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any lasting damage? <endOfText>
<human> Nah, I did have shards of glass on me for a couple of days even after taking showers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was really annoying when I was thinking I would room with my brother back in freshman year of college, but it didn't work out as planned. <endOfText>
<human> It would have been easier to room with your brother isntead of a random roomate ,I bet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We moved to a new house last year and love it - and have spend much less working on projects and more time with the kids. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! That time with the kids will really be worth it, ultimately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i had some anger management issues as a kid. Makes me feel dumb thinking back. <endOfText>
<human> I did too, honestly. I have really improved them myself, good to hear that you have too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my first real drink back in October with some of my friends and I was really nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you nervous about it? Usually drinking means to loosen up and have fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't help but feel bad, since my friend has met a really good girl for him and I'm happy for him, but I wish I was in a good relationship too you know? <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand. But I guess as a friend you also have to be happy for him and one day you will get your happiness too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I won the honor society president election I was so confident in myself! <endOfText>
<human> I bet so. I've never done anything like that before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day my kids were being bad and I didn't feel well and I yelled at them. I felt guilty afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> I would not, they have to learn at some point! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents bought me a car when i turned 17, i was so surprised <endOfText>
<human> You must have been thrilled! There is nothing like a first car. Did you love it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when I got a new car. My parents surprised me so well <endOfText>
<human> Damn, I wish I had a car myself. What was the occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was at this party and a girl started to get really touchy feely and flirting with me, but I had a girlfriend at the time. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I asked my 7 year old what 12x12 was the other day, and he gave me the correct answer without hesitation. <endOfText>
<human> That's impressive, sounds like a smart young man. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man the first ever console i owned personally was a gamecube. Was so surprised getting it was funny what my parents did. <endOfText>
<human> Ahh yes,  must have been a very nice surprise! Did you play Mario on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still remember my high school days, I was a terrific athlete during that time. <endOfText>
<human> What athletics did you participate in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother graduated high school, I was proud of him <endOfText>
<human> When did he graduate? Sounds like a really cool moment to share with him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A month or two ago my girlfriend randomly broke up with me and I had no idea that she was even close to considering that. <endOfText>
<human> I am very sorry to hear that, that must be terrible.... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I reconnected with one of my childhood friends and I even got to go to the house that we used to hang out in years and years ago. <endOfText>
<human> That is something I want to do when I get older, I miss the golden days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed away when I was a child, it really upset me <endOfText>
<human> That's tragic, I haven't had to deal with anything like that yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a girlfriend, and I will never cheat on her <endOfText>
<human> So your saying your faithful and love her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i am really happy with myself lately. Finally graduated college after 8 years since 2009. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, go you! I am proud of you, it can be tough to do! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a girlfriend, and I would never cheat on her <endOfText>
<human> That is an amazing thing. Being cheated on is one of the worst things that can happen when ones enters a bond like a relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is coming from France to visit us. I am happy to see her again. <endOfText>
<human> How exciting, are you from France? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started working out again and it was nerveracking to begin again. <endOfText>
<human> Great. How long did you stop working out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning I was running late for work, and I got so mad at the driver in front of me! <endOfText>
<human> Was the person one of those one people who goes like 5 miles an hour in a 65? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It made me feel really disappointed when my CV got rejected in the first place. <endOfText>
<human> How did you respond after rejection? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My finances are not the greatest lately and I've been so worried. I haven't been sleeping due to stressing about this situation. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, I hope things turn around for you soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my coworkers food recently, I feel bad but they left it there for awhile <endOfText>
<human> HaHa What kind of food did they leave for you? Did you say anything to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I beat my classmate in a school election, even though she was way more popular <endOfText>
<human> omg congratulations! Thats a great achievement and must give you so much pride and motication for the future <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to florida one time and saw a childhood friend there, that was a surprise! <endOfText>
<human> You are right.Florida is a big state with lot's of people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am surprised England Lost to Croatia on the World Cup.I tought they were gonna win easily <endOfText>
<human> I am shocked too, Croatia only has 4 millio people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeaah they really were, number 12 killed it with that goal <endOfText>
<human> That goal took them to the world cup final <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents let me live in their house for free, I am realy thankful <endOfText>
<human> I feel that man, Parents like that care for their family a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeaaah, I know a lot of people who struggle with bills. <endOfText>
<human> I am in that boat at times where i live. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember a time i got my first retail job. Was scared about the interview but after just taking a deep breath. I just felt like i owned the place. <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling, good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i felt bad once because i broke my parents fax machine. What made me feel bad even more he got angry. <endOfText>
<human> well he did have a right to be angry (depending on how you broke it ofc) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a met with an accident once. one gentlemen saved my life <endOfText>
<human> I am glad to hear that, did you repay him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry when my brother ruined the result of a football game. I recorded it to watch later <endOfText>
<human> sibling fights worth living for.. I wish  i had one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely as a teenager, I had no girlfriend and few friends. I was sad often <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Do you have more firends now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I am so proud about myself. I just got promoted at my firm. <endOfText>
<human> Good job! I am sure that took a lot of hard work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> playing my gameboy makes me nostalgic. i love pokemon emerald the most <endOfText>
<human> Me to. I also play gameboy from time to time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone rear ended me a few months ago. I was very upset because I had places to be <endOfText>
<human> That is so aggravating! I've been in the exact same situation. I hope you weren't hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was terrifified when my dad scared me as a kid. I have to admit he was good at it <endOfText>
<human> I believe this kind of a rude attitude by parents leave an impression on the kid's growth <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really fascinated by Skiing and though about taking lessons to make it easy for me. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I could afford lessons or to even try, I bet it is really fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope the nintendo switch get madden on it. I love portable football games <endOfText>
<human> I like them too. I like to play football games while I'm eating Chik-Fil-A, but I always want to go on Sundays when they're closed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so happy about going to the lake with my wife, it makes me burst with joy! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! What are you planning to do at the lake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband mowed the lawn today and repaired our back fence. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's nice, you must have a hard-working husband. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am working very hard at getting new business and I want people to trust me. <endOfText>
<human> Those are both admirable ideas. How are you trying to improve trust? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Travel agents make complicated travel so much easier than using online sites. <endOfText>
<human> We do! It's very time consuming looking on line. Even with the cruise lines I'm going to get better deals and better cabin space for a client <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome. Best of luck to you with your business! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you very much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No one showed up to my birthday part so I ate by myself at home. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that! Happy Birthday! Hope you didn't eat the entire cake LOL! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, I was out hiking, and almost stepped on a rattlesnake. Thank goodness it alerted! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! That must have been frightening. What happened after it alerted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My last trip to the beach was amazing! I felt confident enough to wear a bikini! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I bet you had a great time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy. My grandmother is getting out of the hospital. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Is she better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope the immigrants children get reunited with their families <endOfText>
<human> Same. It is just a devasting thing that is happening.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it is.This problem in the border is very complex and emotive <endOfText>
<human> That is true. But this is basic humanity you know. Surely there is another way  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Same. It is just a devasting thing that is happening. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it is.This problem in the border is very complex and emotive  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a student in undergraduate school when this happened. <endOfText>
<human> When what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker got the promotion I had my eye on it.I am so mad and jealous. <endOfText>
<human> Damn, that sucks. What field do you work in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This past chrstmas, I was gifted my HP laptop, and I have been consistently using it ever since! It really was a great gift. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a nice gift! What are your main uses of it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit. <endOfText>
<human> I've heard great things about Reddit but have never actually signed up myself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's such a nice gift! What are your main uses of it? <endOfText>
<human> Mainly Youtube, I do some freelance work on it occasionally, and Reddit. Lots of Reddit.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i had this annoying little cousin. He went into my room when i wasn't there and got my computer fried because he spilled coke on the desk and into the computer. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good at all. Did you lose any important data? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview last week for a part-time-job and I hope I get it it. I have been an unemployed student for 6 months and the work would help! <endOfText>
<human> I will send all the good vibes! Is it in a field you could see yourself making a career of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, it is unrelated to my career field and temporary work. Thanks for the good vibes. Waiting to hear back from an interview is nerve racking! <endOfText>
<human> Always, it is. And it sounds empty to say "it will all work out for the best"....but it will! In the meantime, are you applying/interviewing for other positions? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so annoyed that France is in the world cup final. I do not like their style of play <endOfText>
<human> What is it about their style of play that you're not a fan of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so surprised Roger Federer lost yesterday at Wimbledon. he is the GOAT of tennis. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not too familiar with Tennis, Is he known to be a winner?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not too familiar with Tennis, Is he known to be a winner? <endOfText>
<human> He is the best player ever.He won the mos grand slams titles. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my wife and I got married, we knew we wanted to have kids.  When we found out that we were expecting, the only thing on our mind for the longest time was if we were having a boy or a girl. <endOfText>
<human> What exciting news! Did you find out ahead of time what the gender of the baby was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so happy and relieved my mom came to my rescue this week. <endOfText>
<human> Moms are good at doing that, aren't they?  What did she do for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You tend to feel really low when you travel frequently. I believe it's because you miss family & friends <endOfText>
<human> yes, especially if you travel a lot and for a long time. Is it for work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He just took his lunch box, have a last look at me and said : I hope they will be nice. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds very sad. I am very sorry to hear you experienced that. <endOfText>
<human> Not sad at all. He was so happy, but of course a little bit anxious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's terrible! I suppose sometimes things backfire, no matter how good our intentions are. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, no. That's awful! Did you report something that had occurred at your job? <endOfText>
<human> I sure did, thankfully I've been there a lot longer so they know me well enough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my best friend last year when he moved to Chicago because he got accepted into a master's program, and he made me feel like our friendship meant nothing since he was going on to do bigger and better things. <endOfText>
<human> That can be pretty hard to swallow, do you stay in touch? It's easier these days with the likes of social media. How do you fill that void? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We don't really stay in touch anymore. He and his fiance invited me to their wedding, though. He's not a social media person, and I'm not either, so we've basically lost touch. I haven't filled the void, unfortunately, but I feel okay about it now. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a shame, we grieve any kind of loss, I suppose. Perhaps the wedding would bring you closer together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe it will. I'm not sure, but I feel more happy for him now than I do envious and hurt. So, whatever happens, happens. It's okay. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it works out for you, life is too short. Fill your life with wonderful things and wonderful things will surely happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so disgust at Donald Trump and his immigration policies. <endOfText>
<human> I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stand behind him. Compared to the rest of the world we are to easy on illegal immigrants and this is coming from a Mexican American. <endOfText>
<human> It's coming form a traitor, you mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So you ever get those moments when you look like a idiot for not understanding what someone meant earlier. <endOfText>
<human> It does happen sometimes. Has it ever occurred to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually study hard and get my grades but sometimes it doesnt work out. <endOfText>
<human> Brain just wants to work against you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep, basically my brain just abandoned me at the critical moment. I was so disappointed. <endOfText>
<human> I would get that a lot in school back in the day i feel it's pretty normal to have those moments. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently broke up with my girlfriend and i feel so lonely. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man. That's rough. I'm sorry. Are friends helping? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started feeling a little anxious when my GPS just shut off <endOfText>
<human> Were you using it to get to a specific place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm hopefully that their will be peace in this world. <endOfText>
<human> I am hopeful as well, but because we are human beings, I doubt that will ever happen. There will always be the same old squabbles that have occurred since the dawn of man. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into the old abandoned house went and spent the night. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. Sorry you had to go through that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started my first government job two years ago. <endOfText>
<human> How do you feel now after so long being there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, we had a trying experience during Hurricane Irma, but came out OK. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been terrible. Were you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At first, there were no supplies. But yes, we ended up OK. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine it must have been very distressing. Glad that you were OK. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever have those days when everything just goes wrong? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, many. Would you like to tell me about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well if you're curious, I was on my way to work when my car broke down and I ended up missing a very important meeting about my promotion. I was devastated. <endOfText>
<human> Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During college, I was bullied. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible.  Were you able to do anything about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, my family went on vacation and left me all alone. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Did you feel lonely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid was fast enough to be a master of snowboarding after taking only few lessons last winters! <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty great! I am actually still a beginner with snowboarding. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i like being prepared for a lot of different situations when i go to conventions. <endOfText>
<human> True ! Conventions give you an opportunity to learn as you never know what kind of situations will prop up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm anticipating a very warm summer here in Dallas. <endOfText>
<human> Texas does that to us! It helps we live in a place where air conditioning is the norm. Or do you like spending time out in the heat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I hate you can't do anything outside and are trapped indoor its not nice. The only thing that I do is swim in my pool and cool off. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. It's like you have to dress for both the outside *and* the inside. That's great you have a pool in which to escape, though!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago, we had a terrible storm, and my apartment flooded. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went back though my old high school as part of a reunion.  It brought back many memories. <endOfText>
<human> Were they fond memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> By mistake, I saw an image of a car accident. I was disgusted. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that sounds awful! was it graphic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend cheated on me while I was away visiting family. I was very angry and upset <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear about that. Did you ask him to move out of the house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I was at this talent show recently. I saw this guy playing a whole song by himself it was crazy. <endOfText>
<human> What song was it? Did you know it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty much the IT guy among my friends. Always ready to fix computers for them. <endOfText>
<human> I consider myself somewhat knowledgable about them too, it's very fulfilling being able to help other people with their problems sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed up on something, but was told I could redo it <endOfText>
<human> Did you take that chance and redo it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was tired the other day at work because my boyfriend kept me up all night. So annoying. <endOfText>
<human> I know that pain!  Did he keep you up watching tv or video games? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss called me the other day to tell me I would be receiving a package the next day.  No other info, but she told me not to open it until I called her. <endOfText>
<human> So have you gotten to open it yet?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day I ate a piece of cake that my mom made for my dad as a gift, oops. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Well what he didn't know won't hurt him.  Hopefully you can get a replacement. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had to put my cat, Blackjack, to sleep. <endOfText>
<human> Thats unfortunate. It is a difficult decision to make. Sometimes we are put in those situations and they take a toll on us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a hot summer day and the sirens went off in the grocery store. I was about to leave the grocery store until the lady next to me with 2 kids stopped me to ask if I can assist her. I carried one of her kids out of the grocery store. It seemed that she felt comfortable around me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! You must have a very trusting face! That was very nice of you to help her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to help others! It was not an easy thing to do, but it seemed like it was the right thing to do. <endOfText>
<human> It definitely was! How old do you think her kids were? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, i went to a restaurant and they had a pinball machine. <endOfText>
<human> Did you play it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a homeless man sweating in the sun the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I imagine that made you feel empathetic to his plight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made plans to spend time with my friend Megan today, and unfortunately, I had to reschedule yet again. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. Do you like her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was attacked in the street by someone who stole my bag. I was so scared that I had a panic attack. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you report it to the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last year I let my friend borrow my car, and that night he ended up crashing and totaling it. I was crushed. <endOfText>
<human> No! THAT is painful! He must have felt awful! Did he have insurance to cover anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So lately my most fun experience I've had was when the Capitals won the Stanley cup finally. <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting when your team wins, have you always been a hockey fan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my daughter was  born I was so happy and excited. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! always good when new life is born. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, she is the first granddaughter in our family. Every one was excited to finally have a girl after all boys. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that must be a handful for your parents. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found out my mom was very sick. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.I hope she gets better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am impress by the Croatian team.They beat England and got to the world cup final. <endOfText>
<human> Wow I did not know that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been really disappointed? <endOfText>
<human> Of course! I'm human! ;-) Beyond the disappointments, I think it's how we respond that defines us, you know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time on a date I tripped right at the end and fell right on my face...the worst <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Was it a first date?  Or had you been out with this person before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One night, i hugged my wife and told her i loved her <endOfText>
<human> Aww! That's so sweet! How long have you been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to work and got a big raise. I rushed home to tell her. <endOfText>
<human> That's very exciting! Congratulations on your raise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was babysitting my 2 year old nephew and he tried to do a flip off the couch headfirst onto the floor! <endOfText>
<human> Please tell me you caught him!! That is awful!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworkers threw a party for me recently. <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of them. Was it for a special occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently thought I saw a ghost in my house. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you see it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Where did you see it? <endOfText>
<human> My bedroom! I was horrified! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really difficult time handling the 10th grade. <endOfText>
<human> What made it so difficult? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy that France is going to the final of the soccer world cup <endOfText>
<human> Wonderful! Your team I guess? That's exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a huge meeting coming up soon at work. <endOfText>
<human> What is it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the best day of my life was when i got a car for graduation. The day started with my mom giving me hints and such. I was wondering but thought it wasnt possible so I just refocused. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset the other day. I came home and my refrigerator was broken. <endOfText>
<human> That is such a stressful thing to come home to! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. Not only did I have to pay $1400 for a new one, I had to throw away all my food. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry you had to go through that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently went back to my home state to visit. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how nice! Did you get to visit with friends and family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had way too many beers last night, and stayed up a lot later than I had planned. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, what time did you end up getting to bed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Probably just before 6am, and I had to wake up for work at 9:30, so needless to say, I called out this morning. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know the feeling too well! Hopefully you get a good's night rest tonight. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so, too! And no beer tonight! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt get the assistant training position at my job, even though I have done better than the head trainer himself on the yearly test, 4 years in a row! <endOfText>
<human> Life is like that.  It is not what you know but who you know. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yup, guess I need to practice my butt kissing <endOfText>
<human> No need to kiss butt.  Maintain your integrity and enjoy life on it's terms. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a speech at work and I forgot what I was saying right in the middle. <endOfText>
<human> That's never fun.  Did you have any notes to help you remember? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently started in vitro treatments in hopes of getting pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I'm sure it will work. I've very hopeful for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am stressed by my blood test results that I will have tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What do you think will happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently applied for a job after being out of the workforce for 13 years! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congratulations!!! That can be both exciting and terrifying? Where are you on that spectrum? ;-) <endOfText>
<human> I'm so excited! But a little scared too. I hope I get it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was so let down when i didnt get the last job i applied for.". <endOfText>
<human> I've been in that boat. What do you think the issue was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to help my friend move out of their house <endOfText>
<human> how did that go?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> how did that go? <endOfText>
<human> It went ok, i was tired after <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was it a long move? <endOfText>
<human> Not really no <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have any friends when i was younger. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you have any friends?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why didn't you have any friends? <endOfText>
<human> Well i was socially awkward due to my learning disability at the time. I would also just sit at my computer and play games. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend who I grew up with recently passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that, what happened? <endOfText>
<human> A car accident. It was pretty tragic and terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my boyfriend once. <endOfText>
<human> Did you tell him, or did he find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing a team thing, and we won so i was happy <endOfText>
<human> what was the team activity?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what was the team activity? <endOfText>
<human> We had to do a presentation for a job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I went to the doctor  and had to get a shot. <endOfText>
<human> What is your health issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my coworker statue which was on her desk. I feel so bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, were you able to tell her you did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really dislike people that don't have kindness and have hate in their hearts. <endOfText>
<human> I SO agree. I would not want to live like that. And it's one thing if they're only affecting themselves -- but when it's aimed at others -- the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom just completed seven weeks of radiation treatments for breast cancer! <endOfText>
<human> How is she feeling? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my boyfriend commenting on another girls Facebook photos. <endOfText>
<human> How did that make you feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my phone <endOfText>
<human> OH I am sorry to hear that. How? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently studied very hard for a final exam <endOfText>
<human> I remember those days, what subject? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Physics. It was hard but very worth it. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds hard! What grade did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do miss the last decade.I was adolescent and had a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<human> I have the same feeling but for the last 90s and early 2000's. Being an adult is no fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was invited for a sleepover but we don't know the host family very well. <endOfText>
<human> Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you decline? I would not feel very comfortable until i got to know the family. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, and it was hard to decide because my son really wanted to go.  But you can't just trust anybody these days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While I was on maternity leave, I worked from home a little bit.  I don't think my boss liked it very much though. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well that isn't fair of your boss! Most people wouldn't work at all while are maternity leave, he should be grateful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stayed up until midnight and watched ESPN to see who would acquire him.  I thought he would end up staying in Cleveland. <endOfText>
<human> Do you mean LeBron James? I was hoping he'd come to Miami! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I do!  Wow, if he went to Miami that would've been crazy! <endOfText>
<human> I wish he would have! The Heat can use his help! Haha! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so shocked that my husband bought me tickets to see my favorite NFL team, the Steelers, in Jacksonville! <endOfText>
<human> That must've been awesome.  I've only been to one NFL game and it was wild! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My apartment was robbed. I was totaly devastated by seeing the damages and what was stolen. <endOfText>
<human> Wow I am so sorry. That had to be so scary.  Were the cops able to find any evidence? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I went to dinner tonight and were looking at pictures of our kids when they were really little. <endOfText>
<human> How sweet! How old are they now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried OkCupid last year for the first time...the first girl I met was decent in the pictures, but turned out to be a bombshell in person... <endOfText>
<human> I do not like OkCupid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was Brad Pitt. <endOfText>
<human> I wish i was Chris Pratt but why do you wanna be "The Pitt" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So when i got Pokemon for christmas was i was a kid i was so surprised i lost my mind i was so happy and hyper. <endOfText>
<human> I love Pokemon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I fail at school I get so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you fail? Do you not study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was Donald Trump. His life is amazing. <endOfText>
<human> You can be the next trump if you work hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried all day when my grandma died. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. You two were close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh, I was so embarrassed with myself the other day for snapping at a sales lady. <endOfText>
<human> Hey, it happens sometimes. What was the situation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when Jordan hit that game winning shot against my Utah Jazz in the late 90's.  Still can't believe it. <endOfText>
<human> I know that must have been so disappointing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is an over the road truck driver and I dont get to see him a lot. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  It must be difficult to be away from the one you love. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend Phil really bugs me. <endOfText>
<human> Does he have good characteristics too, or is he just annoying all the time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my father has done some dumb things. He missed a soccer game once and i was just not happy with him. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.  Do you play soccer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I sucked at talking to girls...now I'm getting numbers left and right <endOfText>
<human> Yeah when you break that fear from asking life gets A LOT better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I never lied to my dad. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you had a good reason. What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are having our family reunion this weekend. It should be a lot of fun <endOfText>
<human> I love family reunions. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I listened to a song the other day that reminded me of the past. <endOfText>
<human> What song was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Glycerine by Bush. It made me feel odd, like I was in the past. <endOfText>
<human> I've never heard of it, is it from the 80's? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 7 I was always the first to check for gifts under the tree on Christmas Eve.  I was disappointed when there was nothing there...but the next morning woke up to an Xbox 360 <endOfText>
<human> I have a Xbox 360. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will pass my English class. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. What makes you so confident <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was Batman. He is cool. <endOfText>
<human> He is cool. I would settle for a British butler. Is he your favorite super hero? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my vacation. <endOfText>
<human> So exciting! Where are you going again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel loyality is the strongest thing in a relationship. <endOfText>
<human> I agree completely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed IT, I was surprised. <endOfText>
<human> The movie or Information Technology? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for school to start. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! When do you start school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at my son. <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband brought me a birthday present last month that I was very excited to receive <endOfText>
<human> What did he buy you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was Elon Musk. <endOfText>
<human> I've heard his net worth is like $20.9 billion dollars!!  I wish I was him too - LOL! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People caring is good but i will say i have never cared as much for a creature than my first dog. <endOfText>
<human> I can totally relate. Dogs are better than most people. What kid of dog was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was a Dachshund lived til he was 18. I miss him still. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. Dogs take a piece of our hearts when they go. 18 years is a very long life for a dog, I bet you had a lot of great times together! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I saw a guy on facebook post a video of himself deadlifting 335lbs and getting attention from some cute girls...I had my buddy record me bench pressing 350lbs which is way harder...and felt much better after that <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you are strong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, my coworker are suprised how confident I am in being able to achieve difficult taks. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! It's important to have confidence in yourself and your abilities at work to be successful. It's a good example to set for your coworkers too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very sick when our first daughter was born. I developed HELLP syndrome with her and was in the hospital for 7 days. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's terrible!! What is HELLP syndrome? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was such a streeful way to start the day, with no prior notice to the management change, and there firing. <endOfText>
<human> I've been there when a new company bought us out. How did you handle it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been there when a new company bought us out. How did you handle it? <endOfText>
<human> We were giving the choice to stay or leave with severance package, I was so nervous and it was on the spot, I didnt know what to do at first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i yelled at my girl once and now thinking back it was so dumb of me to do that., <endOfText>
<human> Emotions run high - we all say things we don't mean. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had friends. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? Is there something wrong with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry at Donald Trump because he order the separation of children from their parents. <endOfText>

<human> What score did they get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy my brother plays in the MLB. <endOfText>
<human> He does?! So exciting! What team does he play for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the airport, I found my luggage broken and objects where stolen <endOfText>
<human> That must have been stressful. Did you report it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ripped my pants during the school play. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that sucks...I'd be really embarrassed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am from Royal Filipino Blood, the "Maharlika" meaning Chosen by the most high. Even though my country's been degraded for centuries by greedy colonizers I'm still repping my royal kin so people know where I come from. <endOfText>
<human> I am a male. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father in law was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer when our daughter was 9 months old.  She was his first granddaughter. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am afraid of heights. <endOfText>

<human> Oh, that is exciting. How big is your house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is something wrong with my sister in law.  She refuses to take her kids to the doctor for checkups or even when they are sick. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's pretty bad parenting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I didn't cheat on my now ex-gf <endOfText>
<human> Hindsight and all that - do you miss her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just injured my ankle. Now I can't work <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. How deid it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying my best to go on a diet. It's not going well. <endOfText>
<human> How much would you like to lose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 20 pounds. I always eat just because I have food. Maybe if I bought less food, it would be easier. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a plan! You can also try to see if there is less calorie version of foods you like. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm finding it super hard to move on from my last relationship. <endOfText>
<human> I know how that can be such a struggle.  How long has it been and why did it end? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband just finished taking all 4 parts of the CPA exam.  It took him almost a year to complete as he'd study for one part, take that part, then start studying for the next part. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Does he feel pretty confident about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to go to the beach.Its time to be sure I am all packed". <endOfText>
<human> I love the beach, the gulf is my favorite! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never been but all up and down east coast <endOfText>
<human> The Atlantic is not so bad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed away about 10 years ago.  I really miss her, she pretty much was the only female influence I had growing up. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.  My grandmother is all I have left. Grandpa passed 1 month ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was outside a bar and got my butt kicked by 3 guys in a streetfight.  I held my own pretty well until they got me with a couple of beer bottles to the face.  I never went down.  So I'm positive I can handle anyone who tries acting tough around me <endOfText>
<human> Wow - were you nervous or scared at all?  Did the police get involved? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I got a big gift in my mail. It was from an anonymous person. I never found out who gave it to me. <endOfText>
<human> That is fun! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What a neat mystery. I bet you wish you could thank them though. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I do. I tried to find out who that person was. never found out though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just lost my job, and I've got too many bills <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I'm sorry about that, do you have any family that can help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this time that I went to eat with all my friends for a special event and I forgot to invite one of my closest friends.I felt horrible <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you talk it out with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend woke up late and missed the final exam. Turns out he helped a blind lady get home. <endOfText>
<human> That was noble <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad surprised me one morning with a new truck. I was not expecting it all and it was just a great morning. <endOfText>
<human> That is an awesome dad. Do you still have the truck? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I miss my dog, Baby Girl, poor thing passed away last year after 15 years." <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is SO hard. It sounds like she had a long and happy life. I'm sure you miss her so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was thrown from her horse a few months back. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is she okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in the 2014 World Cup I was super excited when Argentina won against the Netherlands in the semi-final. It was crazy! <endOfText>
<human> So I take it you are a soccer fan?  It seems America is finally getting into the sport.  Do you play yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Might sell my home. It's the home I grew up in. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wao those a terrible news, is there any way to keep the house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my home to my neighbor to take care of, when I had to suddenly visit my mom in Canada <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you had someone to take care of it while you were away. Was you mother alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very joyful when I got into a college that I really wanted to go to, plus my friends were there already. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, congratulations! What a GREAT feeling. Are y'all all still good friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I try not to judge often...but if there's one thing I can't stand it's pedophiles..they just make my blood boil <endOfText>
<human> I watched a movie based off a true story on that once. It was truely a sad story for the little girl and her parents. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There are 2 cats that come by my home every night. I leave food out for them. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty sympathetic of you...but aren't you worried they'll start going through your trash <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My vacation is coming up in a month. I've worked nonstop for 9 months. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I'll bet you're ready for a vacation. Are you going anywhere special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I flew back to California a few weeks ago, it was beautiful flying in over the mountains. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds beautiful and serene. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really is, I miss the Sierra Nevadas very much, have you ever been? <endOfText>
<human> No I haven't. But now I want to see. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got offered a car as a gift. I really needed it. <endOfText>
<human> What an amazing gift to be given!  That truly sounds like a blessing for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother in law always lies and exaggerates things.  Sometimes the same story is told two different ways to both my husband and I. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you and your husband communicate enough to know that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is at the hospital getting checked right now. I think we might be getting good news about a new addition to the family. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, congratulations for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you so much. I can't wait to get the good news from her. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are both going to be happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got suspended for something he did not do in high school by a very vindictive teacher. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What a mature teacher. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just came back from a job interview. Seem to hit it off with the interviewer. <endOfText>
<human> That is great! Have you been looking for a job for long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dogs passed away 2 years ago. My family adopted me one this past weekend on my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear about your other ones...What breed is the new one <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the last cream soda from a pack that belonged to my buddy from the fridge when I was drunk. Didn't think it was a big deal until he told me he drove 5 hours just to get them and they were expensive. I felt kind of bad so I bought him a happy meal <endOfText>
<human> Was he okay with the happy meal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I broke up <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been studying really for my license exam. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will do well, it isnt too hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed my friends wedding because I was hungover, it was stupid and I still feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> People make stupid mistakes. How long ago was this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor's home burned down. There was an outpour of support from the community. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear, it's inspiring to see humans support each other in times of need I think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was recently a sale at one of my favorite local restaurants. I have no working vehicle so I couldn't go but a friend came and took me to catch the sale. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good friend. Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't wait for the local band competition this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Cool, want kind of music will the competition have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel for a friend because he got laid off and now cannot send their daughter to college next month <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope things get better for him soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally got a raise after busting my butt off for 5 years. <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask why it took so long to get a raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let a friend copy my answers for a test she did not study for and she made an A. <endOfText>
<human> How did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest daughter had a hard time with other kids in school. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, kids can be mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get a good feeling when I think back to a birthday I had when I was a kid and all of my friends and I got to see a really funny movie at the mall. <endOfText>
<human> Awww!  What movie did you go to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was at school and ruined my pants with milk <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks.  Did anyone see it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't sleep with the lights on after watching "The Sixth Sense" the first time.  When I closed my eyes I would see the poisoned girl staring at me angrily with vomit running down her mouth, with the abused lady behind her yelling..."YOU CAN'T HURT ME ANYMORE NEDDY!!!"". <endOfText>
<human> WOW that is super scary! are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Job interviews are hard for me because I get so nervous beforehand. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I haven't really found a good strategy to avoid the nervousness to be honest. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother was saving a piece of cake for my dad and I accidentally ate it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I accidentally eat cake all the time! It is too hard to resist. What did your mom do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was told to come back the next day after waiting over an hour in line to get my drivers license renewed. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. The DMV is just dreadful to go to because of stuff like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got a $1,000 scholarship that I even forgot I applied for last year. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is awesome! Bet you were shocked and happy at the same time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first dog, Tank, I got as a pitbull. He was with us 5 years. I loved that dog sooo much. After a family emergency came up we had to move. We couldn't take Tank so I had to let him go. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. Was he adopted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just went by the lake. Made me think of a friend I used to play with a lot when we were little. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice did you have fun? What lake? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get my license renewed and I had to wait over an hour at the DMV. <endOfText>
<human> The DMV really should be better by now. Did you get a chance to do anything during the wait? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I actually did not. I didn't get to charge my phone the night before, so while I was waiting, it died. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Just one inconveniece after another. It's no wonder people dread having to deal with the DMV. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just heard back from my boss about a promotion. He says it sounds good that I would get it. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! It seems like you really worked hard, what type of work do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to be really upset if I get passed over for another promotion. I've paid my dues. <endOfText>
<human> That is so hard, to feel like you've been looked over. Have you been able to have conversations with leadership as to why that might be the case? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had an existential crisis. It was awful <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughters little dog passed away about 4 months ago, it really shook all of us. <endOfText>
<human> i am so sorry for you.  I know what a crushing experience the passing of a beloved pet can be.  You must be very sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a girl, and took her on a date to a concert <endOfText>
<human> What concert?  Did you like her enough to go on a 2nd date? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my father. <endOfText>
<human> Did he pass away or not live close to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been at home homeschooling my girls for many years, but that time is coming to an end very quickly. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you decide to change their education? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not going to return to work after my maternity leave. <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just told me she likes me as more than a friend. <endOfText>
<human> How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so jealous of my friend Eric <endOfText>
<human> Why are you jealous of Eric? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend always does thing thing that gets me so jealous. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe he has no respect for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a young girl, and mother of a two year old, my own mom passed away. This was a very sad time for me as I'm an only child and my father wasn't around either. <endOfText>
<human> Uhmmnnn,that could have been really emotional for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yea it was.  It still bothers me. Nobody should go through that by themselves. <endOfText>
<human> I understand, I've been there too,hope your getting through? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being a bit teary-eyed tonight realizing how grown my children are. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that all too well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The mummies at my local art museum are amazing! One that I saw was from the Roman Era. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that really old but not too old for mummies considering. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I ate the rest of my friends leftover food after going out and thought he didn't want it. <endOfText>
<human> What did your friend say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When a storm came through my town a few springs ago, I felt prepared. I knew when to leave and where to go. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been very frightening. Did you have somewhere safe that you went to> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for next february <endOfText>
<human> What is happening in February? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dealing with the passing of my mother-in-law was hard. My wife really struggled, I hope I did enough for her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry to hear that. When did she pass away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During the day today, I was in an Uber when it crashed. I'm just thankful no one was hurt! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! That is so scary. Thank goodness you are ok. Was it the Uber driver's fault? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really really love the snow, but we never get it.  Well a few years ago, my wish was granted! <endOfText>
<human> Where do you live? I live in Missouri and the snows can be brutal. We had a couple days at 0F this year. I hate it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How was work for you today?  It was long for me.  I got blamed for a report that had bad figures in it.  But I didn't provide those figures or type the report! <endOfText>
<human> My day was pretty good. I got to work from home and pack for my trip this weekend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my friend ruined Sons of Anarchy for me...I was only on season 2 and she told me about how they all die at the end I was sad and horrified <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. I hate it when people spoil shows! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very sick one day and we had to go to the local ER. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.. that sounds awful. What happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really scared when a tornado came down a few hundred feet from my house. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is scary, that happened to us a couple months ago! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like that I can be with my daughter during the day and not worry about her under someone else care. <endOfText>
<human> I completely understand. I stay home with my four kids and wouldn't have it any other way.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I completely understand. I stay home with my four kids and wouldn't have it any other way. <endOfText>
<human> It great and I don't have to worry about the house chores being done since I am the one who does it all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I do them all here too, they are never ending. <endOfText>
<human> yes! I hear you house work is my life. Being a mom is amazing though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A couple years back a stranger tried to take my phone. <endOfText>
<human> Interesting! Did you apprehend him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every year I'm so excited about Christmas and have all these plans. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, how does Christmas in July work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got lucky and passed my course this semester <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law should have never had children.  Yet she was able to get pregnant right away. <endOfText>
<human> Never had children as in infertile or a bad person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped the other day on a stair becuase one was slightly higher than the others. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a bad spot when my mom passed away randomly a few years ago <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear about that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I was so upset when my dog jumped up on the table and started eating my child's birthday cake! I really yelled at the mutt! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope your kid wasn't too upset. Maybe need to lock the dog in another room when food is out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, last week I almost got into a crash because someone almost hit me. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrifying! Let me guess, they were on their phone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is hard to express how I felt when my kids were born. It was as if my heart grew 3 sizes that day! <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine it was a great experience, not sure if I will ever have kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We made the decision to homeschool our girls years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you make that choice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The street I was on had the buildings right next to the sidewalk and the cat has fallen out of it's window. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, your cat fell out of the window?  Is it ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The night WS the longest to me back then,eager to know my score! <endOfText>
<human> Did you think you did well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend lied to me about why he did not come to my moms funeral. It was stupid at the time but I am still upset about it. <endOfText>
<human> He should be there for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Trump embarrass me a lot. <endOfText>
<human> He is not for everyone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a difficult falling asleep before a job interview <endOfText>
<human> Do you get to anxious about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy lately. <endOfText>
<human> What are you feeling happy about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am faithful to my wife, but it's thought. <endOfText>
<human> Cheating on her? I am in a relationship and not married, and I have the thought too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel terrible about not listening to my child's complaints about being picked on. What was I thinking? <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.  How old is he / she <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never knew what to expect at these bachelorette parties...as a male stripper I always expected some lonely old cat ladies looking for company...but almost every single time they turned out to be gorgeous chicks in their 20s <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is quite lucky for you! I bet you made some good tips as well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will never forget the day I became a father. It was such an amazing experience. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine because becoming a mother was the best time in my life! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my parents bought a new puppy for my younger brother. He had no idea it was coming and was so happy and excited! <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet! Did he end up crying when he saw the puppy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a motor accident, they were really helpful indeed <endOfText>
<human> oh my! I graduate this year in a short few months. I worked really hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very confident on the French Team. <endOfText>
<human> Are you referring to the 2018 Games in Asia? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bad storm was coming in just as I was leaving for the airport so I brought extra snacks in case I got delayed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's good you prepared but that's terrible timing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Gosh it is already 11:30pm and my kids are still awake! <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst!. Mine was up extra late tonight too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It stays bright so late nowadays that it's impossible to get them to go to bed. <endOfText>
<human> I know. We just read a bedtime story where the mom paints a night scene on the child's blind to make her feel better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister and I lived close to each other then I moved an hour away. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! I was college roommates with my sister and now we live hours apart. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am an ESL teacher and one of my 3 year old students came to school singing an entire song all about the planets. It was so cute! <endOfText>
<human> Awe, I bet you felt so proud and happy for them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awe, I bet you felt so proud and happy for them. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it was a really special moment for me. Little kids that age are so cute! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend decided to jump out and scare me one day. I was so mad and embarrassed that I flinched. <endOfText>
<human> Did she jumped really high or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife left me and i am so lonely. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ma very proud of my son <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I be so. How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> he is 18 and got accepted at MIT. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congratulations! That is such an accomplishment. He must be very bright <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really nervous when starting a new job a few months ago.. <endOfText>
<human> That is normal.We all get nervous on our fist day of work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year is absolutely flying by! <endOfText>
<human> I think so too! I swear it was like 2012 yesterday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes for sure. Waiting for Christmas as a child was like FOREVER and now as soon as Christmas ends it feels like we are shopping for the next one within a millisecond lol. <endOfText>
<human> Right? I didn't think about that. I miss time passing by slowly and being so excited for everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I used to fill lonely in college - my senior year. I was studying all of the time and single. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Are you doing better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an awful time getting gas today at 7/11 because of someone there. <endOfText>
<human> No way! What happened...was there a confrontation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, except this art was wearing baggy sweat pants today. <endOfText>
<human> Haha. Well, who can judge art, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister made some toast and left it on the counter. So I ate it and inferred the dog must have taken it when she asked. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty funny. Did your sister ever find out it was you who took it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must have been terrifying. <endOfText>
<human> What would you have done in that situation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family disowned me a few years ago. I heard that they were going on the annual family lake trip next week. Thinking about it made me really sad as I remembered all of my childhood memories on this trip. <endOfText>
<human> Awe, I am sorry to hear that. Do you think there will be any chance of a reconciliation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know, I have been waiting five years and have sent many emails to my mom  but she seems too angry. I hope so one day but it seems less likely every day. <endOfText>
<human> I know it isn't my place to ask, but why did they disown you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was about to eat ,opened the pack and it was a pizza ,you could have imagined! <endOfText>
<human> Serious? Don't you like pizza? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just saw a naked man run through my neighborhood. It was so weird. <endOfText>
<human> Haha that is terrible! Unless he was hot... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter's dentist appointment went so great today! <endOfText>
<human> Oh really?! Is she not afraid of the dentist? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am furious at Donald Trump <endOfText>
<human> You and the rest of the world, lol. Joking. Joking. Why are you furious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever get those moments where you wonder where life would be if you did one thing differently? Like for me, I always feel embarrassed to think if I hadn't gone to college, maybe my life would be easier?... <endOfText>
<human> Of course, hindsight is 20/20. But going forward you can live in a way that minimizes regret. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh I am so sick of working overnight shifts, but I am nervous to start something new. <endOfText>
<human> You should always be confident and take risks in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to Disney makes me so happy <endOfText>
<human> I second that. I've been to all the parks a bunch of times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Growing up  ,I had prospects,would I be rich ,or would I be poor ,lingered on my mind..Lol! <endOfText>
<human> Work hard at it,poverty is no joke. Not an option! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I submitted my application for a credit card with Chase. Thankfully, I was approved and was really glad <endOfText>
<human> That's great! You must have good credit.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great! You must have good credit. <endOfText>
<human> Indeed. It was my fifth credit card that I have now among others <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Moving to a new age bracket is scary. <endOfText>
<human> In what way are you fearful? I've never thought about that before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in 2013 I won an NCAA bracket challenge online through a local restaurant. The payout was $1,000 cash. I was really excited...felt great. <endOfText>
<human> Wow... That is exciting. Congratulations! I also won my fantasy football league this year and won $300 as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece just turned two and it's weird reading her the books I read as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. Seeing my friends kid read the books I used to read brings back great memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my fondest memories was when I went on an airplane for the first time as a child. <endOfText>
<human> I still love going on planes. Makes the headaches of airports worth it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my wife, i think. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say it like that? Is everything okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very sad these days <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. Is it related to your work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a presentation to prepare for this week and I am finding it really hard to meet the deadline. I am so stressed <endOfText>
<human> Keep calm.That is the very important step you should take. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last night I snuck into the kitchen at my cousins house. <endOfText>
<human> I hope they are good cooks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> WIsh that did happen to you, better luck next time. <endOfText>
<human> I always have the worst luck.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always have the worst luck. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, sometimes I think it's karma. Maybe all the bad things that I did are coming back to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a package over a month ago and it finally arrived. <endOfText>
<human> What did you order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so wonderful to just relax at home on the couch with my family after a long day. <endOfText>
<human> That is my favorite thing to do. I am sure they are glad when you are home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my Grandmother passed away, it was really hard for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness I bet! I am sorry to hear that you went through that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I reflect upon my life, and at this current moment I am happy with where I am. <endOfText>
<human> That's great you are happy with where you are in life. I think the place we work and the area in which we live make a big difference. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very impressed with the food today at Outback restaurant. Everything was delicious. <endOfText>
<human> I love to eat there. One of my favorite foods to eat is steak. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very devastated these days. <endOfText>
<human> That seems bad and I am sorry to hear that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so hard to cope with loneliness. Especially after my break up <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to heard that.How long were you together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for next Sunday <endOfText>
<human> Why?  Is there something good going to happen on Sunday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, the world cup final between France and Croatia <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah!  Allez les bleus!  But good on tiny Croatia for even making it that far.  That's an incredible story for them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My van did a really good job on a pretty long, 5 hour trip lately. I was doubting it'll make it because I've had problems with it for a while. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. That's always a good feeling.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice. That's always a good feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I felt so relieved and kind of shocked after I got to my destination. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had the chance to betray a friend of mine, but instead I stayed faithful. <endOfText>
<human> It's so good you stayed loyal, I think anyone would've appreciated a friend like you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We can all hope. I think most people would've acted the same way. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah because faithfulness is what defines a true friendship, after all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a tough day at work <endOfText>
<human> Awe, I am sorry. What made it tough? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If I work hard In it,I'll achieve it! <endOfText>
<human> I agree with that. Victor mentality.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree with that. Victor mentality. <endOfText>
<human> Sure ! I know I can! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knocked my favorite glass off the table and now I have to find a replacement. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How disappointing. Hopefully you didn't cut yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so crazy to me. My best friend and her husband have an open marriage and I just cannot fathom having another partner other than my husband. <endOfText>
<human> I always wondered how you start something like that up with your partner without hurting their feelings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost got into a wreck today because someone cute me off on my way to work. <endOfText>
<human> How terrible! I bet your heart stopped in that moment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Homeless people are very unfortunate. It breaks my heart seeing them living in desperation <endOfText>
<human> I feel you.I also get sad when i see people living of the street. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very apprehensive nowadays, <endOfText>
<human> Why? Is it something with your work-life balance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I had to put my dog to sleep.  It was really sad because I had him for 16 years. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I am so sorry. That is so hard. My daughters cat got run over like a week after we had him. :( What was your dog's name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so disappointed on my son. <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sometimes wish I could go back to high school and be a kid again. <endOfText>
<human> I certainly don't. I was miserable as a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been looking for a job for months, going on interview after interview and I finally went on one that I am really interested in but I have been waiting all week to find out if I got it or not. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I hate the waiting game. What's the job for? Have you tried calling back and checking in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Teaching sounds good. We seriously need more amazing teachers. I'll pray that it will all work out for you. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you so much!  I really appreciate that!  I feel like I've been waiting forever! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a toy for my niece's birthday in the mail and figured I could put it together without any directions. <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to finish right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my mother deeply. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. We're you close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family just left on a trip for a week and I had to stay back to work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's too bad. How long before they get home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's so true! I think they will have fun but I will miss them being all alone in the house. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope it goes okay and for you the time passes fast! <endOfText>
<human> thanks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other night my grandma wanted to video chat to say hi to her great grand kids. My four year old was showing off his counting skills and some other cute stuff he had learned. It made my grandma really happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet!  Modern technology is amazing, right?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't wait for summer time to come <endOfText>
<human> It's summer now for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for next Sunday <endOfText>
<human> Really? The world cup right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working so hard and it seems my payment can no longer take care of my bills <endOfText>
<human> This has to be a very stressful time for you. How are you holding up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was pretty shocking for me to learn that I have failed my Calculus exam when I had studied so hard for it <endOfText>
<human> Ahhh.  Math.  I have certainly been there before.  I am so sorry!  Is there any way to retake it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been going on interviews for 4 months and today I finally got a job!  I am so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. You finally did it. What is your occupation now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On mother's day my kids and I had a nice relaxing morning just cuddling in bed. My spouse made breakfast in bed and we all just hung out together. It made me feel so peaceful and happy. <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear. I can tell your family loves you a lot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh thank you that's a nice thing to say! <endOfText>
<human> It is nice we have days to celebrate mothers and fathers. They deserve the recognition for their hard work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt terrible when I realized I had accidentally run over my neighbor's garden. Oops! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you end up talking to your neighbor about it?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A light switch in my house stopped working and I was able to fix it without looking up how. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is impressive. I probably couldn't have done it with a tutorial how. I would have walked around with a flashlight until someone felt sorry for me and fixed it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got to work and ...Boom! It was my birthday <endOfText>
<human> Wow,happy belated birthday,make sure you have a blast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having a job interview tomorrow and it is my first interview ever <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous about it? I know I was when I had my first interview. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I buy a lottery ticket every day but for some reason I have not won more than $10. My luck will soon change! <endOfText>
<human> Well You can be hopeful. But i think you should  stop gambling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sad lately.  My husband needs a lung transplant and he is only 40 years old. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I'm so sorry to hear that. Was this an all the sudden thing or has he been in poor health? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first cat disaapeared 2 years ago after 14 years with him <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad. I just had a cat disappear, it's quite sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time in welding school I got 2 of my teachers a gig with a major contractor on FT Benning building ADA code railing for th new hospital and centers and stuff, <endOfText>
<human> Wow. They must have been very grateful to you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow. They must have been very grateful to you. <endOfText>
<human> It was pretty awesome, I showed up in school after they had gotten paid and he was getting out his wallet. He said he had something for me but it felt better telling him I didn't need it they hired me on full time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made some cookies from scratch and left to run an errand. When I came back my family had eaten most of them without asking. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, fresh cookies that you hand baked?? What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i think my performance is way better than the winner's perfromance <endOfText>
<human> come on now? you are so full of yourself!Why do you say so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am just saying what I feel. I put all my best into this and yet I lost to a poor performer <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the park the other day and dropped some money on the ground without knowing it. A kind stranger witnessed this happen and picked up the money. That person then returned it to me. <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome. Isn't it so nice when people do nice things for each other in their communities? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's great! That's really nice of you. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for listening. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I celebrated our sixth anniversary the other week. I was pretty sure he was planning to propose because of the nice plans he had made- and he was. For a couple of days leading up to it I was so excited and just could hardly wait. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is exciting for sure. You must have been filled with anticipation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really nervous.  I have to go tomorrow to get my tooth pulled and I am scared to death.  I hate the dentist! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate the dentist too! I haven't been in forever. I'm sorry. You will be okay though! Hoping it all goes well. Is it hurting you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So about 2 or 3 months ago I found out the Dallas Cowboys were letting Dez Bryant go and he's a free agent.  It's disappointing to me because I'm a Cowboys fan and I like him as part of the team.  Have you heard of Dez Bryant <endOfText>
<human> Sure, my dad is a Cowboys fan. He misses the days of Troy Aikman and Emmett Smith! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I experienced road rage the other day. I woman carelessly swerved in front of me, causing me to slam on my brakes. <endOfText>
<human> Road rage is a problem I deal with too.  I have adult add and tend to be impulsive and am horrible at socializing.  I'm glad your alright and I don't blame you for getting stressed out by that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my mom got sick i feel sick too. I cannot handle it <endOfText>
<human> Have you ever spoken to someone else about it? It's always a relief to talk things out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did you do to make it better? <endOfText>
<human> I eventually threw up. Anything you have to say though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everytime I see my cat vomit on the floor it makes me sick to my stomach. <endOfText>
<human> i think you have the same attitude like me. i really feel pissed off <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need someone to date so badly. I cannot hold it anymore <endOfText>
<human> My same exact sentiments, it can be lonely out here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt is coming to visit soon. I'm ridiculously excited because she always makes this desert I love. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What desert is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever had a time where you really needed a certain grade on a final to keep your letter grade? I did that in calculus last semester. <endOfText>
<human> Yea I know how you feel, I have no idea what im doing in math sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super shocked when I did well on my math final, thought i bombed it hard <endOfText>
<human> I have had way too many close calls on my finals. How did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in 5th grade and wanted a remote control car. My older brother who had a job said he would buy it for me if I got all A's on next report card. My lowest score was A- and he said that A- is not an A. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's pretty annoying. He should have given it to you anyway. A- is a great grade. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad I didn't get the job I had applied and interviewed for. I put so much work in crafting my resume to fit the description. <endOfText>
<human> That is very unfortunate that you put all that work in and were let down. I hope something good came out of it like another good job afterwards. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you know the feeling of having a vacation after long working months <endOfText>
<human> Yes! Theres nothing like the relief that comes with not having any assignments or projects due <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad!  All my boyfriend does is play video games 24/7! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's too bad! Have you told him how you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my four year old were grocery shopping. He was saying all sorts of cute things to people and being very polite. People were really amused by him it seemed. <endOfText>
<human> Kids are really cute at that age.  Embrace the cuteness while you still can! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not know if it is stupid to do but i handed my things to a stranger to look out for it <endOfText>
<human> What? why would you do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My experience is too much happier when i am surprise <endOfText>
<human> You like being surprised? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about my surgery next week. I have never had to get surgery before! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I have only had surgery once I was really scared but it was okay I was knocked out so didn't know what was happening  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I have only had surgery once I was really scared but it was okay I was knocked out so didn't know what was happening <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I will be under as well but I am still concerned something will go wrong. I think I watch too many scary movies! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I started in college, I really wanted to get my foot in the door with girls so I decided to download Tinder and it worked out surprisingly well. <endOfText>
<human> That is really cool. Did you find a girl you really liked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent months practicing for a major symphony in New York. All that hard work really paid off. <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear! How did it pay off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going for a competition tomorrow. I will surely be the winner <endOfText>
<human> What type of competition is it?  Im curious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is  a singing competition. It was going to be fun how i will become the winner <endOfText>
<human> Wow how interesting!  I really hope you do well.  I am sure you will! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was over the moon when I passed my classes last semester. <endOfText>
<human> Happy for you. Which course are you taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As bad as it is to say, one time I took a flash drive that I saw in a computer that I used at school because I needed one and it had nothing on it. <endOfText>
<human> That's interesting. At least you got some new storage space! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see a newborn baby I always think about how I wish their life will be happy and long. <endOfText>
<human> That is really sweet, I saw someone tweet about a baby laughing on the beach for 15 minutes today. Happy babies are fun  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is really sweet, I saw someone tweet about a baby laughing on the beach for 15 minutes today. Happy babies are fun <endOfText>
<human> Yes those laughing babies will always bring you a smile. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes babies are so cute but I like being able to send them home with their parents <endOfText>
<human> That is true. I enjoy my nephews for a few hours and then I go home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A month ago I had to move out of my house with only 2 weeks notice. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That must have been hectic. Did you have a lot of stuff? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked very hard on my part on the assigned project and my supervisor praised me yesterday in front of others in the meeting <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! I am sure you deserved it since you put so much effort in the project. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am such a sugar addict. I ate most of my kids' Halloween candies. I blamed it on their friends instead. <endOfText>
<human> That is amusing to hear. I hope your kids did not cry for their candies <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for next weekend.  I am going to Disney World here in Florida. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds super fun, I love florida and orlando its quite awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left the light on in my car the other day and it killed the battery <endOfText>
<human> That happens to me all the time because I drive a large van with a lot of extras.  It is such a pain! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently interviewed a job, but then the company threw a wrench in my plans. <endOfText>
<human> Oh damn, that's not good. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How believable do you think this is when you run into your old school mate outside the country <endOfText>
<human> i think that would be very unbelievable to run into someone out the country especially from school. Has that ever happened to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Of course yes, that is what i just said happened to me. It really caught me unaware <endOfText>
<human> wow that is awesome where you good friends with them or you just saw them in the halls alot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I went to the beach the other evening to celebrate our six year anniversary. It was secluded and looked gorgeous. He proposed to me and I was soooo elated. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thats amazing! How did ya'll initially meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We met in high school when he moved in with a friend that was my neighbor. We became friends just goofing around on the bus and then we got jobs at a neighborhood diner together and messaging each other every night and then eventually we just started spending every single evening with each other since. <endOfText>
<human> High school sweethearts, that's so special. Do you ever regret committing yourself to one person so soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No not at all, I feel so so lucky that I met him so young. I've grown up so much and become such a better person because he motivates me to do so, and I am so lucky to get every year I can to spend with him. <endOfText>
<human> Your outlook on love is really refreshing. I wish you two the best with your new futures. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can people be stupid enough to step on your toes without apologizing <endOfText>
<human> That is a disgrace. Some people just do not get it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like punching him in the face. He was so rude and stupid <endOfText>
<human> That is understandable. When did this incident occur? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, my friend has it so good in some regards. I have never been able to afford a car and he has had three free cars already. <endOfText>
<human> Free? How on earth do you get free cars? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother is trying to get a good job and we are praying she gets it. <endOfText>
<human> Damn, hopefully she gets it then. Why is she looking for a new one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother is looking for a better job, since not only are her two current jobs really bad but we also need more household income. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow im the same, i hope she gets it, its really stressful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter scored the winning goal at her last soccer game. I was so happy that all her hard work paid off! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Does she practice a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really hungry yesterday and opened the fridge and happened to have all the ingredients to my favorite sandwich. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were thrilled. There's nothing like a hearty sandwich to conquer one's hunger! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ignored my friends message on one of my social media sites that just wanted support from me after finding out her mom had cancer. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate to hear. It seems like everyone lost that day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous.  I have to take a really important exam next week. <endOfText>
<human> what is your exam on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an emergency and needed cash. I am glad that that my friend agreed to lend me <endOfText>
<human> I've been in the same predicament. My lease was coming up and I needed a deposit for a new apartment and my friend was able to help me out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My holiday trip has cancelled. I was feeling low for it. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad news and hard to deal with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While camping alone, I awoke to sound of growling outside my tent. It sounded like a big old mean wolf who wanted to eat me. <endOfText>
<human> oh no! did you go out and examine what it is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to clean out my son's closet yesterday. I found a box of old newborn sized clothes, some I had forgotten about and it totally sent me down memory lane. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a mixed bag of emotions. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drank some of my mother's rum a few years back and I still feel bad about it, especially since she found out and scolded me for it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That stuff is no good, did you have fun or was it more of a mistake? Haha.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! That stuff is no good, did you have fun or was it more of a mistake? Haha. <endOfText>
<human> I had fun, but at the same time stealing it from my mom was not my best moment haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is growing so fast. She cleaned the house before i get home yesteday <endOfText>
<human> That's great. My mom had three boys, so I'll be lucky to have a daughter. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you do house chores as young boys <endOfText>
<human> It was more shared with the whole family. But later my dad hired a maid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked to see that I passed my history class with so little effort and studying <endOfText>
<human> You must be really good with reading comprehension and remembering facts. Congratulations. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really annoyed today.  I walked outside to get something from my car and a friend was just hanging out in my driveway with some people I didn't even know. <endOfText>
<human> This is how you deal with such people,put him off. Reprimand such bad behaviors. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think everyday how fortunate I am to have a house, car, food, water and air to breathe. There are so many people in the world who don't even have clean water to drink <endOfText>
<human> You are so right. Even some of the worst conditions in my home country are better than most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Late last night I swore I heard some footsteps coming from my kitchen. I live alone and was convinced someone was in the house. <endOfText>
<human> It could've been a ghost or maybe a robber? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I go for a run every morning through these woods by my house and I ran right by a deer without realizing it. <endOfText>
<human> That's great exercise. Are you a fan of sports? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last semester, I was mortified about the fact that I had to go in front of the class and present about net neutrality. It went super well though. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you mortified? I don't know too much about net neutrality. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish i was held accountable for the office since i committed it. But my coworker was and i am depressed about it <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Have you talked with your coworker or boss about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was reading the news the other day and I saw something so sad, about some Christians being persecuted in Nigeria. I guess something like 6,000 families have been massacred by extremists. It made me feel awful and sick. <endOfText>
<human> The news can be so sad. That is horrible that that occurred! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it made me feel really terrible, I wanted to do something to help but all I could do is spread the news and encourage people to pray. <endOfText>
<human> People need to step up and start helping others. I will pray too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm awaiting eagerly to meet my friend. She is coming to my home. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, i recently reconnected with my friend, its really awesome when it happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last one of my wife's favorite cookies. <endOfText>
<human> hahah yea i have done that more than once. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is a wicked act for a mother to spank her son and he fell on his face <endOfText>
<human> Was it someone you saw in public? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sincererity is key to frendship <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely, i can't imagine being betrayed by a friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so glad when I got my first computer. I had been asking my parents for years and finally got my very own. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I just built my first computer actually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my husband.  He just got a huge promotion at his work this week! <endOfText>
<human> Wow getting a promotion is always an awesome thing. You guys must be so happy! Will you guys be celebrating this success? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One night when I was crossing a road, a car didn't see me and almost hit me! I was so scared. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens.  I wish more people would be more cautious when they drive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought my friend would never find a girlfriend, but he really proved me wrong recently and it makes me pretty proud. <endOfText>
<human> That is greta. Is she really nice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot forget my 25th birthday even if I tried. What an AWESOME day it was! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds crazy! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had never had tea thinking it was going to be awful but I recently had some and liked it a lot. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure that was quite a delightful experience, especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it. Was it regular tea or flavored?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure that was quite a delightful experience, especially since you were not expecting to enjoy it. Was it regular tea or flavored? <endOfText>
<human> Just regular green tea. It was iced and not hot though, since it's the summer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I give my neighbor my house key so that i do not lose it. Can you do that as well? <endOfText>
<human> No I don't know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I don't know my neighbor that well but my best friend lives close so she has my spare key <endOfText>
<human> That is good. Do you think it can be wrong for me to do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I became a great cook. I learnt lot of dishes <endOfText>
<human> Nice, like which ones to be specific? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was once a little scared that I was gonna die since I was in the passenger seat with someone who was very high driving the car. I didn't know a whole lot about drugs at the time. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you made it out alive. I wonder what drugs they were on. Some drugs actually make you more careful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wonder how my ex got such a pretty girlfriend. He doesn't look that great. <endOfText>
<human> Damn, what would you rate both of them? I know it might be a little childish but it helps me picture it haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am become so angry and bitter. My brother is having it all while i am at a spot without making any progress <endOfText>
<human> That's really tough. I can imagine how frustrated you are. Just know that going through trials and struggling is always good for your character and you will end up that much better of a person for getting through it. You can't be too concerned with other's lives, you just have to try not to compare.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying my best, but he lives so close to me and i can see all the progress and my mother do the comparison too. Everyone does it <endOfText>
<human> Oh well that's too bad but their behavior is not right or fair, and they will deal with the consequences of that themselves. Forgiving them is good for you and for them. Just try your best to let go, I know it's tough- but people everywhere are way more successful then you and way less successful and you don't compare yourself to them I hope so why focus on one random guy just because he's your brother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really tough. I can imagine how frustrated you are. Just know that going through trials and struggling is always good for your character and you will end up that much better of a person for getting through it. You can't be too concerned with other's lives, you just have to try not to compare. <endOfText>
<human> I am trying my best, but he lives so close to me and i can see all the progress and my mother do the comparison too. Everyone does it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting my email hacked and wanted to lose my temper and send the hacker insulting, threatening emails. I felt compelled instead, by my faith, to remain patient. I ended up getting my email back in the end! <endOfText>
<human> That is good. You finally conquer it all with your patient.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it might not be good to assume that but I couldn't help but feel that things worked out because I managed to keep my faith/patience that the situation would be okay. <endOfText>
<human> I will advice though, in some cases you have to report this to the security agencies  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is good. You finally conquer it all with your patient. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it might not be good to assume that but I couldn't help but feel that things worked out because I managed to keep my faith/patience that the situation would be okay.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will advice though, in some cases you have to report this to the security agencies <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, we are planning on reporting the hacker to the people that handle international fraud/scams.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt destroyed when I failed one of my college courses last year <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Was it a difficult course? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend that I know since I am kid. He is always there for me. He is one of the few person that I can trust for anything. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, childhood friends are so important and treasured <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew hit the ball really far in his baseball game the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Good for him! Sounds like he's a real slugger! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When shopping, I found a pants that I liked, but my partner insisted on getting different one. We argued and people were staring at us <endOfText>
<human> Don't you pick out your own clothes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am counting the days until I go on vacation. I can't wait! I am going to Europe for a month. <endOfText>
<human> wow that is awesome are you staying at a friends house?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow that is awesome are you staying at a friends house? <endOfText>
<human> No.  I am staying at a hotel in Rome.  I don't know anyone there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow are you looking forward to seeing the coliseum ? <endOfText>
<human> Yes!  I can't wait <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will  make it in the exam <endOfText>
<human> which exam are you taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 2 nephews were eating ice cream and the younger one dropped his in the dirt. The older one gave his own ice cream to the younger one. <endOfText>
<human> Awwww.  That is so sweet.  It is nice to see when young people are actually being nice to each other! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my son. He just graduated college last month! <endOfText>
<human> That is outstanding news. You must be a great parent to raise a son who got through college. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In freshman year of college, me and some friends got invited to this really sketchy party and we were really hesitant about going. <endOfText>
<human> Interesting, sounds like a metal band concert I went to where people were a bit goth. Did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew that there is a lot of studying entailed when you are in law school. I was up all night studying for the Bar. <endOfText>
<human> Law seems difficult it seems.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know, it is more tedious than it is difficult because you have to do a lot of reading and memorizing. I cannot remember not going a day without studying. <endOfText>
<human> You should  also have a sharp memory to remember, what ever you have studied.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so chuffed to see Croatia in this year Football world cup <endOfText>
<human> You seem to be an avid soccer fan. Is Croatia your favorite team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out walking with the kids yesterday and these loose dogs who are always running around the neighborhood came up and ran up to attack us. I was so scared that they were going to bite one of the kids, I just stomped at them and yelled loudly and luckily they were scared off and left. <endOfText>
<human> That is really brave of you, thanks for doing something about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh thanks, I just didn't want them to bite my kids! They had bit my ankle once before and even though they weren't huge dogs it really hurt. <endOfText>
<human> Yea and it can be bad for infections too, scary stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't expect my wife to buy me a new car for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! that must have been the best surprise for a birthday. You are so loved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week someone broke in my house and robbed us. Now I am scared to even live here! <endOfText>
<human> That's intense. I am sorry to hear that but stay positive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was so creepy when I saw a black cat following me on my walk. I was scared it was a shapeshifter. <endOfText>
<human> Like from harry potter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I once had to go camping it didn't have the right equipment. So I went to the store and bought a new tent and sleeping bag. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a fun trip. I love camping. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray not to be afraid to pass my exams <endOfText>
<human> I think you will be fine. Just stay confident! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I made plans with a friend of mine I had not seen in a long time. But on the morning of the day, my friend said they couldn't make it! I was so really mad. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens.  It makes you wonder if they are really your friend or not. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take care of my 3 year old, he had the flu. I fed him some healthy food, gave him a warm bath and tucked him in to bed with fresh clean jammies. It was sweet. <endOfText>
<human> wow. what an experience. He must have felt loved from the care you gave him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend cut my hair, with no training <endOfText>
<human> How did that wind up going for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live by myself and I get so bored. I feel so depressed. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that it bothers you in a negative way. I love being alone, I'm an introvert. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I grew these beautiful flowers in my garden and I had them for three years tending to them carefully. Can you believe our new landscaper mowed them over with his lawn mower. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible! You should fire that landscaper and plant new flowers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been doing work in a remote location and I haven't seen my friends or family for weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, that must be very lonely. Don't you get home sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied college at university of south Florida.  I was very happy when I graduated. <endOfText>
<human> Oh,congrats!thats great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My trust for people has no limit <endOfText>
<human> that is good right? that means you give everyone a chance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I throw boomerangs at the beach and I'm the only one I have ever seen do that. <endOfText>
<human> what was the reaction of the people around you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the particular time when I was a madly raging, that I smashed a 40oz beer on the street floor scattering all glass pieces over. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you wore shoes on the street for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aye. I did it because I lost a $500 bet. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so elated!  I got the job of my dreams today! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun. What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 9 years old I once stole my friends baseball cards and I still to this day feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my!  I hope you learned your lesson and never stole from a friend again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can someone brush your car without waiting to appologize <endOfText>
<human> ooh,  sorry about that. That is so rude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wish i can locate him and make him pay for what he did. but i will prefer to brush his face with a punch <endOfText>
<human> Please do not do that. just forgive him and hope that it does not happen again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "For my 30th birthday my friends threw me an unexpected party that was a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<human> Woo,i wish i was there,congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never know my girl friend is so noticed in the society until she won the most beautiful girl in her city <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. so she's kind of famous it seems <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when people are unfaithful to there relationship <endOfText>
<human> Did your girlfriend cheat on you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did your girlfriend cheat on you? <endOfText>
<human> yes a long time ago she did <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a wild or ferril cat that hung around my house for months. I fed him and took hi to the vet to be neutered. Instead of releasing him, I kept him. <endOfText>
<human> Now, that is what happens when you are a cat lover. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a baby last month. My husband and I were planning to spend the first few weeks alone just settling in but our grandmother from out of state surprised us at the hospital planning to stay with us to help out. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulation for the baby. Is a good or bad suprise that our grandmother is coming? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a coworker always disturbing me during working to talk to me about subject that I am not interesting in. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's frustrating, have you told them how you felt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting for a gift my girlfriend sent to me from overseas. I just want to see what i got <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's awesome. You feeling nervous about that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> of course yes. I know it must be something big. She is such a good giver <endOfText>
<human> What if it's opposite?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No it cannot be. She will not send something bad over a long distance <endOfText>
<human> You never know these days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that's awesome. You feeling nervous about that? <endOfText>
<human> of course yes. I know it must be something big. She is such a good giver  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What if it's opposite? <endOfText>
<human> No it cannot be. She will not send something bad over a long distance  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't feel great one time when I showed up at court drunk. I was ashamed of myself <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, what was the judge's reaction to that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so stress. Tomorrow, I will have my final exams. <endOfText>
<human> Awww, you need to take a nap,  for you to focus and read  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww, you need to take a nap,  for you to focus and read <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I know. I need to relax but I can't. I am so afraid to fail even if I am well prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year in my first year of college my roommate left so i had little human contact the entire year <endOfText>
<human> How convenient that was! My daughter would love that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin was telling me about the family all heading out for the annual family lake trip. I was feeling so envious because I can't go this time. <endOfText>
<human> ooh, sorry about that, why cant you join the <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been having a good relationship with my mom for a few years now so I'm not really "welcome". <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that. Why dont you try to make things work with your mother's relationnship <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ye, peole are so greedy of what they dont have <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it's true....  What happened??  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it's true....  What happened?? <endOfText>
<human> Some people can kill just because of greed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i lost my money I felt lost <endOfText>
<human> I surely feel your pain. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a scholarship last year that he was barely able to get, it was quite a large amount of money. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. What scholarship? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is correct. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry,  what is correct <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> By mistake, my wife during dinner yesterday said to your friend that we hiking the same day that we were suppose to go with them visit a city. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, how did they react to that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so apprehensive to check my mail today, but my heart erupted when I realized that I had 5 acceptance letters to medical school! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must be very brilliant <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost 40 pounds by eating right and going to the gym. Some people were surprised at my results. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What type of foods did you mostly eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I ate anything I wanted, but when I made a change, I threw out all pasta and sweets. I ate only chicken salad and green beans. <endOfText>
<human> Those sound like much healthier choices. Congratulations! How long did it take to achieve your goal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i worked for two months and expected nothing, but i wasn't disturbed, i had passion for what i was doing <endOfText>
<human> I wonder what was the work you were doing so passionately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Making clothes for a company <endOfText>
<human> That's interesting. You must be very talented <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the announcement for fallout 76 last month and was shocked and sad to see it wasnt an rpg singleplayer game. <endOfText>
<human> Really,i missed that. tell me more! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Like getting my report ready <endOfText>
<human> What's your report on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not happy when the car pissed on my new rug. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. can you wash it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really confident one time that I was not the one that lost my mom's glasses to the point that we argued about it all day, but then I remembered that I knew exactly where they were... <endOfText>
<human> Where were they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day my cat vomited on my best shoes and it really made me mad. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that cat must have loved that shoe, he wanted it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really didn't have much faith in my friend when he wanted to get a better ACT score, especially since he started out with a 22. <endOfText>
<human> Has he put in a lot of effort in studying and trying to improve? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I built a sandcastle which looked just like the Parthenon and it took me less than 20 minutes <endOfText>
<human> No way that sounds pretty extreme, did you really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a 4th of july music festival and a mother had her 6 year old daughter dressed in a leotard and paraded her around, it was horrible behavior for a parent <endOfText>
<human> Hahahaha, what was she thinking?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hahahaha, what was she thinking? <endOfText>
<human> A lot of those people are trashy or druggies, really sickening to be around <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can you believe that my friend who joined the firm I work for got a promotion that I was competing for. She get's a very big bonus and a company car. <endOfText>
<human> She may have done something else to "earn" that promotion, if you know what I mean ;) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had this girlfriend only a few months ago and she was always so honest and kind, it really made me trust her and care about her. Things didn't work out but that's okay. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. At least you enjoyed your time with her in the moment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The past few months have been going quite well, im happy with how things have gone <endOfText>
<human> good to hear that, what is interesting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Atimes they do it on purpose <endOfText>
<human> do what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother used to be so much more overweight than he is now, since he has been putting a lot of effort into losing weight recently. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear! What sort of things has he changed or started doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever tried weed? I did over in Amsterdam and man I was so nervous to try it! <endOfText>
<human> I tried it when I was a student. It wasn't my cup of tea. How did you find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How was life when you were growing up? <endOfText>
<human> It was pretty great but it was rough at times. You? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am stressed. My wife is expecting a baby. I am happy but at the same time I feel littlle stresse by the responsibilities. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I know how you feel. Not exactly the same situation, though. I was going through with an adoption, but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I know how you feel. Not exactly the same situation, though. I was going through with an adoption, but same amount of responsibilities nonetheless. <endOfText>
<human> Did it go away after the adoption happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the time when my grandfather died and resulted in a family feud. It made my life quite alone. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. What was the dispute about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a package and had to stay home to sign for it and the mailman drove past my house and didn't deliver it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, did he forget your address? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hi, my friend,i have a request for you,please don't tell lie to me,if i found you were telling lie to me,it hurts me more and i am furious <endOfText>
<human> Lies are never a good thing in a relationship. Have you had a friend who was lying to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not believe my eyes this morning. I saw my neighbor who loves to send us cupcakes pick his nose and put his finger that he just put inside his nose into his mouth! <endOfText>
<human> this is so funny.i didn't hear it anywhere. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once won an award for writing a poem in a competition I didn't enter. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, cool how did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting a baby last month. I had everything prepped and ready to go- clean house, stocked fridge, packed bag and more, <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's very resourceful of you. Did everything go as expected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am curios to undersand the the i dont know <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I don't understand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met this girl at a party one time and I totally thought she was into me, though I had no reason to really think so. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Why is that? Seems like you were aware of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super ticked off when my cat peed on the carpet. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when my cat used to do that. Would this happen often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Boy, that movie The Conjuring sure was good. <endOfText>
<human> I've not seen the movie <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, if you are a horror movie buff, you should. It has been long time since I was this scared. <endOfText>
<human> Hahaha I really love to see horror movies, but I don't usually get scared <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its good to appreciate people who have helped u in the past <endOfText>
<human> Very true. Who has helped you out recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone tried to steal my computer a year ago, got super angry with them. <endOfText>
<human> k then what u do that time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have a family? <endOfText>
<human> A mother, father and a brother. You? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my engineering diploma three month ago. I have been looking for a job since then. I finaly found a job that I am satisfied with but it is not the job that I dreamed of after getting my diploma. <endOfText>
<human> What engineering type did you graduate in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Playing with the new NES remake has me remembering all these games I had forgotten. <endOfText>
<human> That it is cool. There was an old game that I loved Crash Bandicoot. Recently, they did a remaster of this game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends are late to plans all the time. <endOfText>
<human> That must be really annoying! What were they late to this time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They cannot leave power because of greed <endOfText>
<human> Greed consumes all. By the way who are you implying about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find it frustrating when jealousy kicks in. <endOfText>
<human> Jealousy is the root of hatred,too bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i won my 4th grade spelling bee i was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I never won, but I got close! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, it's not easy finding good online work. <endOfText>
<human> Tell me about it. How long have you been job hunting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I do have a physical job. But bills are really eating me up, and I'm currently on vacation so I don't get paid as much off overtime. <endOfText>
<human> Did you travel anywhere for your vacation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was walking to lunch at school and it was really icy so I accidentally slipped on the ice. I was so red in the face when they were looking at me get up haha. <endOfText>
<human> Awww, are you always shy??  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww, are you always shy?? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah definitely, at least most of the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a pen from my grandfather that reminds me of him whenever I use it. <endOfText>
<human> what does the pen symbolise <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It paid very well and in a field I love. <endOfText>
<human> What field is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends set me up a huge surprise party for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats great. Were you delighted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel nervous in a crowd. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good. Do you find yourself in that situation frequently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in 2011 I was shocked to see how much it snowed, it was over a foot! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that must be very terrifying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As much as I wanted to keep my A in computer science back in freshman year, it didn't work out and I got a B. <endOfText>
<human> That's not too bad. Computer science isn't easy by any standards. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had gotten a random call from a girl I hadn't talked to since high school.  Turned out she was in my neck of the woods and wanted to catch up. So I threw on some fresh khakis and air nikes and 2 condoms just in case. Turned out it's always better safe than sorry. <endOfText>
<human> That is true, but why the air nikes? Haven't you heard about their effect on women? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The day of one of the most important meetings of my life and my nanny decides to come in an hour late and was not even a tad remorseful! <endOfText>
<human> Thats horrible. I mean if you have a job at least make the effort to get there on time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my girl friend once and haven't told her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, that is a very delicate situation. Do you plan on telling her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my mom have always had a trusting relationship. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear, it's always great to have a good relationship with your parents! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend really is stronger than he looks. I thought he would have issues curling 35 lbs but he did it pretty easily. <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! I wish I could lift that much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so old the other day when I heard an old song from one of my favorite kids songs. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, reminiscing can be nice sometimes though. What was the name of the song? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my sister stole money from me recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? That sucks, if they just asked people would usually be ok with it too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Their babies are treasures in their hands <endOfText>
<human> Babies are a treasure. Do you have any? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I refuse to go back into my neighbor's home. The last time I was there I saw ghosts all over that place. <endOfText>
<human> Does ghost really exist? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my son was born, that was the happiest moment in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats my friend. How old is he now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking into the early works of da Vinci. <endOfText>
<human> What works in particular?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The Caesarean womb section. I have to say, the genius and inventive mind of such a great individual is quite breataking. <endOfText>
<human> I agree wholly, quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What works in particular? <endOfText>
<human> The Caesarean womb section. I have to say, the genius and inventive mind of such a great individual is quite breataking.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree wholly, quite an impeccable spectrum. I read online on 4chan that da Vinci was likely an alien from the future. <endOfText>
<human> That's weird conclusion. But, Da Vinci does definitely hold secrets and died with them. He even might have created that very bizarre and undecipherable medieval book.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother has always had more friends than me and even though that made me happy for him, I couldn't help but wish I had as many as him. <endOfText>
<human> I was always jealous because my brothers didn't need to work as hard after I moved away. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so impressed by how a very unknown country in soccer like Croatia got to world cup final. <endOfText>
<human> They have done well - do you think they are unknown though? The were semi-finalists in 1998 and have had lots of good players over the years (Prosinecki, Suker, Boksic, Savicevic, Boban) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sent some stupid Whatsapp messages the other day <endOfText>
<human> I hope it is not too bad. You sent it to who? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will have to work in an important project, so i will not be able to travel next weekend <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Where were you supposed to be travelling to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its difficult for me to trust people at times. <endOfText>
<human> Why, have you have bad experiences? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have throughout my life and have found it difficult to be vulnerable. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That made us good children <endOfText>
<human> What made you good children? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just watched the testimony before Congress today. It was quite a show. <endOfText>
<human> Cool, whose testimony? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Heights really scare me and I don't know how to get over it. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried therapy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They stole some stuff <endOfText>
<human> What stuff?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What stuff? <endOfText>
<human> Gold,chains and other stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Slowly but surely the light at the end of tunnel is coming. <endOfText>
<human> Yes,its really coming <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyday I feel more optimistic that this country is heading into right direction into the tunnel. <endOfText>
<human> We,pray and have faith <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I just finished my first running race! <endOfText>
<human> Well done, you must be very proud of yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, I just woke up to some nice sunlight! <endOfText>
<human> Great, it hasn't got here yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the old times when there was so much less crimes. <endOfText>
<human> Do you honestly believe there were less crimes back then? Or were they just better concealed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lot of people think Tony Montana in Scarface was the bad guy...but I think he was really the epitome of hustling for the American Dream, even moreso than Rocky because though he got killed at the end he still left a fortune behind and stuck to his principle: never rely on anyone but yourself <endOfText>
<human> I understand. Do you like Tony Montana in the movie Scarface? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched the testimony of Peter Strzok earlier today before Congress. I think it's creepy more so even than vampire movies. <endOfText>
<human> Honestly,thats very true <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Such abhorrent arrogance and ungodly show on his part. <endOfText>
<human> Thats the way he is,can u imagine,so ungodly show <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> some people like to move away when they are older. I think I'm fine where I am. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, it's better to live in your own surroundings and have your own independence. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to be prepared when going on a trip. <endOfText>
<human> who doesn't? missing anything can ruin the whole trip. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I tend to go a bit too overboard and it can be a tad bit stressful. <endOfText>
<human> I think it's better to have too much than not enough though. right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a picture with my dad from when I was a baby. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, very interesting, how did you see yourself then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really regret ever dating my last boyfirend. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. Relationships are hard. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> promises are very important. builds trust. Ultimatums should do the trick ;) <endOfText>
<human> I think I'll just change my number lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoy playing squash and I always feel confident when I am on court. <endOfText>
<human> Woow, are you really good in the court?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Woow, are you really good in the court? <endOfText>
<human> I think I am at my level. I generally win most of my matches. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My current employer has financial difficulties. It has layoff 25% of the employees. I started to look for another job. I am expecting to be part of the next layoff. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, that really sucks. What kind of industry do you work in?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ouch, that really sucks. What kind of industry do you work in? <endOfText>
<human> I am working in IT but the job market is not good now. It is better to anticipate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to make small talk at my new job's onboarding and the lady ignored me. <endOfText>
<human> That was rude. Maybe she didn't hear you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss hanging out with my friends all night. Those days are over. <endOfText>
<human> Why does that have to change now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday while walking on the street there was a man in the corner asking for money. <endOfText>
<human> I always give. You never know if it's Jesus in disguise to test your heart <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sweet words u know can calm nerves <endOfText>
<human> Sweet words like what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have kids? Mines are 3 4 and 13. I look at their baby photos a lot. <endOfText>
<human> Thats lovely,i pray i will have one <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a tip at work yeserday. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? How big was the tip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man has to be hardworking in order not to be angry <endOfText>
<human> Cox a poor man is automatically an Angry man <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a child and it was time for back to school, I felt cared for when my parents took my to the store to buy clothes for school <endOfText>
<human> Yes we should be grateful to our parents for how they took care of us <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son comes back tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is so exciting ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a test tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck. Get enough sleep. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when Roger Federer lost the 2018 Wimbledon quarters <endOfText>
<human> Is that Tennis?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is that Tennis? <endOfText>
<human> Thats correct. He lost to somebody he should have easily beat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This magazine just charged my credit card when I had cancel my subscription. <endOfText>
<human> Thats horrible, how could they get it wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get furious when I see politicians argue between themselves <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I know, they lose so much time instead of solving the important problems. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday sure was shocking moment to watch on C-SPAN. <endOfText>
<human> I haven't seen it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen it <endOfText>
<human> You should. I never thought that Strzok's dramatic show would spark the true evil during the testimony before Congress <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wooow that must really be interesting <endOfText>
<human> Watch out for MEMES everywhere today and during weekend. #Strzokwork Orange in reference to Clockwork Orange is the latest one <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you watch Masterchef? <endOfText>
<human> I have a few times, my mom is really into cooking shows, so I watched them a lot growing up, and still catch a few now and then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, Gordon can be pretty supportive too, and soft spoken, which is surprising. <endOfText>
<human> I know. He is rarely like that in Hell's Kitchen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend slapped because he saw me dkscussing with his fiancee <endOfText>
<human> some friend. Maybe he's insecure and thought you or her were flirting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away last week. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to attend summer classes but I couldn;t <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It felt bad to finish last in a race last week. <endOfText>
<human> Really bad...  Did you come last??  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really bad...  Did you come last?? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, even when  there were 500 people and I was younger than most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Reality TV really annoys me <endOfText>
<human> I don't think you are alone there! What do you find so irritating about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately it didn't work out so well <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wen I was in college and I cheated on a test I felt guilty <endOfText>
<human> Shame on you .Did you at least pass?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Shame on you .Did you at least pass? <endOfText>
<human> Yes I did passs <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm ready to live in a house. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds like fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'd rather work alone that in a group or with a partner. <endOfText>
<human> I absolutely feel the same way. It is a rare trait, but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I absolutely feel the same way. It is a rare trait, but there are few people who do better on tasks on their own than as group task. <endOfText>
<human> True. I dislike when other people don't do their job and makes everyone work harder. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't hardly wait for the outcome of Congressional inquiry into the Strzok testimony yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I have no idea what that is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Indeed. It would be interesting to watch for time to come. Criminal investigation coming to conclusion and what to do about Strzok and his thug evildoing. <endOfText>
<human> OH. If he is guilty I hope he gets what's coming to him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got all A's last semester. <endOfText>
<human> Well done. Did you study very hard for it or are you just very smart? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Guilt just comes over me at times. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry, why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter acts just like I did when I was 13 <endOfText>
<human> I guess children could have that tendency, how fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was content when I found out that I had passed a class in college <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt grossed out when i found out people eat bugs <endOfText>
<human> haha. Ye like its normal to them. Nasty <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel depressed. <endOfText>
<human> oh no why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I might have to live on my own without wife and child. That is, if she plans to kick me out of the house eventually. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I couldn't be without my kids. Maybe you should go to counseling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to consider myself a foodie. <endOfText>
<human> I consider myself a foodie now. Im skinny, but I love food <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love dogs as they are so caring. <endOfText>
<human> Me too.  They really are a man or womans best friend.  Do you have dogs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt alone when my friends left me <endOfText>
<human> Its really devastating. But what really happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was terrified when I saw a snake <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? When was this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so unreal in a 'wow' moment. <endOfText>
<human> is that good or bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good. It has been nearly a year since we have adopted a kid, and she grew up so much. <endOfText>
<human> OH wow. That's awesome. I want to adopt too. Maybe foster. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex is the worse when it comes to payments. <endOfText>
<human> Oh? What did he or she do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh? What did he or she do? <endOfText>
<human> He is supposed to bring 200 dollars by today and just text me to say he doesn't even have half. He does that all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What are the payments for? <endOfText>
<human> child support. glad I never count on him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, my friend. I just received my promotion results back and it turns out I was not selected - which is a colossal bummer. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Would you eat such meal? <endOfText>
<human> What meal do you speak of? Breakfast? Lunch? Dinner? Midnight snack? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was lunch and there was a big fly starring at me dead. Luckily I was attentive enough <endOfText>
<human> That is awful!!! What happened to the fly? Did you manage to shoo it away or end its poor, miserable life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad when the truck I wanted was sold <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is not cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt trusting when I wnet to the docts <endOfText>
<human> What happened there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They examined me and gave me prescription <endOfText>
<human> Are you doing okay? anything serioius? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My next birthday is going to be epic! <endOfText>
<human> that sounds like a lot of fun  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that sounds like a lot of fun <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I'm inviting all of my good friends on a cruise. no kids <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my dad passed away, it was just really sad. It happened so sudden that I was not prepared. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear about your loss. Sometimes its better for it to be sudden rather than wait 6 months for the cancer to destroy you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was anticipating when I applied to colleg <endOfText>
<human> When are you going to find out your acceptance?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When are you going to find out your acceptance? <endOfText>
<human> I already did, I was accepted! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Boy, I feel envious of my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Oh now why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She gets to work whenever she wants, and spends time with our daughter whenever she wants. I need to find a real job, and not the dead-end labor job that I'm currently stuck in. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy when my brother was born. Even if there is a huge age gap <endOfText>
<human> Wow, now you have a brother, that is good to know <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wish me luck! <endOfText>
<human> Hello my friend! I will gladly wish you all the luck in the world, if you would only tell me what I am wishing it for! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been in a situation where you had food on your face and you walked around for awhile without anyone telling you? This just happened to me yesterday and I was so embarrassed! <endOfText>
<human> Of  course I have, it's really hard  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Of  course I have, it's really hard <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I was mortified when the person told me about it - especially when we were talking for about 5 minutes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very impressed when my brother came home from college. He was more mature and looked like a grown up. <endOfText>
<human> college changes you. Sometimes for the worse. Glad to hear about your brother <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm worried about what could happen in the future with all these climate changes. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I agree it's a big concern. Do you live in an area of the world directly affected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, according to some people the place I live could be underwater in a few years if things continue like this. <endOfText>
<human> That's really scary! I'll try to keep spreading the word for people to be more eco-conscious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very unsure about my first day of high school. I was just not sure how it was going to go for me. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find myself of people with nice cars lately. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, do you like nice cars? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel quite satisfied with my life. I've seen everything and done everything what there is in life. <endOfText>
<human> You must be really happy, I bet you have a beautiful wife and lots of money in the bank :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Actually, we're not rich. But she is beautiful to me, yes. I just want to sit back and enjoy life in the countryside far away from cities that perpetuates the poverty. <endOfText>
<human> That is what matters, to have a supportive and lovely wife <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Loneliness is very bad, I miss my partner <endOfText>
<human> I understand. I have been lonely most of my life. But, it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I understand. I have been lonely most of my life. But, it gives it back and it makes up the loneliness part. <endOfText>
<human> Is there any chance for us to break free from loneliness? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a solution for that, but I wouldn't advocate you doing it. <endOfText>
<human> tell me about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After the hurricane last year my town was really damaged and it caused a lot of problems <endOfText>
<human> I can only imagine the destruction and how horrible it is to deal with that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in a very fulfilling relationship. My partner and I mesh so well together it brings me great joy! <endOfText>
<human> thats great, I feel there is someone out there for everyone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love when my kids are asleep <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Why is that? Because you don't have to deal with their antics while they're knocked out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever stubbed your toe before? I did this morning when I got out of the shower and it felt like my life flashed before my eyes. <endOfText>
<human> It is one the worst pains. You would think we'd keep our toes more protected <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, here I was home from work. My new husband and dad were remodeling tour trailor's bathroom. I went to change to help. A little green lizard was on my shirt. In an INSTANT this yucky thing JUMPED on my head. I screamed so bad my dad said "I think you better go check on your wife." <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so frightening! Was your husband helpful? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No! He just sat there laughing as I screamed for him to find that lizard. Reptiles are gross to me. <endOfText>
<human> I agree! I would have been screaming, too! (And I would have been annoyed at my husband for laughing!) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devastated when my aunt died alone. She had a heart attack and no one was there for her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry, how sad.  Do you wish you had been with her to say goodbye. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the mall yesterday, here in the small town where I moved las month,  when I met a school frien I hadn't seen in years. <endOfText>
<human> That is always nice. Were they excited to see you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you ever purhase gas for under $1? <endOfText>
<human> Never. I don't remember a time when it was that cheap anywhere in the world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have not had beer in a year since I promised my wife i wouldn't <endOfText>
<human> I don't even take beer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've bought everything that I need for the house: foods, ammos, and other essentials that would last me months to come. <endOfText>
<human> Wow you sound really prepared for something. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, for the event of collapse of the government. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is the end coming? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty anxious on my first day of work. It was like a new world I was entering. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine, and how did things go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe that my friends are travelling to Russia to watch the soccer World Cup final! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that has to be a bucket list item for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever spilled a bowl of cereal? I did today and I was absolutely so mad! I flew into a blinding rage and started flailing about so bad that I nearly killed myself! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, why did you involve your self in spilling a bowl of cereal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am  the  best  because I was the first in my class <endOfText>
<human> Cool.  guess now you can be president. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ave the worst internet service now <endOfText>
<human> Really <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son won a scholarship so I won't have to spend money on fees. I am grateful <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's nice,  he must be very intelligent  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that's nice,  he must be very intelligent <endOfText>
<human> Yes he is, I am also grateful for having such a wonderful wife that teaches and helps him after school <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww that's nice,  just take care of them <endOfText>
<human> Thanks alot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Happy Friday! Isn't it the worst just waiting for the work day to go by so you can get to your weekend? <endOfText>
<human> Happy Friday indeed! yes I can't wait to finish work for today even when i am just beginning. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday we went hiking to the mountain and I didn't tell a friend we were going even when I knew she likes to come with us. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Did your friend do something to upset you or something like that? Or were you just wanting some alone time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There isnt a better home cook in the world than myself. <endOfText>
<human> Really? What sort of cooking do you like to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a brand new coworker start at my job. I've loved helping him learn the ropes! <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Most people dont like training. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt surprised me for my 18th birthday. She showed up from out of state and really made my day. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of her. I like pulling surprises on people too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you usually take your trash out to the road every week? It is quite an awful experience, in my opinion. I feel very disgusted hauling that big ole bin to the road. <endOfText>
<human> I live in an apartment so I take mine out to the dumpster every few weeks. I feel your pain though. Growing up I had to take ours down our steep driveway every week. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a house fire last year that destroyed everything , it was very tough on my family <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that, it must have been heartbreaking. How did your family cope? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever since I started riding my motorcycle, traffic has been an interesting affair. Sometimes I think drivers are mad or confused at me, but they really just want to talk about the bike! <endOfText>
<human> I bet that is an experience you are still trying to get used to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was proud when my brother got his degree. He was the first in our family to do that so it was nice. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome. I wish everyone could go to college if they wanted <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Paying rent is starting to make me mad. <endOfText>
<human> Money issues are always hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an accident and my new car got bashed, i'm not happy about that :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope you are ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily insurance paid but my time was wasted <endOfText>
<human> Things happen we cant do anything about it, I hope this accidently wont affect you in the long term <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope it turned out that everything was OK <endOfText>
<human> Everything was in the end, but at first not so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ashamed when I got in trouble with the law. I was more ashamed of what my dad was going to think. <endOfText>
<human> It must have been embarrassing. Hope it ended well for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped my first day of high school in front of people. It was a tad bit embarrassing for me then and there. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did they react by laughing, helping, or ignoring? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finding out that I was pregnant really floored my husband and I both. <endOfText>
<human> News that big would be a shock to anyone! How did you both handle it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have children myself, but being a guardian for my dog is rewarding too. <endOfText>
<human> Most definitely!. Dogs are important members of a family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I ordered chinese after craving it forever, and it ended up being gross! Ugh. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is frustrating! I love Chinese food. What did you order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too! I was pretty bummed about it though. I ordered the general tso meal, and krab rangoons. <endOfText>
<human> Crab rangoon is one of my favorites. I would be bummed too. I think I know what I am having for dinner tonight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been to one of those paint parties where you bring your own wine? <endOfText>
<human> Yes! They are super fun. Have you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! They are super fun. Have you? <endOfText>
<human> Yes. I went to one last week. I was surprised at how good all of our paintings turned out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always am as well because I am not an artist by any means. <endOfText>
<human> I made some geat friends too. We are going to do it again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day my daughter got her 4th DTAP vaccine and she had a bad reaction to it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is everything okay now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, yesterday, I was very positively suprissed by the work done by a coworker. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good news! What did they do to surprise you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats good news! What did they do to surprise you? <endOfText>
<human> He is realised a full project on his own and have used all IT best pratices for this project in very short period of time. He is very skilled. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Weve been struggling lately, but my wife finally has an interview tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you struggling? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> because we are only on one income and its not enough for our family <endOfText>
<human> I understand. It is impossible to live with only one income for family. I am happy she have an interview. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was naive with the interest rate on my credit card and have let it get out of control, it is unsettling to me. <endOfText>
<human> Being in debt is so stressful and I'm sure that just adds to it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being in debt is so stressful and I'm sure that just adds to it. <endOfText>
<human> It does, and the worst of all is I'm scared to tell my partner about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My junior year of college starts in August. I am studying criminal justice. <endOfText>
<human> I would have loved to study criminal justice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, so I was driving down the street the other day, and this random car came flying out of nowhere from a side-street and almost hit me, I was quite angry. <endOfText>
<human> People drive more and more badly. Did you take the plate number? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I feel bad after my reaction to brother joke. Now, he is angry against me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's unfortunate, did you make fun of him or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend just got engaged the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh thats great news, Congratulate him on my behalf. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a pizza the other day and it was delicious. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds good just reading those words, what kind was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I bought a lottery ticket on a whim and won $250, talk about a lucky day! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Was it a scratcher or did you have to pick numbers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to child support court last month. What a waste. <endOfText>
<human> Wait. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I went on vacation to Mexico. There is very frequently electricty outage. It is bothering me a lot. <endOfText>
<human> OH no. I didn't have that problem in MExico <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is going to eigth grade this year and wants to try out for lacrosse <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I don't know this sport. What are the rules? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Working in another country for a year. Going to save up to marry my girlfriend <endOfText>
<human> I have always wanted to work abroad. What work are you doing there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so a couple weeks ago i went out partying with some friends and while we were drinking my friend went out to do drugs to feel better but since i was his bestfriend i didnt like to see him throw his life away like that and mentioned that we were already drinking he didnt need to get higher but he refused so i started yelling to chill out and he shoved me to the ground. i felt he chose the drugs over friends <endOfText>
<human> I can see why you feel that way. Sometimes addicts aren't in full control of their decisions, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah but there is always a time and a place and if i invite my bestfriend to have a good night and he decides to do his own thing it annoys me, as i hate seeing him like that and after that i felt the night was just ruined. <endOfText>
<human> I think you have a right to be mad over that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think you have a right to be mad over that. <endOfText>
<human> do know anything i can do to stop him  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my mom's for dinner two nights ago and she didn't even cook the chicken all the way through. I nearly threw up at the table. <endOfText>
<human> wow! i would have felt some type of way to. what did you do after  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow! i would have felt some type of way to. what did you do after <endOfText>
<human> I can't yell at her for it, she is getting up in age and is trying her best. I gently reminded her that chicken needs to be cooked to 165 degrees and if she doesn't have a meat tempature checker, I'd get one for her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just moved to a new city, new work, and I've got no friends. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried making any? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors always have company. People are constantly parking in fron of my apartent. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Is there a lot of parking available? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have kids? My daughter will be 14 soon. I don't want her to grow up. <endOfText>
<human> None that I know of!  I feel you.. if I ever had a daughter I'd be overprotective and stressing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want dry, breezy, and sunny weather the whole week dang it <endOfText>
<human> Where can you get that kind of weather. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend has alwas been there for me. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  It's good to have loyal friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm mad I only hit 335 on the bench today and not my regular 350...I need to start eating healthier <endOfText>
<human> That's important. There's always tomorrow though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the club yesterday and my brother left me. I knew he was coming back though. He just wanted a taco <endOfText>
<human> This happens many times, they just don't care of us <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was listening to this random music playlist on Youtube and then this song that I hadn't heard since I was a kid, that I had completely forgotten about, came on and brought back all these childhood memories. <endOfText>
<human> What was the song? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was this song by the band "Cake" that my parents used to play all of the time in the car. I can't remember the name though. <endOfText>
<human> Is it short skir't long jacket. I love that song. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything always reaks in my apartment and the maintenence team sucks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's so gross! Do you know what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My landlord has the same issue. <endOfText>
<human> I hope to move next year. Time for a house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pregnant and I went in to labor in the middle of the night unexpectedly. I didn't have reliable transportation and the taxi company was closed so I had to call a friend who I hadn't seen in a long time and luckily she was able to take me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds pretty stressful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was, I had a quick labor and I didn't have time to get an epidural once I got there. It was my least favorite birth of all of my kids, the next one was better though. <endOfText>
<human> Did he / she turn out fine without complications? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love that feeling of finishing a bomb workout at the gym...then catch 5 cute girls staring and shyly look away and their boyfriends giving me salty looks <endOfText>
<human> Wow is that really something that happens? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think I believe you. <endOfText>
<human> Haters gonna hate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran out of funds for college and they want me to get a private loan. <endOfText>
<human> Well, is that something you can do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think that's my only option now. <endOfText>
<human> Look carefully before you sign. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family has been very nice lately. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. Was it not like that before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother was coming back from a trip. I was expecting from him to bring to me a gift. <endOfText>
<human> He didn't bring you anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I was talking a walk the other day and I accidentally stepped in some dog poop, talk about gross. <endOfText>
<human> Ewww. I haven't done that in a while. Thankfully. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wake up to a dead cell phone every single morning. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's the worst, I try to remember to charge but it's hard to remember every time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store the other day with my husband.  A friend called my name and we went over to see them. <endOfText>
<human> What were you guys looking to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was born in the Philippines and living in America makes me value my heritage even more. <endOfText>
<human> That is interesting, what things do you do while living in America to keep your heritage alive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not the best cook but I'm gonna try to make a pizza today. I think its gonna be great. <endOfText>
<human> Just be careful not to burn it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely a lot in years past. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Sorry to hear that. IS it different now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally left my dog outside in the heat too long a week ago, I felt terrible. <endOfText>
<human> OH no. Were they okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have three kids and they are all into different things. <endOfText>
<human> Well that must be exciting to have so much variety, how old are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dreamed that I had taken in a family of cats. I might rescue  one now. <endOfText>
<human> Must've been a pretty vivid dream <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even though I grew up in a small house in a third world country the company of my family was worth more than diamonds <endOfText>
<human> Family is important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got robbed, while i was alone at home <endOfText>
<human> oh no, that must have been terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to the future a lot lately. <endOfText>
<human> well, we all do. I hope you achieve what you set out to do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss didn't accept my vacation plan. I made me unhappy for the day. <endOfText>
<human> That has to be disappointing. Can you change your plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin got married on a budget recently. I was wondering how it would turn out and it ended up being very stylish and nice looking. <endOfText>
<human> I think that's the way to go when it comes to a wedding. Use the money for your future as a couple, not for one day. But to each their own, so you were impressed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was working really hard for a marathon in a few weeks but I ended up breaking my ankle a little bit ago and can't participate. I'm disappointed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible. Can you walk maybe with some support at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made sure to do everything I needed before Hurricane Irma hit my area. I bought bottled water and non perishable foods, I also made sure I had enough gas for my grill as well. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get any damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered some chicken the other day and I had ate some before I realized it was still pink. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I would have been so disgusted! And mad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was both. I almost went to the hospital because i had gotten sick later, but it didn't last very long. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awful. I hope you filed a complaint with the restaurant!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds awful. I hope you filed a complaint with the restaurant! <endOfText>
<human> I surely did. I will never eat there again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I hear Christmas music during the holidays I miss my family in the Philippines <endOfText>
<human> awww, when are you planning to visit them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always been faithful as a husband, I pride myself on that. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, there is not a lot of people like you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone hit my car during the night. It made me very angry <endOfText>
<human> Did it do much damage to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, me and my friend got into fist fight <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, why were you fighting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my daughter roller skating for the first time recently and I was taken right back to my childhood. All I could think about was spending my Friday nights as a kid at the roller rink! <endOfText>
<human> wow nostalgic. Wish you had time machine.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been on a date in a while. I have one this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Do you know where you're going yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a dream the other night that my daughter got lost at school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That's a nightmare. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest daughter is starting middle school next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, is she nervous about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend from childhood moved for her job. She was my only friend and I'm pretty bummed out about it. <endOfText>
<human> How far away has she gone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband went to jail and I didn't know what was going to happen or how I would get him out. <endOfText>
<human> OH no. Is everything okay now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the worst neighbors. <endOfText>
<human> I hate that. It makes it really hard to want to go home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A car hit me about 10 years. I awoke up in the morning naked and two womens wasking me for chirurgical operation. I felt so bad to be naked in front of people I don't know. <endOfText>
<human> You weren't thinking about the surgery at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me ex is never on time with his child support payments. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. I hope you found a solution with him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw this guy playing an entire song by himself at a talent show, talk about skilled. <endOfText>
<human> What song / instrument was being played <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm 26 and can bench, squat, and deadlift over 300lbs...I feel pretty good about myself overall <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's pretty good, you must be a member of the thousand pound club? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my husband and I were teenagers we moved in to this cabin our friend offered us to live in free. It was like homemade and no one had lived in it for years. There was still food and dishes in the sink and fridge that we had to clean out, it made me vomit seriously there were maggots and stuff. <endOfText>
<human> Nice did you become sort of a nature girl after that experience? Or were you just traumatized haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, haha not traumatized but happy to move in to a real apartment once we had enough money saved, haha. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool.  So I'm guessing you're more of a city gal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like I'm the man every time I get a cute girl's number.  Makes me a little less hopeless after breaking up with my ex! <endOfText>
<human> That's sad, maybe you were meant to be with your ex though.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's sad, maybe you were meant to be with your ex though. <endOfText>
<human> Yup you're exactly right...moving on was hard but meeting someone new makes it way easier <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom will be moving in at the end of next month and I've been thinking about my childhood with her. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a nice one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been ordering out for the past two weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Is it too hot to cook or do you just hate cooking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I wrestled in high school I always expected the other guy to be way better...so I would give it everything I had <endOfText>
<human> That's a good strategy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY internet used to be awesome now it cuts out several times a day. <endOfText>
<human> Well at least you can find an excuse to step outside the house and mix it up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a mail yesterday! It was a surprise announcement for me! <endOfText>
<human> What was the announcement? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a promotion to the next level... I'll become a team lead from next month!!! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congratulations! I bet you worked hard for that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in a townhome community right now and my neighbor is moving to a single family home. She's lucky! <endOfText>
<human> I wish you'll also move soon. anyway I'm happy for your neighbor.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish you'll also move soon. anyway I'm happy for your neighbor. <endOfText>
<human> I am too but also a little envious. I'd like a yard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new laptop is amazing. I was really excited when I received it. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of laptop is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying to make my goals by the end of the year. <endOfText>
<human> what are you goals that you are planning? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my family is the perfect size now. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, how many people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got caught stealing food once when I was young and broke, traveling on a Greyhound. I felt awful about it. <endOfText>
<human> I was caught stealing once when I was younger. It was so embarassing, never did it again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is gonna go pick up a pizza for us. I am so hungry <endOfText>
<human> What kind of pizza? Now you're making me hungry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was proud when my toddler randomly said 'fries' out loud when he smelled them! Talking has been a process for him as he was born early with some problems. I was so proud that he was able to identify an object with its smell <endOfText>
<human> Cool. I still get excited when my kids say new words. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like it when people in customer service have attitudes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know what you mean! It is even worse when you ask for their manager and the manager gives you a major tude! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i had this friend he wasn't great at a Multiplayer game i used to play with him. <endOfText>
<human> What game was it? Did you give him tips? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my husband has been spending time with his old girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh snap! That is not a good thing to hear about. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "The birth of my nieces were some of the best times of my life. I have four <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  How old are they now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once got really mad when I was in the ring with this guy...he was about my skill level and landing some good blows and I saw his coach laughing in the corner...so I dug into my punches more, making his head snap back and forth til he was retreating for the rest of the round.  I felt pretty good after that <endOfText>
<human> Some people are just plain rude. I'll bet you really wanted to punch the coach. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> High School was a bad time for me. Was called names all the time but never physical stuff. <endOfText>
<human> As a fat guy who wore all black and played Magic: The Gathering everyday in the library, I can relate lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a child I was in a Hurricane while living in Florida. A tree fell on our house. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad! How are you doing now? Did your house get repaired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never knew pizza from the gas station could be so good. <endOfText>
<human> The only pizza I have ever had at the gas station was some pizza from 7/11. Where have you had it at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So everyone in my family knows I have a huge repulsion of expired food, anything even if people say its good I wont eat it. My little brother and my mom and I had a big dinner with mashed potatoes, and we all ate and after ward my brother tells me, mom used expired gravy!!! And you didn't notice! HA! I was really grossed out! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I opened an expired can a long time ago. I check everything twice now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was struggling in a class once and i didn't study for the midterm on the day of the test. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Sounds like a bad idea lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "Once for my birthday my sisters did not tell me anything about a party and I was completely caught off guard with what they had planned.". <endOfText>
<human> I've always wanted a surpirse party!! Were you happy that they surprised you in this way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> IT's almost time for schoo to start back! <endOfText>
<human> I know! I'm going school shopping tomorrow. Its tax free weekend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Music brings back so many memories. <endOfText>
<human> What about it brings back memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So you ever break something and blame the dog? <endOfText>
<human> Ha, many times. I once blamed my dog for breaking a friend's TV, but it was me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally ran into a glass wall once when I wasn't paying attention <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! That must of hurt even if it didn't break. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a great birthday this year. <endOfText>
<human> Did you do something really fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I wore my pants backwards to work <endOfText>
<human> How did you manage that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How did you manage that? <endOfText>
<human> They were pull on with no buttons or zippers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "there was a time when I lived in another state with no family around. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been really hard on you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an extra $5 an hour. I can't wait to buy a new boat. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. How long will it take to save up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A coworker of mine recently got a promotion that I also applied for. I worked hard on my application and resume and writing to get the promotion, and they got it not me. I am seriously not happy about i <endOfText>
<human> Have you followed up with your HR department to ask what was missing from your resume or experience that will help for next time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son's cardiologist gave us positive news. We have to start looking forward when it comes to him now. It's so exciting. <endOfText>
<human> That is great! Has he overcome an illness or heart issue? That can be serious and very scary! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i thought people missed my birthday one year. I was terribly mistaken 2 days later. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? did you get the best surprise of your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I paid for a certification exam and had a terrible accident that kept me bed ridden in the hospital I got out and realized I had just 5 days to my exam <endOfText>
<human> Those kind of exams are really important. Did you study before the accident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the hopital for like 3 weeks. I studied and work with the equipments everyday  but still I felt anxious when I got to the exam center because I didn't have enough time to revise <endOfText>
<human> Man that is just awful though that happened to you. What was the out come of the exam? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried really hard to make a good argument but I was scared. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that doesnt sound good! What all happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently learned that a close friend is getting foreclosed on their home. <endOfText>
<human> have they contacted the lender for a loan modification? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever have a little brother that just took your stuff without asking? <endOfText>
<human> Yes I grew up with 4 brothers and they always did it to me ..haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to stop after seeing a close friend die of lung cancer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is not good! I am sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first time someone gave me flowers made me feel so special <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine! Why did someone give you flowers?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can imagine! Why did someone give you flowers? <endOfText>
<human> It was for Valentines Day. But now if I get some it still has the same feeling attached to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of the happiest moments in my life was when my niece was born. She is amazing in every single way. <endOfText>
<human> These children hold a very special place in your heart. It's amazing that when this happens you never knew that you could love someone so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm ready to destroy my final today. <endOfText>
<human> Well that is good! What class is it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So you ever have a bad night with your friends and i am saying lots of drinking bad night. <endOfText>
<human> i've had hundreds. I know my toilet well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weatherman said that we would have a snow event so I was ready <endOfText>
<human> How did you prepare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad took me to a golf championship, the PGA that came to my home town last May. All the famous golfers you see on TV were there and I tripped down a hill in a dress! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didn't get hurt. Did people laugh at you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No luckily I wasn't hurt physically but my ego was! No one laughed about it until after, they were more concerned then anything, they were actually very nice! <endOfText>
<human> Was it caught on video? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You remember the first time you moved out of your parents? <endOfText>
<human> I sure do. I moved into a dump lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was supposed to be on her trip for months and months but she came home early! I missed her! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been a wonderful feeling! It must have been hard not having your friend around for awhile. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have applied to so many jobs lately. I have some super exciting news! <endOfText>
<human> What's the news? Do you have an interview? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure do! I can't wait to show off my strengths. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you're well prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was at a friends house and our kids were running around playing games. While chasing eachother my small child bumped into a vase that fell over and broke! My friend was so understanding but I still felt really bad! I helped clean it up with her. <endOfText>
<human> if they have kids I'm sure they understand. Sometimes you just can't have nice things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving and it began to rain so hard that I could see nothing in front of me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened to your wipers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my son decided to draw on the seats of my car with permanent marker! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. It's hard to get mad at them when there really isn't anything you can do about it now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very surprised by the performances of the French soccer Team in the world cup. I was expecting the Croatia soccer Team to win the final. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have a team that you were rooting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "While at my nieces kindergarten field day she figured out how to win the 3 legged race with a partner who could not run well. <endOfText>
<human> It is nice. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few days ago, I broke my weightlifting record at the gym. I felt so fulfilled! <endOfText>
<human> Had you been trying long to break it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started a new job recently and felt uneasy on the first day <endOfText>
<human> Well good work on getting the new job. I recently transitioned to a new job too recently. I'm in the same boat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was my birthday the other day, and I was allowed to leave work early by my boss! <endOfText>
<human> Dang! That's awesome! Did you get any cool presents? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, yesterday I opened up my lunchbox and I found out that the milk I packed was starting to curdle. I felt quite disheartened. <endOfText>
<human> oh, that stinks, was the milk expired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it must've been. It only had a day left or so, I believe. I was trying to be frugal! <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to save your meal and get some more milk or something else to drink? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my little toe. Never felt so much anguish and despair in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, you must have stubbed it pretty hard! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son and I just checked out a gym he wants to join. The owner has built a really nice business for himself. It was really cool. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty neat. It's always good to hear that people are getting fit to feel swell about themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I went to Starbucks and the line was so long. I waited 20 minutes for my drink! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What was taking so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been to a real life haunted house? I think mine is. <endOfText>
<human> No, I haven't been to a real haunted house before. I always go to fake ones around Halloween. Why do you think yours is haunted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone was checking out my girlfriend the other day when I went to the supermarket. I felt so enraged! <endOfText>
<human> People are only human. There is no harm in looking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my girlfriend to my school dance the other night. It was truly a magical experience! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Some of the best romantic experiences are at school dances. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking to adopt a dog and found one that I loved. By the time I was ready to adopt and get to the rescue shelter, somehow else had adopted the dog. <endOfText>
<human> Awwww, well that;s too bad. Hopefully the owner is as loving towards it as you would have been. What kind of dog was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my promotion results back the other day and I didn't get selected. I was so angry because I know I am a great employee. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that. Did you talk to your manager to understand why you did got selected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, my dog managed to perform a trick I have been trying to teach her for months. I was so proud that she did it! <endOfText>
<human> Dogs are so much fun. It is amazing how smart they are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "When my relationship ended it was very hard <endOfText>
<human> Breaking off a relationship is tough business. How long did it last for? Was it serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few days ago, I was coming home from work like any other ordinary day. When I walked in the house, my wife secretly organized a surprise party! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how exciting. Did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While driving someone backed up and almost hit me <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. That must have been nerve wrecking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> they were not paying attention. <endOfText>
<human> were they on the phone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Visited my old town, and it reminded me so much of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> That can be so much fun.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That can be so much fun. <endOfText>
<human> It was a lot of fun actually. Met up with some of my old buddines. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad because I ate all the chocolate in the kitchen. We were supposed to divise between me, my brother and my sisters. I can't control when it is about food <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same, man. I always tend to overeat whenever there is good food about. Did you do anything to make it up to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I had the chance to finally lay down in my bed and read a book after a long work week. It felt so good. <endOfText>
<human> It is nice to have some time to care of ourself. What book did you read? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I went out to my garden yesterday I noticed that bugs had eaten the dandelions in my garden. I was so upset about it that I cried. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. Did they get them all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I misspoke some words out in public and lots of people heard. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow, I guess you were embarrassed? It happens to us all though, so you just laugh it off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did laugh. Trouble is sometimes when I start laughing I can't stop. <endOfText>
<human> I do that too! Or laugh at the wrong time, so I understand! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In my last year of college I had a final exam that I was really scared of and worried about. I spent much of my time studying for it. When it finally came time to take it I felt good about it and was ready to take it on. <endOfText>
<human> You sounded very prepared. How do you feel about it? Think you passed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I had my final Physics exam and I think I nailed it, due to studying so hard. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great! It sounds like you really studied hard. I hope you did wonderful on it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my foot looked at recently by a doctor, boy was I nervous going into it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's annoying! I hate going to the doctor...freaks me out. I always feel like they're going to tell me I'll die in 5 weeks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have this coworker who really likes to pull pranks on people...again..and again. It's always the same stuff <endOfText>
<human> Oh that can be annoying sometimes, I hope they're not too serious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our county fair is coming up in a couple of weeks and I'm looking forward to going. <endOfText>
<human> I am supposed to be going to an amusement park with friends this weekend, hoping they have fair type rides there.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am supposed to be going to an amusement park with friends this weekend, hoping they have fair type rides there. <endOfText>
<human> I'd say that they will. In fact, I'd expect it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I won a big gift card yesterday which made me very happy! <endOfText>
<human> Well, how big was it, and where for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm always really amazed at how my children are wonderful. <endOfText>
<human> Are they just great in general or did they do something extra special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, i had a dinner with my close friend from high school. I was very glad to finally meet him after 7 years <endOfText>
<human> that sounds like fun, how long do you know each other? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the Disneyland again this year, it was awesome <endOfText>
<human> To be honest, i have never visited it yet. But I am very eager to go there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved out of my beach community in Los Angeles because it was so expensive, I don't know how my remaining friends there exist! <endOfText>
<human> Theyre clearly fatcats, thats how. Where did you move to?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> New Orleans. It's a fun city but it's not as nice as California. One of my friends in LA is just a teacher and goes to Hawaii all the time. I've never been. <endOfText>
<human> isnt california like really hot? Im not sure if id be able to tolerate the temperature to be honest, do you intend to move back to los angeles in the future? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's nice at the beach, like 85 degrees. A cold day is 55, which are rare. I'd like to move back but can't ever imagine paying 2400 for renting a box. <endOfText>
<human> i pay 160 euros a month for my apartament lol, 2400 is insanity tbh. and 85 degrees is like 30c D: that is so hot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha, it feels perfect to me.  Your rent sounds affordable, I'll bet you have healthcare, too. <endOfText>
<human> i actually dont, my country decided to illegally deny it to me, but most people do. you could move to EU if you really wanted to, rent sure would be way more afforadable regardless of which country you pick <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Theyre clearly fatcats, thats how. Where did you move to? <endOfText>
<human> New Orleans. It's a fun city but it's not as nice as California. One of my friends in LA is just a teacher and goes to Hawaii all the time. I've never been.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife lost her phone, its a new one <endOfText>
<human> What kind of phone was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congratulations! You deserve it! <endOfText>
<human> /Am not sure, what i deserve <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had plans to go out with friends the other night and then my mom called me to tell me she was having all our family over for dinner and I was expected to be there. I told her about my plans and she said to change my plans. She does not understand. <endOfText>
<human> So, did you go to her dinner, or do what you had planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a wreck in front of my house yesterday morning early. <endOfText>
<human> Was everyone okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my friend a few days ago, and it made me feel really bad <endOfText>
<human> Was it about something serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I seem to be mowing the lawn more frequently this year. <endOfText>
<human> Has it rained more often there than usual? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 'friends' left me out of their social plans yesterday which wasn't very fun for me <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask them why?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you ask them why? <endOfText>
<human> No, but I think it's because we had a major argument and they all took the other person's side <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to go on vacation next. Getting ready to make reservations online. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds fun! What area did you have in mind, since you're already about to make the reservations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother stole my wife's jewelry while she was in the hospital. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a nice steal or a mean one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hey. i took my son to the park yesterday and he was going down the slide and i didn't catch him. he fell and hit his face , i feel so bad about it <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate to hear that he is hurt. But you shouldn't feel bad. It happens all the time. Kids will find a thousand ways to get hurt.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> tell me about it :) he keeps bumping his head, scraping his knees. such a busy body! <endOfText>
<human> My daughter is the same way! She gets bumped and scraped way more than my son, but she just goes right on. How is your son today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I hate to hear that he is hurt. But you shouldn't feel bad. It happens all the time. Kids will find a thousand ways to get hurt. <endOfText>
<human> tell me about it :) he keeps bumping his head, scraping his knees. such a busy body!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend moved away last year. A couple weeks ago she came to town and she and her son stayed with me and my family for 9 days. She left 3 days ago and I feel like a piece of me is missing. <endOfText>
<human> i know how you feel... My best friend lives in a different country <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever replay a video game or re-watch a movie you really enjoyed as a kid? The memories of your initial experience can really come rushing back. <endOfText>
<human> I do that all the time. I can remember lots of times watching things from long ago. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm upset these days that both of my parents have dementia now and most of the time don't even know who I am. Makes me feel very alone. <endOfText>
<human> That must be very hard on you, I'm sorry to hear that. It must be very scary to experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took classes this summer and passed all of them. <endOfText>
<human> Woo hoo! Congratulations! You must be super proud of yourse.f <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was basic college math. <endOfText>
<human> Oh okay. I bet psychology was an interesting course. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Which math class did you take? <endOfText>
<human> it was basic college math.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my kids are on my nerves so much today. They are not behaving at all, and are making it impossible for me to get any work done. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it does. They are bored, I'm sure. But I can't take them anywhere until later. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today my spouse had an interview, and said it went very well! <endOfText>
<human> awesome! My husband had an interview as well. I hope both of our spouses get a job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is amazing! I bet they will both get it for sure! :) Fingers Crossed. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so! My husband was so nervous but he thinks it went well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my birthday and my friends sent me birthday cards in the mail. I received all of them but not the one who contained a gift card. i'm so angry about it <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, oh no.... is there someway you can have the person who sent it call the gift card to see what can be done?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh, oh no.... is there someway you can have the person who sent it call the gift card to see what can be done? <endOfText>
<human> I don't want to bother her about it. but i did call usps and they will investigate it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was told I am being taken on a trip to the beach as a gift... pretty exciting. <endOfText>

<human> Wow... I would have been as well! Was anyone injured?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow... I would have been as well! Was anyone injured? <endOfText>
<human> I don't think so, but the deer is dead for sure. <endOfText>

<human> Thats great!  It's awesome you are doing things for yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to a halloweed party... so I left out a big bowl of candy for the kids.    I accidently left my phone at my house and when I went back for it I had found that within 5 minutes someone had taken the entire bowl of candy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I thought kids didn't do that anymore <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep.... I don't bother putting out candy anymore. <endOfText>
<human> They ruined it for you. Halloween is my favorite holiday <endOfText>

<human> As far as I can. I sometimes don't know that far ahead though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't cooked for my family in a while. Always take out <endOfText>
<human> I definitely suggest a nice home-cooked meal, it's usually a lot healthier than take out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it is. I have just been so busy. <endOfText>
<human> I understand, it's hard to find the time for everything sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my dog just turned 15, it's getting a bit harder for him to walk, it's tough to see. <endOfText>
<human> 15. Wow. That has to be tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I am still single. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that? Are you a man or woman? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The wife and I spent a lot of time getting out previous home ready for sale, as we had to fix a few things and get very, very clean. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am doing the same thing but for a different reason. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so tired of being home and working all day. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, between kids, cleaning, and everything else, its hard to stay energetic <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I checked my bank account this morning and I couldn't be happier. <endOfText>
<human> I love that feeling, though I don't experience it often.  Why did it make you happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the doctor recently but everything turned out fine <endOfText>
<human> That's always good news.  Were you worried something was wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have a device removed due to some issues with it, but I had a couple of small concerns also. <endOfText>
<human> I'm guessing all those small concerns turned out well if everything turned out fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A hurricane is headed my way.  I have been working all day. <endOfText>
<human> A hurricane? That sounds awful! Where is it, I haven't heard anything about one, I live in Florida.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A hurricane? That sounds awful! Where is it, I haven't heard anything about one, I live in Florida. <endOfText>

<human> Ewwwwww.  Kinda gross.  My cats used to do that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy to be independent. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Tell me it gets better lol <endOfText>
<human> It does. Then she turns 13 and is a brick wall lol.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad all the time.  All my boyfriend does is play video games on the PS4. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that! Mine has one too, and it gets frustrating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor is like 90 years old and really shouldn't be driving anything not even lawnmower. He hit my work truck and busted a tail light last night and my blood is boiling! <endOfText>
<human> LOL that is sorta funny though.  I can just picture this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wont forget watching my car on fire. <endOfText>

<human> Thank you!  I am going to go now and finish my laundry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day my baby had to get some of her shots. <endOfText>
<human> I hate shots for babies. Why do they have to get so many?!?!?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it seems like every other month its another shot! I felt terrible for her. <endOfText>
<human> You can tell they are mad at you too for letting it happen. I hate ir <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love pizza. I ordered on yesterday with all of my favorite toppings. <endOfText>
<human> yum sounds good whats your fav toppings?  <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Hey, I was planning a party and asked my friend to get some stuff for it, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> Did he come through? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is not cool to play loud music at 3 am during the week <endOfText>
<human> That would certainly make me upset too, was it your neighbors? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend who never say no to me. Such a great companion she is! She asked me for a help. At the time I was out of town, so I was unable to do a favor <endOfText>
<human> She probably understood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my ex broke up a year ago and I'm starting to miss him <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Is there any chance you two can patch up again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no idea what to do, my daughter has been complaining about bullies. I've had meetings with her teachers but the bullying hasn't stopped! <endOfText>
<human> That is a shame.  I hear that is happening a lot in schools today. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset.  I just found out I didn't get the job I wanted. <endOfText>
<human> Did something go wrong with the interview? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I order some chicken the other day and it was still pink on the inside. <endOfText>

<human> Why were you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm about to uber some lunch for myself. I keep trying to get my lazy children up but they are going to miss out <endOfText>
<human> That just means more food for you. That sounds like a win to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They will be upset when they see the bag, but summer doesn;t mean sleep all day. <endOfText>
<human> Tell them the next time they need to get up if they want good food, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got in my car to go to a baseball game. I was really excited to see some of my favorite players. When I got there, heavy rain started to come down. Eventually they cancelled the game. <endOfText>
<human> That has been happening a lot lately.  Everyone in the US seems to be getting wet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I was getting ready for bed and I saw a ghost in my bedroom. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that's scary! Did you freak out? <endOfText>

<human> oh okay sorry, i was just a little distracted about my car accident the other day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thank you so much, nothing happened to us thankfully my oil pan was broken though <endOfText>
<human> Well that's nothing compared to what could have happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After working with my boss for years and years, we had our first heartfelt conversation the other day. I'm glad she is here for me in a time of need. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got pulled over for speeding today and the cop let me off with a warning. <endOfText>
<human> You must not have been speeding too much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a few months back I was interviewing for a job an was totally confident going in. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> The other day I was getting my mail and my neighbors little grandson accidentally let the little devil chihuahua out! I dont think I have ever run so fast in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! They are terrifying little dogs aren't they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really scared of going in for interviews, I always get too nervous and clam up <endOfText>
<human> Oh I totally hear you there. You cant just like be yourself, and not that being yourself is bad or anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends left me to go to the theme park. I feel really left out. <endOfText>
<human> You still consider them your friends after that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> usps "lost my mail"! I mean i got ALL my mail but not the letter that had a gift card in it!! hh <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's absurd.. Of course it's the ONE that's impotrant. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home and i noticed the door was unlocked when my wife was supposed to be at work. So i go upstairs and there they were having sex. <endOfText>
<human> oh gosh, that's horrible. i can't imagine how you feel. i would be so heartbroken <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am never late, but the other day, my alarm did not go off, so I had to rush getting ready for work. <endOfText>
<human> it happens. i hate being late <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People say i'm so naive but i'm not i just really trust people <endOfText>
<human> I am a pretty trusting person also.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a pretty trusting person also. <endOfText>
<human> I just don't see why i shouldn't trust people if they never broke my trust <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my dog a few days ago. It was really sudden <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks! Have you put up any posters to help you find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On Black Friday, I was in line at a store and it was taking forever. I had to use the restroom so bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah those lines can be super long. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My AC went out yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's horrible.. July is not the time for that! Do you have someone ready to come out and fix it yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone is coming out this afternoon. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear, how hot is it where you are? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, last week I walked into a breakroom and I saw a big pizza laying there for anyone to grab up, however I chose not to take a slice and remain faithful to my diet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, good for you! I would have caved for sure. Pizza is my life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son will have his 18 months shots soon. i'm a little nervous about it. i hate seeing him getting shots <endOfText>
<human> Don't blame you there i remember by kid getting his first shots.  He was so upset and wouldnt stop crying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just found out i am having a baby,  My Wife and some of our friends through me a party.  Greatest day of my life. <endOfText>
<human> Yay!!! Congrats! That's so exciting, i'm really happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You should read the instructions before you start.. You need to work off the prompts.. But hello, <endOfText>
<human> did you go ot college <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh. On Monday, I was writing an email, and my computer crashed. It took forever to reboot. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know! Luckily, the email was saved in my drafts, but my computer was still slow afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> I'm happy for you. I have been in that situation before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the bar alone, it was very sad. <endOfText>
<human> Well, even going by yourself you can always have a good time, especially with alcohol involved! Did you end up having fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disheartened to learn the tv show colony wont be coming back <endOfText>
<human> Awh man, that stinks.. I never watched it before.. I'm assuming you really liked it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to get the promotion. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! Hard work really does pay off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when the Eagles won the Super Bowl. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I think everyone was shocked! The real question is, were you happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife went out of town and I was alone for a whole week. <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never knew what the confidence is. I never felt it before. Until I studied really well for an exam. When I went in the exam hall, I felt confident the first time in my life. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy when my son went to college. <endOfText>
<human> In what college did he go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever felt lonely in your life? I felt once, when I went to Texas. <endOfText>
<human> I suppose I have. Why did you go to Texas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing with my toddler and there was this HUGE spider on his play tent. This spider was seriously so big. <endOfText>
<human> ohh! that is frighting. Didn't you scare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel ready for my trip, tomorrow. Everything is ready. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is about to start again! I am so excited. <endOfText>
<human> It is nice. School can be very exciting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Summers were so much fun when I was kid. <endOfText>
<human> Why were they fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really joyful when my dad got me my first vehicle. It was just a happy feeling <endOfText>
<human> Yeah. I know that feeling., although I had to buy my own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very grateful when my dad got me my first glove. It was for baseball and just very glad he got it for me <endOfText>
<human> Parents can be awesome sometimes. Do you still play baseball? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got back from a job interview. I was able to answer all the questions and the recruiter seem impressed. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a great way to start <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to look at my kids baby pictures for hours on end. <endOfText>
<human> Why would you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devastated when my aunt passed away. She helped raise me so it was tough <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Losing family is always tough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my wallet home and went grocery shopping the other day. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was proud when my brother finished college. He deserved all of it <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Was he the first in your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked so hard on a project, and someone stole it and presented it as their own. <endOfText>
<human> Wao, how did you felt? did you work hard in that project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job and was in danger of losing my home to foreclosure. My family loaned me money and saved me from that. <endOfText>
<human> Well ... I put myself in your place and I admire you because it is something very emotionally tense <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was late for work today. It wasn't my fault. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My department just got shut down. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you lose your job then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School about to start. We have been ready for weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Are you a parent? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally paid off the car. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cheated on at one time, but I stayed true to him and myself . We worked through it and are good now. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad to hear that. If you can get through that, you can get through anything together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> y friend just dumped his girlfriend for a prostitute. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. That is not something you hear everyday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just left for Europe. She'll be gone for 4 years <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you are going to miss her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew told me once of something really stupid that he would do if the situation arose <endOfText>
<human> What situation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my final exam. Now I'll lose my scholarship. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that must be a horrible feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a hamburger from a restaurant and it was raw in the middle. <endOfText>
<human> That's so bad. You must be feeling bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Paid off all my debt. Took 10 years. <endOfText>
<human> That is quite an achievement! How did you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor's house burn down. We can't find where the cats went. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's awful. When did this happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was cleaning out my closet and found a ring I thought I had lost! It used to belong to my grandfather and it made me so happy to find it again, I miss him. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's really nice. Are you going to wear it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a 500 gift card for answering a question at the site on a vendor we use at work today! <endOfText>
<human> Wow nice! What are you going to do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost her cat on Monday. We called the shelter, and they say they might have a cat that matches our description. <endOfText>
<human> That's good news.  Is her cat microchipped? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I moved into my house I was living by myself for the first time <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was scary! Did you like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found $20 on the side walk today <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to find who it belonged to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put in vacation request since January for next week. And now they're telling me they're too busy to let me go. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are they even allowed to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I got done with a game and I had a bat that sort of fell loose in the back of my car. It could have been bad since I didn't have the back on it, but luckily someone stopped me before I got on the highway! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Glad that person helped you out there.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow. Glad that person helped you out there. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. It could have led to a very, very bad accident for someone else. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to another state and my family was left behind <endOfText>
<human> Was that difficult? And is it your extended family, or your immediate family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get hit on by a lot of girls, but I'm happy with the one I got. <endOfText>
<human> How do you respond to the girls who are hitting on you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a job offer but, i'm not sure if I should take it. <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't heard from my girlfriend in 2 weeks. Wonder what's going on? <endOfText>
<human> I hate to say it but, I think that ship has sailed.  She's either dead or not your girlfriend anymore.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate to say it but, I think that ship has sailed.  She's either dead or not your girlfriend anymore. <endOfText>
<human> I was afraid of that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The church bought us meals after my husband broke his back in a car accident. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm so sorry to hear that and glad people at your church are there for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Been waiting to hear back from my wife. She's at the doctor getting checked, and we've been trying for a baby for a long time. <endOfText>
<human> That is so tough. I always feel bad when people have a hard time conceiving because it was so easy for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is a high school baseball player. Last summer we started working on his recruiting process. I'll never forget taking him to his first recruiting camp -- I knew he had talent and was so hopeful that all would go well. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very exciting -- if nervewracking! How did it go for him? (And you  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I'd die of nerves, but it went great! He is a pitcher and had a rough warm-up in the bullpen, so I was worried. But when it was his turn to take the mound, it went great! <endOfText>
<human> That is the *best* feeling seeing hard work pay off! You much have been so happy for and proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds very exciting -- if nervewracking! How did it go for him? (And you ;-)) <endOfText>
<human> I thought I'd die of nerves, but it went great! He is a pitcher and had a rough warm-up in the bullpen, so I was worried. But when it was his turn to take the mound, it went great!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sitting my friend's house while she's on vacation. While mowing her lawn, a rock hit her window. I feel so bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what kind of damage was done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent an evening recently with my Mom looking through old pictures <endOfText>
<human> Must've felt really nostalgic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got a job paying 20k more than me. I've got more experience <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  If it makes you feel even slightly better,  the dumbest, most imcompent coworker I have makes more than me... because you know.. nepotism. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister had a miscarriage :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm so sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you cheat on her?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why did you cheat on her? <endOfText>
<human> Heard she cheated on me, but I should have broken up first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to encourage my peers <endOfText>
<human> thats great it always nice to be encourage.  Really like it when my co workers do it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> got pulled over last night for going 25mph over the speed limit. <endOfText>
<human> That is a bummer.  On the bright side you probably won't do that again! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's at the hospital after a pretty bad car accident. We finally got news she's woken up after being asleep for 6 days. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds terrible, how did she get in the accident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to a restaurant and saw people eating live squid. <endOfText>
<human> that's awkward where was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hello there am not feeling good today <endOfText>
<human> Are you sick? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went back to my old town. Met a lot of my friens from childhood <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a happy homecoming! Or was it bittersweet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend adopted a really elderly dog. I'm so proud of her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's nice! Most people don't adopt older dogs <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally left a very important document at my house that I needed at work. It made me look foolish in front of my boss when I didn't have it :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you explain it to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave my dog at the vet for a week since I've been traveling. It's weird not having him with me <endOfText>
<human> Why do you usually bring him along? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can no longer stand christmas, because once when i was thirteen I had been told I would be getting a playstation. Christmas came and I never got it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I'm so sorry! Is there any part of the season you can still enjoy?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man! I'm so sorry! Is there any part of the season you can still enjoy? <endOfText>
<human> Not christmas no, New years is still decent for me. Everytime I think of christmas my mind just goes red. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad at my friend Eric because he lied to me <endOfText>
<human> Why did he lie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY WIFE IS THE LOVE OF MY LIFE <endOfText>
<human> Why is she the love of your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched IT when I was only six years old. <endOfText>
<human> Were you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my girlfriend planned a surprise party i was not aware of <endOfText>
<human> That is nice of her, did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah much <endOfText>
<human> Who was all there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a haunted house and was scared of the ghosts. <endOfText>
<human> oooh really do ghosts exist  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oooh really do ghosts exist <endOfText>
<human> I believe the do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought the Falcons would win, man was I wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Who won instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I graduated from college last year, I was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing! I went to college for a few years, never ended up graduating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my wife buys food, I eat all of the cookies before she can get any of them. <endOfText>
<human> That isn't nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my test last week. I am disappointed. <endOfText>
<human> Can you retake it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was returning an item at a store and the person in front of me had a whole cart of items to return and was taking forever <endOfText>
<human> Did you say something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was returning an item at a store and the person in front of me had a whole cart of items to return and was taking forever <endOfText>
<human> Did you say anything to the clerk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a fire at my house luckily I had a fire extinguisher. <endOfText>
<human> Was there damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was putting together a puzzle and was certain that I could do it <endOfText>
<human> Did it turn out ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I farted in front of the school last week. <endOfText>
<human> hahaha i can see hoe students laughed at you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What about 3? <endOfText>
<human> i thought so it done in asia <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate went to Paris. I was at the house all alone. <endOfText>
<human> something wrong with your meal or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 3 kicks on an innocent dog <endOfText>
<human> That isn't very nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father died after an illness and I felt as if I could not go on <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother won the lottery last month. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful! I actually won the lottery once myself and it changed my life for a bit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I go to church, I know that the lord is taking care of me. <endOfText>
<human> That must be a good feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother was bothering me on the road trip last week. <endOfText>
<human> Was it something that you could ignore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died. She was 20 years old. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I am sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won the lottery last week, I was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Happiness comes and goes. it could change at any time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I will always be married to each other. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that does not seem very nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I may of got the promotion, but I didn't. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I can't believe I forgot it was my best friend's birthday. I felt like I betrayed our friendship. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I did that last month. I still feel bad. Get them a gift to say sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I had to wait in line forever for food at the mall. There was a lot of people around me and it made me very nervous! <endOfText>
<human> I always try and order my food and get it delivered. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once a year, we make sure our cellar is stocked with food and water. <endOfText>
<human> That is a great idea for when emergencies happen! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend moved away. I was not happy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, where to? That is hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the beach even thou I hate the water. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least there is sand! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I honestly didn't expect free movie tickets when I tried buying my tickets yesterday, it kind of caught me off guard. <endOfText>
<human> I was pleased and shocked at the same time, I will take it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday during the storm, a tree branch fell on our roof and I am lost for words. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I play video games, and I always expect to win. <endOfText>
<human> I expect that too, but it is not always the case. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job that really interested me. I found out what kind of candidate they wanted and made sure to prepare very well for the interview. <endOfText>
<human> After the interview was over I though it went very well. I am so confident I will get the job any day now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been losing pretty bad on this video game Dirt Rally. But recently, with some extra practice, I'm starting to hit the leader boards! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! I've never been able to sit that long, so getting really good at video games is hard for me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I have some good news. <endOfText>
<human> What is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at home and last minute my dad took me to the Yankees game. <endOfText>
<human> That is so thoughtful of him, did you guys catch a ball?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so thoughtful of him, did you guys catch a ball? <endOfText>
<human> No, but it was still fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i would rather starve than eat mcdonalds <endOfText>
<human> tell me more about this <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son sits around all weekend and eats everything. <endOfText>
<human> Tell him to get out and do something! That must be frustrating.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, he pays rent but he definitely uses up more resources than he pays for. <endOfText>
<human> Its hard being a parent... but i am sure you are doing it right!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tell him to get out and do something! That must be frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> Well, he pays rent but he definitely uses up more resources than he pays for.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its hard being a parent... but i am sure you are doing it right! <endOfText>
<human> Well, I try. I moved to Alabama after the divorce and the kids hate it here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made an authentic peruvian dish the other day. it was awesome! <endOfText>
<human> I love peruvian food! What did you make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made lomo saltado ( i hope i spelled that right lol ) it turned out great. i love south american food <endOfText>
<human> That green sauce with the cilantro and the jalepenos is the best! What is lomo? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its steak strips, with ajis onions peppers tomatoes.. almost like a stir fry but better! <endOfText>
<human> Yum! I have all the ingredients for the chicken, I might make that now instead of the bbq chicken, thanks for the idea.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at this major store and the lady ahd like 4 items on the belt , and i wanted to put mines on but she would not move hers <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> So, I lied to my girlfriend about how much education I had <endOfText>
<human> why would you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first day of my senior year impressed me when I met the new science teacher. He was cool and made it easy for everyone <endOfText>
<human> I love it when teachers are down to earth and easy to get along with. What did you like most about him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss my family and friends. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Did something happen to make you miss them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I live in a new state. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is hard, I have the same issue. How far away did you move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to shop after work and I can be really spacy, one time I left my purse in the shopping cart with all my cards and phone in it. <endOfText>
<human> Omg! I am the same way... i always end up putting my list down while shopping. Where are you going?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Omg! I am the same way... i always end up putting my list down while shopping. Where are you going? <endOfText>
<human> I was at the store. I drove off but luckily, when I came back, someone had turned it in, with everything in it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a big error in the last inning and cost my team the game. <endOfText>
<human> oh man, i'm sorry to hear that! We all make mistakes though, so it's okay. don't be hard on yourslef <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i was broke and did not have money, went to the foodbank to get free food <endOfText>
<human> i know how you feel. I'm sorry to hear you're going through this. I just got food stamps so i can buy food for me and my son <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got finished jogging and I'm feeling really tired, but I have a sense of achievement, too <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Its a good time to jog right now in the morning. good for you! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I know it does I am right in FL! I dont jog, I work out but running isnt my thing. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it can be monotonous. What do you do to work out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am taking a risk.. i hope nothing bad happens. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of risk are you taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to let a family move into one of my empty homes because they were in a poor situation. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that's stressful. How big is the family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away and I cried. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry. You must be heartbroken. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was approached by a man that I did not know while walking in the park <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not in the best mood today. I wish it turned out differently. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible. Sorry to hear that. What exactly happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend did something behind my back against me. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst, when you personally know someone that treated you badly. I hope things turn out better for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found out my roommate got a cat while I was gone, which was a little shocking <endOfText>
<human> oh no.. are you upset?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no.. are you upset? <endOfText>
<human> I was at first. But now it's okay. The cat is actually kind of nice and affectionate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared and worried when it came to going to a new high school my sophomore year. I was not sure how it would go <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I think most people feel that way, but it's still a valid feeling. How did it end up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked into the wrong class on the first day of college <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was a little scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After having to retake the class twice, my son finally passed his swimming test and can move on to the next level! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome! Im glad you persisted because that is so important these days, not being able to swim is a real danger! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog was running around in my yard the other day, and she came inside and was being really mean to everyone. Upon closer look she had a splinter in her paw from wood that my other dog chewed up on the porch that I had not cleaned up yet. I felt bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did it take you a long time to figure out what the issue was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a baby last month, so happy. <endOfText>
<human> I know you are over the moon. What did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was reading the news and came across a story about children being killed in a fire. It hurt my heart to think about it <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible, so sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a dream house and i'm so happy <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I'm so envious! How long ago did you buy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing pictures from my summer vacation a month ago with my long distance girlfriend, makes me feel both happy and sad <endOfText>
<human> I bet you had a wonderful time together <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed a test early on in high school. I was real ashamed at how I did <endOfText>
<human> why would you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so super scared of big storms. <endOfText>
<human> The loud roars also make my dog shake and run to the basement <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The lady accused me of being at fault for not honking my horn! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, was anoyone hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was impressed when my best friend graduated as valedictorian of our class <endOfText>
<human> You must have been so proud of their hard work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a flat tire while driving on the interstate. A nice man stopped to help me <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I am glad you got help, that could have been a lot worse <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Riding a big roller coaster for the first time while having a fear of heights, I was kind of worried how I would do <endOfText>
<human> how was the experience? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was almost in a nasty car crash earlier <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, that's terrible. How did that happen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe I did rather well on my Law School Admissions Test. <endOfText>
<human> what do you think your score was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when Lebron left the cavs again! <endOfText>
<human> I too was surprised.  To leave the team again sort of upset me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic when I think about times with my parents in the past. A lot of different get togethers make me feel that way <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way. The times you spend with family should be cherished forever. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won the lottery, I never have to work again. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations?  How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lebron needs to stay in Cleveland <endOfText>
<human> He already left for the Lakers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband hasn't planned a date for the two of us since we were married. Usually he looks for my input. I just found out that he is taking me somewhere special for the weekend. I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> That is sweet of him, marriage can be tough at first, so at least he is trying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was confident when I won honor society preisdent in high school, I beat a really popular girl <endOfText>
<human> Was it a long campaign? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It felt good when Lebron left the Cavs for the Lakers <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt confident when I was able to study all night for a science test. I just knew I was going to do well <endOfText>
<human> how did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my paycheck and there was more money than I was expecting <endOfText>
<human> That is great, did you spend it on anything cool? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend I felt lonely very often, I am glad that is better now <endOfText>
<human> I am happy that you have someone to share your life with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will be starting Law School in January. <endOfText>
<human> That's seriously impressive. Sounds like a lot of work, though. Hope it all works out. Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got all As in my first college semester, and it made me feel really good about myself <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That is great.  Not everyone can say that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Asked a relative to care for our pet while we were gone and the dog ended up missing. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did the relative say what happened? That sounds fishy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In a few weeks I'm going on my first ever trip to Disney World! It's taken me 30 years to get there and I can't wait. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great.  I love taking the kids to Disneyworld.  What do you want to see most? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My last year of high school I worked really hard and got A's all year long <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you were happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not sure I wanted to accept a new job offer. I did not know anyone at this job <endOfText>
<human> Making a change can be hard. Did you take the offer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I procrastinated on turning in a paper for a college class, and she ended up giving me a D for the course overall <endOfText>
<human> were you able to do any extra credit to bring up the grade? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disgusted the way the cavs owner treated Lebron during his two stints with the team <endOfText>
<human> Oh, very interesting. I'm not a fan of the owner either. Why do you feel that way, though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend for years and I got into a fight, I said some things I regret out of anger, she won't forgive me. This is awful. <endOfText>
<human> how long have you two known eachother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hoping to get a new pet this year! <endOfText>
<human> What were you thinking? Have you been thinking it over for a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been faithful to my girlfriend of 2.5 years <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. Hard to find nowadays. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I do too honestly, I used to play all these fun games with our neighbors late summer nights, it was amazing, but I took it for granted <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic thinking about all the games I used to lpay with my friends on our street <endOfText>
<human> I remember those games too. What kinds did you play? My favorite was flashlight tag. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of my friends have these great jobs and they get to travel to awesome places so often. It's not fair, having to watch them jetset and have a blast while I'm stuck working all the time. <endOfText>
<human> I get that, I am not sure how some of these people can afford the places they go! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's ridiculous, everyone has to be so showy. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that is not me at all, I barely post anything to people online <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was surprised when my parents gave me a car as my graduation present from college <endOfText>
<human> How exciting for you. What kind of car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told something to someone that I had promised to keep a secret. <endOfText>
<human> That is not nice! People do that all the time as long as the person they tell is closer to them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is about to start. We are ready. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh I remember those days! All the shopping, making sure to look good for the first day! good times <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been faithful to my girlfriend of 2.5 years <endOfText>
<human> congratulations. marry her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lately, my neighbors want to sit around and gossip about the family across the street. They love to talk bad about them even though it's clear this family is struggling. I'm sick of it <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are, that sounds bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really went into care mode when my dad got sick. I just made sure he was going to be okay <endOfText>
<human> That takes a lot of strength to be able to do that. A lot of people would just break down instead of trying to help however they can. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY electriv bill is through the roof this month. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, did anything out of the ordinary happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was impressed when my friend was our valedictorian in high school <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I get annoyed by my parents, there seems to be such a generational gap between us sometimes <endOfText>
<human> I know exactly what you mean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my ex. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, how did it end between you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to paint my house one color and it turned out another color. <endOfText>
<human> that is no good, I am sorry that happened to you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, yeah its a bummer <endOfText>
<human> It happens I suppose, maybe there is some sort of refund policy where you bought it from <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disgusted when I saw a fight in high school that ended with someone cracking their skull open a bit <endOfText>
<human> WOW! Why do people have to be violent... ugh  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> WOW! Why do people have to be violent... ugh <endOfText>
<human> I do not know, I do not hate anyone enough to do that to them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I though my new neighbors was nice but I was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> thats nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning a trip next month and I am super excited. <endOfText>
<human> Where are you headed to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was embarassed when I was in school and my pants fell down in front of everyone <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How old were you at the time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somebody said something about me that was not true <endOfText>
<human> Please don't care about those people. Try to be true to yourself. World will recognize you one day.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Please don't care about those people. Try to be true to yourself. World will recognize you one day. <endOfText>
<human> That is so true. People like that are not worth the time of day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife forgot to wish me on our anniversary. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been married a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah, It's our 2nd anniversary. <endOfText>
<human> I know that had to hurt. But forgive her and let her make it up to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared when my dad used to scare me as a kid <endOfText>
<human> Dads can be strange like that sometimes. Was he trying to be malicious about it, or just having fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could go back to the first date my girlfriend and I had <endOfText>
<human> Why did things end between you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid and all the stupidity that came with it, I wish I was young again <endOfText>
<human> I was just saying the same thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, the first time  went on a date made me feel very awkward <endOfText>
<human> Why did it make you feel awkward? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friend group, I was so lonely all the time <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame - I'm glad that you've got friends now though. Why was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my son was born i felt joyful and happy! <endOfText>
<human> i bet you did, did you want a boy instead of a girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt guilty when I broke the window in our house <endOfText>
<human> how did it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when the spurs traded away Khawi Leonard <endOfText>
<human> I understand that, he seemed to seal his own fate there, but still sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disappointed when I saw how much the Eagles tickets cost for their opener, I really wanted to go <endOfText>
<human> how much do they run? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking forward to one of my favorite shows coming back on and it was cancelled. <endOfText>
<human> Was it Roseanne? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't live in a good neighborhood. I feel bad for the kids who grow up here. <endOfText>
<human> That can be a hard situation to deal with. Any chance of moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My long distance girlfriend surprised me when she flew in to visit me this past weekend <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that is so sweet! I'm sure you were very happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt guilty when I broke our house window with a football <endOfText>
<human> Oh no... maybe you can get it fixed asap so no one will be upset?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no... maybe you can get it fixed asap so no one will be upset? <endOfText>
<human> It is fixed now, but at the time it was a big deal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I came across an old diary that I wrote in when I was younger. <endOfText>
<human> How does it hold up now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its holding up pretty good! :) looks brand new still lol <endOfText>
<human> well that is good, that seems rare! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow the results will be announced. Awaiting eagerly! <endOfText>
<human> The results for what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's competitive exam and the last level. one step to go to get a government job. <endOfText>
<human> Well, best of luck, I am sure you did awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid, all the games I played with neighbors, just great times <endOfText>
<human> Childhood is a boon and it never be taken again. But everyone wishes to do so.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Childhood is a boon and it never be taken again. But everyone wishes to do so. <endOfText>
<human> That is for sure, I just miss those days a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes even though I have a girlfriend, I wonder what it'd be like to be with someone else <endOfText>
<human> well theres only one way to find out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got mad when I lost my dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I would have too. Did you find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother graduated college and has already gotten a job, I feel pretty happy for him <endOfText>
<human> thats amazing.. im happy for him too.. i bet you are proud  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats amazing.. im happy for him too.. i bet you are proud <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I am. I felt a little jealous, since he graduated before me. But that's okay. I want him to do well, especially since he has a family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago there was a fire in our electrical panel. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's terrifying.get really big? Did it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> luckily no! it stayed in just 1 room on one wall <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy lucky. Well, I'm glad everything ended up okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, that's terrifying.get really big? Did it <endOfText>
<human> luckily no! it stayed in just 1 room on one wall  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a party once and saw someone throw up all over someone else. <endOfText>
<human> That is nasty, did it get on anyone else? that would not be fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was excited when my parents got me a car as a graduation gift <endOfText>
<human> wow ! that's really awesome. What kind of car did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really in shock <endOfText>
<human> Shock? Uh oh, what happened? Is everything okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes its actually great! I got into college. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh... That makes more sense. Well, congratulations. That's a defining point in people's lives. I hope you have a great experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> had to leave my long distance girlfriend to go back home, after I had spent a month of time with her <endOfText>
<human> im sorry.. distance sucks. luckily you guys have skype!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im sorry.. distance sucks. luckily you guys have skype! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, we use it all the time. It's annoying to deal with sometimes, though. And it stinks to only be able to talk and not be able to hang out in person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every year n=on my friends's birthday, I take her out for dinner and drinks. Her birthday was last week. <endOfText>
<human> how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when my dog ran away <endOfText>
<human> Did you find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother's dog pooped upstairs, and I didn't see it, and ended up stepping in it... <endOfText>
<human> No!!! gross... did you flip?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No!!! gross... did you flip? <endOfText>
<human> No, I had my brother clean it up. But it got on my shoe, which wasn't nice to deal with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just received my certification to teach english as a second language! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats!!! Do you already have a job lined up?  <endOfText>

<human> Yes.  I will be teaching children from Asia. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats so awesome good for you <endOfText>
<human> Thank you.  The test was not that easy despite speaking and comprehending English quite well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I really wish I could take a break from work like my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Don't we all!  Work is often times one of the most stressful things in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> you hit the nail on the head there! its rewarding and stressing at the same time ugh! <endOfText>
<human> Where do you suppose you would like to take a break at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe Matt Ryan got 30 million. <endOfText>
<human> That's a large amount of money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so impatient for tuesday. <endOfText>
<human> What happens Tuesday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My house might be sold! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I just wont ever forget the way I felt when I lost my father. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that. how long ago was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was 10 years ago but it never feels any less <endOfText>
<human> I can only imagine.  i hope it has gotten a little easier for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time my car ran out of gas on the side of the road and a friend helped me by getting gas for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that was nice of your friend, that is not a fun situation to be in <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disgusted when I saw someone get their head cracked open during a fight <endOfText>
<human> That's nuts, do you know if they are ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat has been missing for a week. I have looked everywhere. <endOfText>
<human> Have you called animal control? What about putting up flyers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a retail store and encountered a lost child. <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to help? How scary for that child! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend told me she didnt have enough money for rent and that she needed to borrow some money. <endOfText>
<human> I know you're not asking for advice but... DONT. Just dont. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know... but I already did.. hoping for the best :/ <endOfText>
<human> ahhhhhh! I see this on Judge Judy everyday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog got into some grapes the other day when my toddler had hid them in a toy and the dog found them. I know grapes are not good for dogs! It made me so nervous! <endOfText>
<human> My anxiety would have been having anxiety - so I feel you... hows the dog doing today?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My anxiety would have been having anxiety - so I feel you... hows the dog doing today? <endOfText>
<human> She's okay, I think she will be fine, I just dont know how many grapes is too much! Shes eaten an entire package of oreos before so I dont know :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to take a foreign language class for college, and I'm not sure how well I'll do <endOfText>
<human> I bet you'll be fine if you work hard enough. What language is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out my cat is very sick and there's nothing we can do to save him. I've had him for 17 years, I don't know what to do with myself. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad.. im sorry! ugh... i hope you can find peace.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so sad.. im sorry! ugh... i hope you can find peace. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too, I'm going to miss Pants so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad about what I did. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my dad. <endOfText>
<human> At least you feel bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently, I just received an unexpected bonus at work. It was given to me for working extra hard on a project! <endOfText>
<human> how, how are you going to spend it? or are you a saver? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to teach an inservice class at work. I went over all of my notes very carefully <endOfText>
<human> Did it go well for you then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to take this long road trip soon, my car is making this weird noise and I'm not sure if I should still go on it. I'm worried it might break down on me. <endOfText>
<human> You should take it somewhere then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was grateful when my dad helped me buy a car. He was there the entire time <endOfText>
<human> Did he give you tips for getting the best deal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy I survived the weekend. <endOfText>
<human> I feel that, sometimes I feel lucky to survive single days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very happy when I got accepted into graduate school <endOfText>
<human> That is great, which one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was anxious when I applied for grad school, I did not know if I would get in <endOfText>
<human> So what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have three kids. They are great and so am i <endOfText>
<human> I am glad to hear that, it seems like a lot of work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ashamed when I failed my first test in college, I thought I was doing well <endOfText>
<human> It can happen.Were you better prepared for the next one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything seems to be going wrong, one thing after the other. I feel like I could break down but I have to trust that everything will work out the way it's supposed to. <endOfText>
<human> I understand.. i wish life could be eaiser! Im sorry.. whats going on?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I understand.. i wish life could be eaiser! Im sorry.. whats going on? <endOfText>
<human> A lot of things, my mom is sick and needs financial help but I can barely afford my rent after my hours were cut. I don't know if I'm going to be able to afford clothes for my daughter for school, all sorts of things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not feeling in a good mood today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope you feel better soon. Do you want to talk about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thanks im just upset because i had to put my dog to sleep <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry. Have you tried reading Rainbow Bridge, that could provide some comfort. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was Dwayne Johnson. <endOfText>
<human> wouldnt that be cool and your bestfriend would be kevin  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wouldnt that be cool and your bestfriend would be kevin <endOfText>
<human> You mean Kevin Hart? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am amazed that my daughter actually remembered my birthday last month. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad I have to go back to school. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that completely, I still have a bit of time to wait <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was anxious when I applied for graduate school <endOfText>
<human> Did you get in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trusted my dad when he wanted to help me get a new car. I just knew he would do whatever it took to help <endOfText>
<human> That is nice of him, that is a good dad right there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am grateful for my parents, they help me out with so much <endOfText>
<human> How do they help <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy its summertime. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I dislike heat but I love the leisure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely before I met my girlfriend and group of good friends <endOfText>
<human> That is good you met your girlfriend, where did you meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad. I had too much fun while my kids were gone and I want them to stay away for another day. <endOfText>
<human> Nothing wrong with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait for Top Gun 2. <endOfText>
<human> IS that a real thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You won't believe this but I found a winning scratch off ticket on the side of the road! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing!  How much did you win and what did you buy with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just had her first dance recital and remembered all the steps!  It was great to watch! <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet! Always a special moment, how old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife went to her Mom's place. so bored without her <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. My husband went to a friends to work on his car. I'm home with 5 kids! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we lost our car I felt lost. How do you put your life back together without transportation. <endOfText>
<human> oh how sad, how did you lose your car?. Public transportation is not every one's cup of tea.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone backed into me in the parking lot yesterday because they didnt look in their mirror. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, that is unfortunate. are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved celebrating July 4th this year. <endOfText>
<human> That's always a great holiday. What did you do to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is going to start in a few weeks. Not looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm excited personally, I guess you have to like your school and what you're studying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the beach a few weeks ago, and it was great. The beach is so beautiful and serene <endOfText>
<human> I live near the beach, too! It really is great. Although I've been out of town for a while, so I haven't been to it yet this summer. I'm glad you got to go there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lucky you to be so close! Yeah, I had so much fun, especially since I could spend a lot of time with my partner and a lot of time swimming! <endOfText>
<human> Only thing I'm not wild about is dealing with cleaning up afterwards. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually take my brother to lunch for his birthday, but not this year. His birthday was yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Why weren't you able to do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom said some pretty offensive things to me while my dad was in hospice. It's hard to forgive her for them. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes people say things they don't mean when their angry. Maybe you should just let it go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Doing pretty good at work today. Feeling like things are going my way. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome, love the positive vibes. good for you!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats awesome, love the positive vibes. good for you! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks. Yeah, just started the job a month ago. Finally starting to get the hang of it. I work in construction. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in a good mood today. I think I might have found someone special. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa... that's awesome. I love hearing that. Can you tell me about them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> of course, shes super smart and beautiful - 2 killer combos. <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely. I'm glad you're experiencing that. Me on the other hand, I'd be worried that I wasn't good enough for them. But I'm sure things will work out for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend and I are in a long distance relationship. It's rough sometimes not always having the person you love the most around <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is... when can you see her again?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is... when can you see her again? <endOfText>
<human> Not for four months, when she comes to visit for Thanksgiving. She isn't able to take a lot of time off of work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying to keep my cool but its pretty hard right now. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like trouble. What exactly is going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh it is.. I caught my child telling a lie to me. <endOfText>
<human> Dang! I'm not a parent, but I have siblings who have done the same (and of course I've done it to my parents, too). Any idea what you're going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "Looking forward to the start of the college semester. It's my senior year and I feel like I have a grip on things <endOfText>
<human> Well then It's time to dominate. LOL  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well then It's time to dominate. LOL <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that's exactly how I'm feeling, haha. Feels like I'm ready to enter a zone. What about you? You in school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I unable to attend my friend's birthday party. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a bummer. How did he take the bad news? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thinking about a career change, but I'm not sure what to do about it yet... <endOfText>
<human> What are you most interested in doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently retired from my job.  Now I stay at home all day but my wife still does most of the chores.  I feel as though I should be doing more. <endOfText>
<human> That's rough. Why do you think it is that you don't do more? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking my pet and saw a gross dead animal on the sidewalk. <endOfText>
<human> Did you pet try to eat it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my brother to change my oil over a month ago, and he still won't help me. He promised, and yet he keeps putting it off. Kind of annoying. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I can't count on my own family for favors either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to adopt a cat <endOfText>
<human> I love cats. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad school is back, traffic will be horrible. <endOfText>
<human> But kids will be busy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know why I watched a scary movie. <endOfText>
<human> what movie was it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what movie was it? <endOfText>
<human> i don't know I didn't get far. The was a weird kid and rats. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> lol sounds terrible! <endOfText>
<human> it was. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a bad experience moving into this apartment months ago... <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought all of my books for this semester. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure that is a huge relief but quite expensive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is my 15 year anniversary coming up.  I am a lucky man! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. I want that some day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset my aunt did not come to my graduation. I wanted her to be there <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am sorry you are upset. I hope you have another opportunityto see her soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wonder what happened. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a trophy for the chess finals match. <endOfText>
<human> Was it first place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate that game of thrones is ending. <endOfText>
<human> ah me too. Hearing last season will release in April 2019 <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel horrible I lost my dog. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened to it?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really grumpy when my boss scheduled me for my day off. <endOfText>
<human> That isn't right. I wouldn't of gone in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was told by a co-worker the other day that my fly was open.  Appearantly I had been walking around for half the day with an open fly.  My face sure was red. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine how embarrassing that must have been.  I hope you didn't have to give a speech today. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is having a minor surgery today but he is apprehensive about it. I am worried for him as well too. <endOfText>
<human> Minor surgery is still surgery.  I understand that it can be scary for anyone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Especially if its your first.  He will have to be anesthetized. <endOfText>
<human> That is a surreal feeling, I understand his apprehension.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a bad anxiety attack the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  Maybe you should go see a counselor for help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it wasnt over stress, it was because my daughter choked on food <endOfText>
<human> That would cause anyone to have an anxiety attack.  I don't blame you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some of my old childhood toys in the attic and introduced them to my kid. She loved playing with them. <endOfText>
<human> awh thats awesome what did you find?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> awh thats awesome what did you find? <endOfText>
<human> It was a bunch of my old Lego sets from the late 80's and early 90's!  Talk about memories! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my brother graduated college. He worked hard for it <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! What was his major?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great to hear! What was his major? <endOfText>
<human> It was in english <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy I graduated High School. I didn't think I would make it! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure that was a good day for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brand new car was hit in the grocery store parking lot yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> did you catch the person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was impressive that Lebron went to the lakers <endOfText>
<human> I was sad to see him leave Cleveland. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife left me and I have no one else. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife, on the other hand, is very supportive and is the most caring person I have ever met. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, how long have you been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Two ago, I was attacked by a robber during night. He had a knife. I had choice to give him my wallet. Now, I always watching behind when I walk in the street. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. There's terrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my birthday last weekend. Instead of dinner as planned, they gave me a weekend trip to NYC. <endOfText>
<human> It is nice gift for bithday. That is very good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has been cheating on me, worst yet is that it was with my best friend of 20 years. <endOfText>
<human> Wow sounds like what i just seen on the news in NC... im so sorry !!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow sounds like what i just seen on the news in NC... im so sorry !! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for the sentiment.  I have a great support system to help me through this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss my dad. <endOfText>
<human> Has he passed or does he just live far away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> he has passed away, and i just feel alone <endOfText>
<human> I can only imagine.  Are you close with your mother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My main home computer stopped working yesterday? <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that sounds super annoying! What was wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter recently finished potty training! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when I went on vacation from work <endOfText>
<human> That is such a great feeling did you have a great time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray I pass the bar exam. <endOfText>
<human> I remember when my aunt was studying for that.  Did you already take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my grandma passed my family went to her house to clean it out and we found a lot of memorabilia <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally got a job that pays enough for the bills and a bit left over to save for emergencies. <endOfText>
<human> congrats. what type of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ready when that last storm hit us <endOfText>
<human> Storm? What area do you live in? Was it bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my test tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Well, good to see your confidence. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had enraged on driver who was doing rash driving. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a pay raise today! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a cat that was being neglected by its owner. I decided to adopt it at the shelter I'm volenteering at <endOfText>
<human> That's great.  I have a dog I rescued (she was a stray, not from a shelter) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lady got a promotion for a job, because she's related to the hiring manager. <endOfText>
<human> Isn't that illegal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know Alabama will win the SEC again. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry. What's SEC? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Family gave me some money to fix the house we just bought <endOfText>
<human> wow congrats.  how long will it take you to complete the upgrades? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I liked the way Lebron was snatched up by the Lakers <endOfText>
<human> Will be a game changer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so.  I hope they can crush the warriors <endOfText>
<human> Did the Warriors get a replacement? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week was my birthday and I thought that everyone forgot about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Bought a laptop I really needed last month. The price went down by $200. Wish I would have waited. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens! Were you able to get a credit for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoyed taking care of my sister's dog <endOfText>
<human> Do you like dogs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom raised me and my brother by herself. I wish I could take care of her in her old age. <endOfText>
<human> wow thats great, I hope you are able to do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sick of what Harvey Weinstein did. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? I don't know of this news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's boyfriend of 10 years cheated on her. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Did they break up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor volunteered to fix my flat tire. <endOfText>
<human> how nice of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoyed watching sisters dog <endOfText>
<human> Have you watched the dog before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had more friends, I have no one. <endOfText>
<human> best place to find one is online! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was impressive that Lebron left the cavs a second time <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I was happy he left. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could help my mom out more. <endOfText>
<human> I am fortunate enough to live close to mmy family so if they need something I can be there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very fortunate that I lives so close to my grandparents while they were alive <endOfText>
<human> That's really good. No regrets then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is trying to set me up with a family friend's kid. <endOfText>
<human> You gonna go on a date? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. I'm super nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Is it totally blind or have you met before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an old car I used to own driving around (1970 plymouth duster)   the kid that baught it is taking good care of it <endOfText>
<human> That's a good kid. Pretty amazing a 70s car is still going around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was fixed back up. <endOfText>
<human> I definitely need to learn how to take care of cars. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some lady almost got hit by a car, but a little kid actually pushed her out of the way. <endOfText>
<human> WOW! That is impressive! Did you see it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an amusement park with my friends the other day and they talked me into going on a new roller coaster even though I hate roller coasters! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was impressive to see the london team win the overwatch championship <endOfText>
<human> Oh that must have been very exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was impressive to watch that game last night <endOfText>
<human> What game did you watch last night? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The day that I found out I was having my daughter really made me very sentimental <endOfText>
<human> has she been born yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes just turned 5 in June <endOfText>
<human> wonderful, congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter and I had a conversation recently about extending her curfew. I need to believe that she is going to act responsibly. <endOfText>
<human> Was there something that she had done in the past that made you think she wouldn't? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was traveling for work, and I had told my wife that I was staying in for the night, but really I went out for drinks with some people from work. <endOfText>
<human> Have you lied about something like that before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am surprise about the economy nowadays <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in my late 20s and don't have a college degree <endOfText>
<human> What are you waiting for to get one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor asked me to babysit their kid. We've never talked. <endOfText>
<human> Now is a good time to get to know them.  It is surprising if they don't know you well though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to see fammilies show affection with each other <endOfText>
<human> Yes. It is very endearing. Our family are the first people we experience in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went by my old high school, and seeing the students makes me miss my old friends. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. I miss most of my childhood friends as well. My best friend actually moved to Korea when I was 13. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been following my own weight lifting routine, rather than hiring a coach, and I've been making great progress. I feel like research is better than paying someone to help you. <endOfText>
<human> Definitely. If you can motivate and get on a schedule yourself, you can save a lot of money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for this new position in my unit to be posted <endOfText>
<human> What's the position? Are you going to apply for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a cavity filled the other day but now I'm in terrible pain. My dentist said it's possible I need a root canal now and I'm frustrated, that's a lot of money! <endOfText>
<human> oh wow, what do you plan to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure yet. I'm praying that the pain will magically go away. <endOfText>
<human> good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ok with being average. <endOfText>
<human> Are you sure about that? I bet you are more than average. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For various reasons, my mother and I haven't been able to visit each other for 5 years. She's in town now and I am so happy. <endOfText>
<human> What do you have planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried when the Leafs lost in the playoffs. <endOfText>
<human> sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I feel all alone <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait till Thanksgiving. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! Does your family do a large dinner as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset to return to work <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was amazed how much I liked Mission Impossible. <endOfText>
<human> how many series did you watch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel the absence of my brother in home. <endOfText>
<human> Where did he go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He went to abroad for his research study. He'll be back in 2 years. <endOfText>
<human> That is a long time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi.  So I recently found out I was selected to go to a cool work conference out of town.  Only 2 other people in the whole company was invited to go on the work trip! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a good opportunity for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very proud when I see how my kids show so much compassion for people <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  Sometimes kids nowadays only seem to care about themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stand snakes. <endOfText>
<human> Me either, imagine being bitten by one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very mad when my brother got in trouble something he did not do in school. It just made me hate the principal <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know the year will get better. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? What makes you say that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently had a child, got married and bought a house. I'm still single with no kids, living in an apartment. <endOfText>
<human> Is that good or bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very lucky to have a great family. <endOfText>
<human> That is a very lucky thing to have. Do you have a wife and kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not proud to be from New York. <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thankfully ready for an important presentation at work that I had to give a while back. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, chance favors those who are prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree.  It certainly helped my anxiety too. <endOfText>
<human> Do you take any mediciation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's hard giving birth, any way you do it, but I was still so happy when my kids were born <endOfText>
<human> I am glad they are healthy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when my dad got me a new truck. It was just something that I did not expect <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great!  I wish I had a truck, they're so useful.  Does everyone ask you to help them move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm moving out of state with my boyfriend in a month or so for a new start! I am very optimistic about it! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds interesting. How far are you moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago after a divorce, my roommates moved away and I gotta tell you, it was rough after that. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, that sounds rough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was aggravating when I was fired for something I did not do. I knew the company was not for me then <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  What made them think it was you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a giant exam that counted for half of my semester grade. I was really nervous over it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! Please tell me you passed it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did! I studied for weeks and re-watched lectures. I felt really good when I walked into the classroom to take it. <endOfText>
<human> wow, you must be so proud of yourself! Good job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I appreciate  having the chance to be there for people when they are in need. <endOfText>
<human> I love to be able to help people when I can also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really makes me feel good to be a part of the good <endOfText>
<human> I understand what you mean. I feel like a better person and know I have accomplished something by making them feel better also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my daughter more than words can say and it is so hard to see someone hurt her. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling.  I wish we could take away the pain for our kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got in trouble at work for not making my schedule, but it is their fault because they gave me one they knew I couldn't work <endOfText>
<human> That sounds shady.  Did it ever get worked out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasextremele upset when I found out a classmate was being cruel to my daughter <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is terrible! Kids are so mean! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of the sudden my light bill went from 150 a month to 398! <endOfText>
<human> What happened to make it that way <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family member was going through a hard time. It just made me feel bad for them and caring <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it's hard to see people you know and care about struggling.  Are they doing better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going for the driving class. My trainer appreciated me today. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Are you getting better at driving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had always been early to work and never late until this past month. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good to hear and do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt like I was going to do well on a test. I studied all night <endOfText>
<human> How did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been approved for law school after a long arduous process. <endOfText>
<human> That is outstanding!  I bet you are excited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very happy when my children are happ <endOfText>
<human> That is the greatest feeling in the world, to see them smiling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They are calling for bad weather here over the next few days so I went to the store to stock up on the essentials in case the power goes out. <endOfText>
<human> I would be scared of that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I missed my cousins wedding. I had no excuse and I still feel bad <endOfText>
<human> So why didn't you end up going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sister got fired recently. I was happy <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that can be stressful, Why were you happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting ready to meet my final exams. <endOfText>
<human> when are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when I found my dog <endOfText>
<human> oh, did you lose it somewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little upset when I didnt get to leave work early <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that is no good! Why didn't you get to leave early? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got promoted at my job. It was something I had been trying to obtain for a long time. <endOfText>
<human> wow congrats, how long have you worked there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> With all the catfishing going on these days I was shocked when my Tinder date turned out to be better looking in person. <endOfText>
<human> I feel like since the show, catfishing has decreased a little bit. It's easy to determine when someone is using fake pictures. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you heard about Double Dare coming back to tv? I watched it the other night and it took me right back to my childhood! <endOfText>
<human> No I didn't that's pretty awesome lol...is that the show where celebrities get slimed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last Monday was my birthday and when I arrived home from work a little late my family and friends was there. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a surprise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to hang out  with my best friend everyday and now I have no one to hang out with. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lakers getting Lebron was impressive <endOfText>
<human> I saw that.  It was pretty crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like my children will grow up to be very compassianate human beings <endOfText>
<human> wow thats a good feeling to have <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is pretty awesome.  I'm new to the entrepreneur life and just paid my full rent with 100% self-employed profit. <endOfText>
<human> Well that sounds just wonderful! What kind of entrepreneur are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a final warning at work today for something I didn't even do! <endOfText>
<human> Did you try talking with your supervisor 1 on 1? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did but then the floor manager came over to us and threw me and attitude, so I threw a chair and walked off. <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope it works out for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a video of an Asian guy chopping down a banana tree with leg kicks..it was pretty insane <endOfText>
<human> That is really weird, did he actually knock the tree down and how thick was the tree? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting home from work one day and was feeling hungry. I wasn't able to eat at lunch break at work. When I got to my house a friend of mine was there and had pizza! <endOfText>
<human> Nice did your friend give you a piece? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife received an award at work for her hard work on a particularly difficult work project! Man, I was happy for her! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. You must be so proud of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am!  It feels really good to know that she is successful in what she does. <endOfText>
<human> She's a lucky lady! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Turning 21 next week. I hope I hit it off with a girl <endOfText>
<human> That's a good goal!  I recommend online dating if you are trying to meet many different women! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello buddy! So you know when you've just ace'd all the final exams and you can just enjoy your time off with out worrying? <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling of finish finals, but not with all A's. Congrats buddy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend of 10 years broke up with me yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Awww man that stinks! I thought you two were going well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Catfishing should be illegal I swear...I'm not shallow but if you need a bunch of makeup and filters try hating yourself less and go to the gym or get a job that gives your life meaning! Rant over. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, people who catfish need to get their priorities straight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Waiting to hear what the loan officer says on my home loan application <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope they say YES with a very low interest rate. Will this be your first home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Saw a guy and girl racing each other. The girl was way ahead <endOfText>
<human> Fine, what did happen at last? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did a major mistake in my work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been sick and it's been hard to take care of my 3 kids during the day. My husband came home early from work to help out, I'm so thankful for him. <endOfText>
<human> Being sick does stink at times. But at least your husband is there to assist when in need. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i forget some stuff i did as a kid. But when they come back to me i love what i remember. Found out a old game i used to play when i was like 7 <endOfText>
<human> What was the game? That happens to me all the time too, it's a treat to remember such great times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know why I did but my friends aren't speaking to me and It feels very isolating. <endOfText>
<human> have you asked them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you asked them? <endOfText>
<human> They ignored me when I did. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe what happened today. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found money on the ground! <endOfText>
<human> How much! Sometimes things happen like that when you really need them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked so hard on a project to find out that they had 2 teams working on the same thing. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I hate when people feel like it's okay to waste other peoples time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece will soon turn 20 and as she was discussing her birthday plans all I could think of was a time when she was small <endOfText>
<human> aww, it's amazing how fast time flies and how quickly kids grow up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, so guess what my roommate did 2 months ago with my rent money. <endOfText>
<human> did he lose it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost over $10,000 in an investment. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, seeing that news probably knocked your mood down hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There were a lot of reasons why I needed to put my pictures of my mom away after she died but I found one this morning out of nowhere and it brought back some great memories instead of tears for once. <endOfText>
<human> Im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears! Its hard losing a parent.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im glad to hear it brought memories and not tears! Its hard losing a parent. <endOfText>
<human> It is, I don't wish this on anyone but unfortunately, most of us have to go through it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im feeling pretty good today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Is there any specific reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its been a good day at work, it just put me in a good mood! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Do you have good days often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son recently scored "Advanced" in every subject on his LEAP test in third grade. I'm so proud of him. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Gotta take credit for those genes haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've learned that to be the best version of myself means working at a skill striving to be the the best at it until haters become fans <endOfText>
<human> I absolutely agree with that mind set! Pick something you're passionate about and do it with passion! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am kind of nervous but hopeful... <endOfText>
<human> About what exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend borrow my car today. <endOfText>
<human> What did he need it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the worst headache and I yelled at my kid a few minutes ago for being so loud. I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> They are just kids, I think you should give them toys to play with and also take a pain killer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I passed all my professional exams and got the company it's biggest clients, don't you think I deserve promotion? <endOfText>
<human> I think so! That sounds like you worked so very hard for the company! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today has been awesome. I just feel like life is finally coming together! <endOfText>
<human> I am glad that it is <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thanks! :) <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to have things like that happen <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> One time I went to an interview for a really competitive internship with a great company in my field. I thought it went great and that the interviewer and I had a great conversation, but it turned out I didn't get it. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, those are rough when you are so hopeful about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it was really disappointing! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, hopefully your still looking for another internship. <endOfText>

<human> Did you call to complain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was worried when I was deciding whether to put my schooling on hold <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Why would you considering putting it on hold? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent $60 on a game that was really hyped up of being amazing and I just really couldn't get into it! <endOfText>
<human> That is disappointing.  I wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can hype you up for it.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is disappointing.  I wonder if you can see if anyone you know is doing it and they can hype you up for it. <endOfText>
<human> One of my other friends also bought the game, but he also dislikes the game. I guess we're both out of $60 now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took credit for some work that wasn't mine. My coworker has not found out yet. <endOfText>
<human> oh no... will you tell them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no... will you tell them? <endOfText>
<human> I don't know.  I feel really bad.  Should I fess up? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> yeah it was and my dad made sure to bring me back into the store to say i was sorry.. all of that for a peep. <endOfText>
<human> That was very cool of your dad.He taught you a lesson. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally feel like everything is coming together for me, either that or I have just learned how to control my stress. <endOfText>

<human> That sucks! Have you been able to contact the bus company yet and get it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In elementary school, I forgot to do an assignment once. Instead of telling the teacher this I stole my friend's French assignment and erased his name and handed it in as my own. I felt terrible about it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that was a long time ago, I am sure that you regret it now and have learned from your mistake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always make plans to go out with my friends but end up staying home. <endOfText>
<human> Its okay to stay at home <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared my first day of high school. I was nervous how it would go <endOfText>

<human> That is never a good thing to do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend said she was going to catch up with her ex boyfriend over coffee. I am sure that nothing shady will go on between them. <endOfText>
<human> Surely not, do you trust her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At first I was scared, but she has done nothing to make me worry about her in the past. <endOfText>
<human> Then I wouldn't be worried, you can't live your life that way. If someone wants to cheat, they will find a way.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Surely not, do you trust her. <endOfText>
<human> At first I was scared, but she has done nothing to make me worry about her in the past.  <endOfText>

<human> I am very sorry to hear about your loss. take you were very close. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sue I will get a promotion at work. <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear!  Part of being successful is being confident, and you sure sound confident! <endOfText>

<human> oh no, did you ever get caught <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog escaped my yard last week and got pretty far, I was worried! <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were, poor pup <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My sister really gets on my nerves. She was supposed to do me a favor <endOfText>
<human> because of my illness i got some frustration too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my dad to play basketball with me yesterday. I forgot that he used to play at a very high level and beat me badly! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Yeah, some times those things do happen, and you0\=i just have to have trust you know> <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Last night, I did the most unfortunate thing. I ate three entire bags of Totinos 250 count pizza rolls. <endOfText>
<human> Think I've done that, too. No regrets, my friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weekend was so chill and quiet. Now my kids are back <endOfText>
<human> are they being loud and annoying like usual? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in high school i ran the game club. My normal ride made left me early. <endOfText>
<human> What's game club <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a promotion at work which was unexpected! <endOfText>
<human> Well congratulations! What will you be doing at your new billet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, my brother committed the unforgivable crime of eating the last twinkie. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, how dare he! Doesn't he know that is forbidden <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found someone's scarf the other day and returned it to her. She completely bawled. <endOfText>
<human> that was nice of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was using the bathroom on a train in rome. I didnt lock the door properly and a woman walked in on me. She laughed. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. How'd that go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in awe when people turn their live's around for the better <endOfText>
<human> Me too! I helped a guy with his immigration case and saved him from being deported. He ended up becoming a pastor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night was quite a low point in my life. I ordered 12 Big Mac's from the drive thru of McDonalds. <endOfText>
<human> Big Mac's are heaven in your mouth. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did you buy for Black Friday? <endOfText>
<human> I stayed at home - I hate trying to fight over that 50% off pack of pencils at Staples. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night was an incredibly low point in my life. I went dumpster diving for food at my local Burger King. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, what led you to this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, I am often the only employee in my building. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's a small company and the other folks in my department just work part time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, you must have a lot of responsibility there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new puppy recently. I had been looking forward to it for so long! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! You must be really happy about it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds fun! You must be really happy about it. <endOfText>
<human> I am! He is a toy poodle and he's got the cutest personality. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, I felt trusting only a few times in life, the first time was then i began to date a new girl. I trusted she had changed from her past relationship. <endOfText>
<human> Why didnt it work out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is about to start. I can't wait <endOfText>
<human> Are you attending post secondary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling very positive about finally succeeding in busines. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great. Was it a promotion or maybe a raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an important job interview and i am nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! What is it for? Just remember to think of all your good qualities and the interviewers :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ashamed. I wasted 300 on an exercise bike <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Well are you going to use it? Why are you ashamed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends threw a party for me when I got promoted at work. I couldn't believe it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's awesome. Congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some kids aren't as fortunate as mine. <endOfText>
<human> Can you explain more? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I saw a woman in the bus that her lollipop felt on the floor. She took the lollipop, clean it, remove a hair that was on it and put it back in her mounth. <endOfText>
<human> That is so disgusting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year my little boy almost failed the second grade. I have been helping him study and can you believe that he passed third grade with an A in every subject. I am beside myself. <endOfText>
<human> I am a teacher so I understand.  You must be working well with him!  Do teachers know what accommodations to make or how to differentiate for him to be successful in the classroom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am doing so well in school. I amazed myself. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! What do you go to school for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a stray cat and took it home. He was sick and I nursed him back to health. <endOfText>
<human> How sweet. How is it now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He;s doing well and he's my buddy for sure. <endOfText>
<human> It great that he has a good home then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 66-year-old retired dad is having to babysit my brother's kids over the summer, who are under the age of 5. I have to say, he's putting up with it pretty well." <endOfText>
<human> He must love his grandkids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so alone now that I'm single. <endOfText>
<human> Don't feel bad, many people are experiencing the same feelings.  Try to focus on meeting new and interesting people! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mad at my coworker. He left for an extended work deployment and I inherited all his unfinished work. <endOfText>
<human> That's not fair. Why didn <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's not fair. Why didn;t they split it up with more people. <endOfText>
<human> You would think they would, but no.  What makes it worse, is my coworker knew I was being left with his stuff and he made no attempt to close anything out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been thinking about rescuing an animal. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds pretty admirable. What kind of animal? Dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really proud of my mom because of how she's stepping up to help my brother raise his children as he struggles to do it alone <endOfText>
<human> Thats very admirable. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like scary things but I really like Stephen Kings new show. <endOfText>
<human> I'm about to watch it! Please don't spoil it. I'm excited for it, even though I've only seen a couple of TV shows and movies based off of his books, and only read a couple of the actual books <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I lied to my girlfriend once about how much education I had because I felt she would leave me otherwise <endOfText>
<human> Did you ever come clean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my dog the other day. They were my best friend since 12. Don't know what I'm going to do.. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry.  Our pets are not just pets... they are part of our family.  Go through the grieving process, even if it takes time.  You deserve that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't afford a new car. <endOfText>
<human> Are you deep in debt with medical expenses? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will be getting into some major debt myself soon with law school. <endOfText>
<human> Law school Wow <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasted beer all over myself at a party the other night. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a sticky, stinky mess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is nights like this when I am alone that I will cherish when I start back to school.  But tonight seems a bit lonely with no one around. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. I'm in the same boat. At least I have two dogs with me. Do you have any friends around <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really get scared when I am around dogs. <endOfText>
<human> Some dogs can be very intimidating. I can understand that. Did something bad happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I have something to admit. I ate the rest of a co-workers sandwich the other day. I havent told anyone. Not my proudest moment. <endOfText>
<human> That isn't nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are so terrible sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> That's rough. I've been around my siblings kids long enough to know how rough they can be, even though I don't have my own. How old are they, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 3 and 4. They came running in here and wasted my last Dr Pepper. <endOfText>
<human> Dang.. I love Dr. Pepper too. They can be selfish sometimes, but we just have to remember that they have developed the parts of their brain to make them care about more than just themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to see my long distance girlfriend in a week! Really happy we managed to afford a plane ticket so we could meet again <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Long distance can be tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband has been clean from drugs for 4 years now. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that's quite an achievement. Everyone loves a good redemption story. How did you cope with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Stepped in dog poop and tracked it all throughout my parent's house because I didn't know I had done it. Then I had too clean it up. Really annoying... <endOfText>
<human> When did this happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know my Falcons will win the Super Bowl this year. <endOfText>
<human> Falcons fan, huh? That's cool. I like the Green Bay Packers. You guys knocked us out of the playoffs a couple years ago because of our bad defense :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I beat all of the crazy crowds for back to school shopping. <endOfText>
<human> That was smart. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really worried I will let my father down. <endOfText>
<human> Why would you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ate the last biscuit this morning during breakfast. Then my child came in asking for another one and I felt really bad. Oh well. Maybe I'll get her something as a treat tomorroow. <endOfText>
<human> It really makes a parent feel bad when that happens. I live with what my neighbor calls mom guilt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Didn't get to exercise today. I feel like I'm lazy <endOfText>
<human> You can still exercise now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had  more friends. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Do you think you struggle to communicate with people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really hoping my brother comes through and can fix my car so that I don't have to spend as much money to fix it. Otherwise, I don't know how I'll pay rent <endOfText>
<human> It is stressful situation. I hope your brother find time to help you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid, I was pulling water from well in my grand father house. When the bucket was out of the well, a live snake was floating inside of it. <endOfText>
<human> that's crazy. Snakes are one of my worst fears. Was it poisonous, do you know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its frustrating to get paid less than other people when you are doing their job <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you are? How did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even though they're in their 60s and have been together for the past 30 years, my mom and dad still get giddy around each other. Makes me happy <endOfText>
<human> Thats really awesome that they are still so much in love.  do you have a significant other? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away and some kind person brought him back to me <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome! So many times they don't come back.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's so awesome! So many times they don't come back. <endOfText>
<human> I know I was so thankful and happy to have him back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom went through a bad surgery and has recovered well. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad to hear. What kind of surgery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so tired of cleaning dirty diapers. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. I've had to change the diapers of my nieces and nephews for the past 15 years, as they've come and gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a fly inside this house and I can't, for the life of me, kill it. I'm trying to work peacefully and it just keeps buzzing around <endOfText>
<human> I hate that. Flies and gnats are so annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was grateful I was live after a car wreck. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad your ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little sister is getting married!  I am so happy for her and can't wait for the wedding! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting!  When is the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I won $100 on a scratch off lottery ticket and I couldn't believe my luck <endOfText>
<human> I haven't won on a ticket in a long time, but I once one $300!! Spend it on anything fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked!  I am currently saving up money for a vacation, so it all just went towards that <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's still fun! I spent mine on paying off a credit card in part, which is boring but lead to more money in the long run. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting ready to make the toughest decision of my life tomorrow. Have to turn myself in for a hit and run that I did 2 days ago. Guilt has been eating me up <endOfText>
<human> Why did you lie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I used salt instead of sugar in the cake I baked. <endOfText>
<human> Whoaa.... You probably had to throw that away immediately, huh? Don't worry, my sister-in-law forgot to put eggs in a cake one time and it came out like a brick. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has been very sick for the last 12 years and is finally feeling better and I am so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Whoa! That's incredible. What caused the change, finally? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure am glad I have the mother that I do. She's so patient and forgiving, and kind and caring. She's helped me become the good person that I am today <endOfText>
<human> It is wonderful to have a good parent.  They really do shape their children for better or worse.  I'm so glad you have a great mother! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My bus didn't show up on time and I had stand out in the rain for an extra 20 minutes earlier. <endOfText>
<human> That's odd... Usually buses are always on time. Maybe the weather had something to do with it. I'm sorry to hear that happened to you. All dried off now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "Had a really good spaghetti dinner tonight. Just relaxing and getting some work done now. Feeling pretty accomplished today <endOfText>
<human> Big dinners are always a great way to tie everything up at the end of the day. Was it a pretty long day for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's such a bummer that I did badly on the job interview I had today. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. Are you sure you did that bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every good show on tv is ending or has already ended. <endOfText>
<human> What shows are you thinking of specifically? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to get paid on Friday! <endOfText>
<human> payday is the best day! What are you doing to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset Brian Lawyer died. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's horrible. Who's Brian Lawyer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've just started taking a new body building supplement and it's working wonders so far. <endOfText>
<human> What is the name of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will be able to get my speeding ticket overturned. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh no, were you pulled over wrongly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has learned to read and it is so rewarding to see her continue to grow! <endOfText>
<human> Thats great news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is about to find out that I had to steal $20 from him to pay for gas, since I was in such a bind. He's gonna be so mad at me <endOfText>
<human> Did you really steal it or was it more like borrowing without asking first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Watched an old TV show that I used to watch with my ex-girlfriend. Made me yearn for those past times. But trying not to get too down in the dumps about it. <endOfText>
<human> What show was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spend way too much money on food. <endOfText>
<human> That's a tough one. Do you eat out a lot? That's usually the culprit. I had to learn how to cook for myself so I could afford to live. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really don't want to start my new job in a week. It's at a fast food place and I don't know if I'll be able to keep up with demand <endOfText>
<human> Those jobs are hard. You can always try it and see if you like it. I recommend a temp agency they often have nice desk jobs. Some even offer work from home jobs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had someone steal my lawn mower. I never had anything stolen since I lived here. <endOfText>
<human> that's terrible. Was it an expensive one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad just passed away. Even though I haven't lived near him to be able to see him often in a long time, I really feel his missed presence. It just feels... strange <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, I hope he is in a better place now! How old was he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in awe at the driving ability of my aunt, she's old but she still has it! <endOfText>
<human> Right on! That's cool to hear. Everyone likes to rag on older people driving. Glad to hear she's the exception. What kind of car does she drive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having a party this weekend and I already got my grocery shopping done for it! I refuse to be last minute like last time. <endOfText>
<human> I have a friend who plans ahead like that.  I'm a last minute gal.  I think you will be less stressed by planning ahead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was at work today, wearing some slightly tight jeans, since they're slim fit, and I bent over and they split. Just like in the movies. I meant people could see my undies... <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, I would have been so embarrassed! How'd you react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About to take my driver's license test in a few days. Been practicing for a while now. I know I'm about to smash it <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear you're confident! I'm sure you'll do well if you've been studying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got caught speeding and lied to the cop about why, so he let me go. I feel kind of guilty/ <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, everyone speeds. Terrible to get caught. Hopefully you weren't speeding in a neighborhood, were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> just heard a thump upstairs in a house I'm house sitting all alone at. Really don't want to go check it out <endOfText>
<human> Don't go check it out. That never turns out well in horror movies. Bring a gun then or another person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our water company decided to tear our street up, start on mine for like the third time in a year to replace pipes again <endOfText>
<human> Yikes... sounds like they need to hire better people. Hopefully the noise isn't too loud in the morning <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got hit with a parking ticket the other day as the lady was writing it. I begged her to stop writing it in the middle of it... and wouldn't you know it, she did! So thankful. <endOfText>
<human> That is lucky! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker made a mistake and blamed it on me! <endOfText>
<human> Seriously? How? What was the mistake? Did you talk to him about it, or your boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sitting next to my baby brother who's two-years-old, and he's just ripping farts. Really wish I didn't have to stay with my parents during the summer while college is out <endOfText>
<human> Wap you must be disgusted with the farting. were you mad? or are you used to this kind of situations? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Watched an old Tv show I watched as a kid--a cartoon. Reminded me of the time I used to spend with my brother after school, when there was nothing we had to care or worry about <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like the good old days seemed more relaxing and care free. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pirated a few games recently and I'm enjoying the hell out of them. I sort of feel guilty for not supporting the developers though. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah... that's a tough one. I've pirated stuff before. Kind of how it goes as a poor college student. Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Saw my brother graduate college last month! Felt so happy for him finally achieving what he's worked hard for. Hope he gets a job soon, though <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, the exact opposite is true for me. My little brother is just about to start his first year of college next month! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been pretty pissed off about the slow internet speeds lately. I think it's the weather? <endOfText>
<human> Who knows.. I've dealt with slow internet all my life. Wish I could finally get a decent ISP. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have bad panic attacks about death after experiencing so much of it the past year <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. I assume lots of folks close to you have entered eternity lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I took a flight. During the flight, I went to toilet and a woman came just after me. She kept knocking on the door repeatedly, aggressively and multiple times. <endOfText>
<human> Haha.  Makes it hard to take care of business, and you'd think she'd get the hint from the locked door!  I would have sat longer "just because." <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new city for work. I do not know anyone that lives here. <endOfText>
<human> You should put yourself out there and meet some new people.  Just start exploring the city and you are bound to meet others! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This lady at the store was yelling and hitting her toddler the other day when I was shopping. I was appalled at what she did. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, no parent should ever abuse their children like that. Did you or anyone do anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to, but didn't know what my place would be in that scenario.  It was quite maddening and off putting. <endOfText>
<human> Yea I totally understand where you're coming from. Hopefully someone nearby was able to call CPS or law enforcement. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered pants online that I thought would fit, and they didn't! <endOfText>
<human> Lol, what a bummer. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Apparently my legs grew and I didn't notice! I do workout four days a week. <endOfText>
<human> Well there you go, at least you a got a positive out of a negative situation haha! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked to see how many hotdogs they were eating at one. This has to be a sin...and a gigantic waste of food. <endOfText>
<human> Where did this happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY favorite restaurant was closed today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, why were they closed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I get bogus mail all the time including fake checks and all that jazz. Anyway, I thought one I got the other day was bogus too and left it on my counter. <endOfText>
<human> Why would you always get fake checks? That would drive me crazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid of airplanes. <endOfText>
<human> O really? Any specific reason for this fear? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so fortunate to have a good mother. <endOfText>
<human> I have to say that is a true blessing. I have a wonderful mother myself. Why do you say she is a good mom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy when my son won his swim race. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, congrats! yes when your kids acomplish something it is very happy for us parents! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some guy cut me off in traffic the other day and made me spill my coffee.  I was pretty upset. <endOfText>
<human> He couldve killed you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been single for a while. I miss having aman around the house. <endOfText>
<human> I know that can be hard.  How long has it been since you've been out with someone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, last night, my devious little mutt of a dog Mimi pooped all over the kitchen. <endOfText>
<human> That must of been no fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not like ants. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not too fond of them myself. Why don't you like them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the latest night ever a few years back when I was in high school. I reviwed words all night but I aced that test. <endOfText>
<human> Sweet, was it a difficult test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, doesn't it grind your gears when people make actual racist remarks? <endOfText>
<human> Yea that is the worst. I don't understand how it can comeout of here mouth <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend died last month. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that escalated quickly. I'm hoping this is not real? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't a giant puddle in the aisle and I tripped on it. I was so humiliated... <endOfText>
<human> Did you hurt your self? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got some bad news yesterday...my grandmother was admitted to the hospital for cancer. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry for the bad news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my wedding day. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! What are you doing to prepare for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was going out to my car this morning, I was greeted by the disgusting sight of a dead possum. <endOfText>
<human> It probably stank a lot too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so annoyed at President Trump <endOfText>
<human> I am too! I am really not a fan on how he is handling relations with Russia. What makes him annoying to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am reay for school to go back. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! These kids in this house are driving me crazy.  They need to get back on a schedule. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years back I got separate from my hunting party. I had to spend the night in the woods by myself. <endOfText>
<human> That must of been no fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad I couldn't go to Disneyland. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Ive only been once but it was great. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is so silly. Sometimes its okay. Sometimes its annoying. <endOfText>
<human> How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not believe I lied to my mother. <endOfText>
<human> What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, last week, I thought I lost my driver's license...it was a bad day. <endOfText>
<human> That would be scary! Can you imagine what the dmv is like?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be scary! Can you imagine what the dmv is like? <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I have been to that awful place before. Fortunately, my neighbor returned it to me - I left it on top of my car before going to work. I was pretty thankful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am loyal to my wife. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Everyone should be loyal to their spouse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the nastiest thing on tv. A guy at a sandwich and it was crawling with spiders. It made me sick. <endOfText>
<human> He must of been crazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started a new job yesterday. I hope I perform well at it. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck with that. Do you found yourself confortable in your new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About four years ago, my apartment was robbed. I discovered the state of my apartment. Everything turn over, any object that had some value was taken. I was totaly destroyed. <endOfText>
<human> Holy moly, that must've been a very depressing sight. Did the police end up finding the culprit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A month ago, I was surprised by a visit by my parents for my birthday. They helped paint my house! <endOfText>
<human> The visit would be the best gift ever and the paint job a huge bonus. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am about to enter the workforce again soon. Hopefully <endOfText>
<human> What job are you going to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> President Trump annoys me. <endOfText>
<human> I think he annoys most people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, last night I was enjoying myself watching a movie. I ordered pizza and it didn't come on time. It was an hour late! <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you were starving! Did they say why they were so late? <endOfText>
<human> Oh, they said they were over-saturated with orders, but come on! An hour is way too long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't find my debit card all week and I've finally given up. I think I have to get it replaced. <endOfText>
<human> Aw man, I've been there before. Has anyone tried using it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently began my own online business. I'm hopeful that my dried starfish kiosk will take off soon. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds unique. What exactly do you sell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car was broken into last night. I lost my laptop, loose change I had in the cupholders, my GPS, and they yanked my radio set out. <endOfText>
<human> Did you call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am helping my father as he has gotten older. <endOfText>
<human> Is he unable to take care of himself now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bowling alley yesterday all alone - my friends ditched me. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, did you still have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hillary Clinton annoys me <endOfText>
<human> She annoys me as well! She seemed pretty fraudulent in the last election. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my last final exam for the semester yesterday. I think I did smashing on it. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! What subject was it in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, my last partner put me through the ringer. There were so many trials and tribulations <endOfText>
<human> I hear that, my friend. It ain't exactly easy living with mine, but ya gotta do it for love. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, I really enjoy playing card games. I used to play in tournaments and compete, but that was a long time ago. <endOfText>
<human> I love card games also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sick that I send Obama money for his campaign. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, why are you even still sending him money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to traffic court the other day and was promised that I would get off with a warning, but I ended up with a $300 fine.  I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> So much for them being up front for you. Man $300 for what thats a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a ton.  I was going 5 over in a construction zone, but no one was around where I was.  So aggravating! <endOfText>
<human> Yea construction zones are crazy, so often nooones there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I placed a sports bet last Saturday. I knew I was going to be right and get paid out! <endOfText>
<human> That would be exciting! What do you plan to do with your winnings?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Place even more bets! <endOfText>
<human> That could lead to a gambling problem! I always run away with my winnings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be exciting! What do you plan to do with your winnings? <endOfText>
<human> Place even more bets!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost got into a car accident yesterday. Have you ever been in one before? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I hate that so much. The sound of screeching and crushing metal is traumatizing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did my homework ahead of time. I knew I would not have any free time over the busy weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Smart move - it's always a swell idea to get ahead of work so that we can do the things we want to do in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could of said goodbye before my friend died. <endOfText>
<human> Aw man, that has to be rough. Were you guys really close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog peed all over the fresh, funky socks that I just purchased. <endOfText>
<human> Did you return the socks? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, unfortunately the store wouldn't take them back. As punishment, I am forcing my dog to wear the socks. <endOfText>
<human> That is mean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had kept my Maxima instead of buying an SUV. <endOfText>
<human> I like driving closer to the ground. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so scared of waterbugs. <endOfText>
<human> What do you have against the ole waterbug? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow is a fine day for me - I start my new job. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No one showed up for my birthday party. I was so alone and sad. <endOfText>
<human> That would be depressing, did you plan it yourself or did someone plan it for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son failed his physics exam yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, was it an unfair test or did he not study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night was trash night and I forgot to take out the rank kitchen trash. <endOfText>
<human> Ewww, throw that away ASAP. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so hungry and broke. My mother loaned me some money for food and I am VERY thankful. <endOfText>
<human> What a nice gesture! What did you get to eat after not eating for so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today, I ran over some roadkill on my way home from work. It was rather disgusting. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a dead possum. It was in one piece before I ran it over...but I didn't see anything behind me when I passed it. My tires must've grinded that poor little guy into smithereens. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! I hope you didn't have any car damage. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh man I fell down a flight of stairs at the LSU game last weekend. I was mortified because everyone laughed. <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when people laugh at me, it's so humiliating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always let drivers perpendicular to me cut in when there is a line behind me. Show some love, right? <endOfText>
<human> Yea man, that's good karma! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy I can retire. I worked for 40 years <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I hope ro retire one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't even started my new diet. <endOfText>
<human> What diet do you want to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an EDM concert that had artists that I used to listen to. It was a blast from the past! <endOfText>
<human> I have never heard of an EDM, what is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very proud of my mom when she put herself aside to be a caregiver for others. <endOfText>
<human> What does a caregiver do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my father so much <endOfText>
<human> What happened to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been hoping and praying to get my teeth fixed for as long as I can remember. I thought I had saved up enough money but it turns out it's going to cost way more than I had hoped. <endOfText>
<human> Oh what a disapointment, well you can keep saving, does it hurts too much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's where I am fortunate, I'm in no pain. It's more cosmetic than anything else so I guess I shouldn't be so disappointed over it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh ok i get it, well you just will have to save longer, thanks God its painless! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died last week. I've been so depressed without her. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you, she was pretty old so our family sort of expected it but she left so quick. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you had fun with her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not like watching horror movies. <endOfText>
<human> Same, I need someone else to watch horror movies with me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at home waiting patiently because my boyfriend said he had gotten something for  me. He came home with a small puppy and a bouquet of flowers and I was not expecting that! <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet. I want a puppy. and a boyfriend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dislike customer service agents with bad attitudes. <endOfText>
<human> oh I do too, they must have been having a bad day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my friend projectile vomit on the rollercoaster. The smell still haunts me... <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord, you might make me vomit right now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see Jeeps on the road, I get so envious! Such beautiful cars... <endOfText>
<human> They are really nice cars! Have you driven one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can you believe that for the third time in the past two weeks my lunch has been stolen at work. I am so heated right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's not cool. Did you put your name on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wet my pants in class today. I wish I could have gone home early. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Why do you think that happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. Why do you think that happened? <endOfText>
<human> I started drinking a gallon of water everyday. I couldn't hold it anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe you should slow down and only drink a bit at a time. <endOfText>
<human> I will thanks for that piece of advice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid. Those were the good old days. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you on that, man. I get nostalgic all the time. What do you miss the most? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, speaking of being a kid. You ever do something you thought was fun, but end up causing someone to get hurt? <endOfText>
<human> When I was younger, but yes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was at the store today someone always tries to cut me off and step around me so they are in my personal space and even hitting/shoving me to reach items. Versus asking me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I hate that. Sometimes people will leave their carts right in the middle, blocking everyone while they walk off grabbing what they need. So annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I got a flat tire on my way to work. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, did it make you late to work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last week when I was visiting my parents I took ride past my old high school. That brought back so many good memories. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! Could you see yourself walking around? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will always cheer for the New York Jets. <endOfText>
<human> Why? Are you from New York? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in awe of the skills of my teammate. He is true gamer indeed. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of gamer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So this guy was hanging out of a parking lot in traffic while we had a green light- No he wouldn't back up his car or GO- When we beeped at him to back up- he had the nerve to yell derogatory things and beep back as if he was doing nothing wrong <endOfText>
<human> That was very mean of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know my father will always have my back. <endOfText>
<human> That is great! Always nice to see a good dad for once <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe how great the Braves are playing. <endOfText>
<human> What's the Braves? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked across the stage at graduation. All of my family and friends were there. <endOfText>
<human> They must of been so proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the last day of work. <endOfText>
<human> Are you quitting your job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hate when my kids just throw their dishes in the sink and don't rinse them off. <endOfText>
<human> I hate that too. Have you ever noticed that's what they do in movies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you think there will ever be peace in the world. <endOfText>
<human> I wish there would be, but I very much doubt that there will. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want it to be better for my kids though. All kids really <endOfText>
<human> I do to, but there are so many unhappy people in the world and they seem to think they have to make everyone else around them unhappy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for the first Monday Night Football game. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice, I don't really watch football. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drew an art piece once and it got torn after I put a lot of work into it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was a musician. <endOfText>
<human> I sadly have no musical skill.  Do you think you will ever become a musician? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I often feel a lot of anxiety about making enough money and saving up enough money in case anything happens. And many things usually do happen. i almost panic at times with worry <endOfText>
<human> Life can be tough sometimes. It almost seems like you spend more time preparing for the unexpected than living life in the present. It's cruel sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My former 'friend' took my car for a day or two without even telling me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did you report him to the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not believe Prince died. <endOfText>
<human> Omg. I was devastated I grew up listening to him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a raffle at my church on Sunday. <endOfText>
<human> What can you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset when Michael Jackson died. <endOfText>
<human> It was really sad. He was a really good artist. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son should have graduated from high school in 2017, but he didn't. <endOfText>
<human> Why did he not graduate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a huge presentation at work this week. I have never done this before and I am not sure if I am prepared yet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, well I'm sure you'll do okay if you just prepare really thoroughly.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, well I'm sure you'll do okay if you just prepare really thoroughly. <endOfText>
<human> I still have a few days to prepare. It will be in front of a new potential client. I really hope it goes well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son spilled water on my laptop. I was so upset, because I lost all of the photos I had stored on it. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a bummer. Maybe you can take it to a repair shop. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is missing! She has been gone for almost a week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! Have you posted everywhere and checked shelters? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone I live with is mentally disabled and doesn't know how to say no...so sometimes weird men come and talk to him and they swear..and smoke on my property and throw their buts on trash my property and it makes me very angry <endOfText>
<human> That must be so frustrating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed away last thanksgiving. It is tought without her. <endOfText>
<human> Im very sorry to hear that. hopefully it will get better with time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My one year evaluation at work is coming up next month. If I score well I may get a promotion. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do well. What do you think? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have people who litter on my property constantly and throw their beer bottles and food trash- Not just kids..but older men. Drives me nuts <endOfText>
<human> Do you ever try to call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hate when I do work at work and I see non of my coworkers working. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes, I bet the bosses love them too right? That happens a lot. Very unfair <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so happy my children were born healthy. <endOfText>
<human> You are very lucky. I have 4 children and I have been lucky also to have healthy children. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is such a hard worker. She goes to high school and works full time. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Can she handle all of that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so excited and happy after my wood glue and toothpick trick worked, and it held the screw! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom said I had to get rid of our family dog because she was allergic. I cried for a week it was unbearable, I resented her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is so sad to hear! I have one dog and two cats, so I totally understand what you are going through... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was late for work the other day because of my husband! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope it was for a good reason <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I got all the way to the gym the other day and realized I did not pack my gym shoes. I had to drive home in rush hour to go get them. I was ticked. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, I would have been so upset too.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dang, I would have been so upset too. <endOfText>
<human> I would have just stayed home but I was meeting friends after on the same side of town. I had to cut my workout short. Not ideal. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just broke up with my boyfriend of 8 years. I am beyond distraught. <endOfText>
<human> I bet. You guys were together for so long. Is this for the best? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so. I wish he would have broken up with me sooner. <endOfText>
<human> Well I am sorry to hear that. If you need anyone to talk to let me know. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had good vibes all through out my final day in college i was so ready to graduate <endOfText>
<human> was? that almost makes it sound like you didnt graduate or something went wrong, did you graduate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what was major were you interested in ? I went for business management <endOfText>
<human> medicine and/or nursing, initially also liked psychiatry but then realised that its history is full of abuse and horror, some of which still is ongoing so i didnt want to participate in that. What can one use a business management degree for? Do you literally become a manager in some business or how does that work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nope, unfortunately not, i was hoping to at one point but it never worked out. What did you study? <endOfText>
<human> what was major were you interested in ? I went for business management  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job online and I didn't get approved. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, Im so sorry! They probably already filled the position and it didnt have to do with you personally! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah! People tend to be lazy and not take down the posting once they have filled the position and the automated emails will send a canned response instead. <endOfText>
<human> They should take down the posting if the job is taken. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Since last year hurricane Irma hit my area pretty hard. Before the peak of hurricane season this year I have already gotten extra tanks for my grill, a small generator and a weather radio just in case. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Did you have trouble getting the extra precautions? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever experienced a hurricane or natural disaster? <endOfText>
<human> i have <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> always wanted that tire but never had money to buy it , finally got it <endOfText>
<human> How much was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the baby ducks again in the creek behind by house and luckily they are all still there. So cute. <endOfText>
<human> how many of them were tehre <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i gave him $34 to get me the Angel Soft toiletpaper 2 huge packs and he used the money to change his oil in the car <endOfText>
<human> Well, transportation is very important.  take some old clothing and cut it up if you have to . <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would not mind but my kids would <endOfText>
<human> Tissue is so expensive, it's unbelievable <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find queuing at the supermarket very frustrating <endOfText>
<human> I do as well, how long does it take you to do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry when the Eagles lost the superbowl in 2004. I was young but I was still mad <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? Who were they playing against? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental thinking about all the great times I had as a child on my street growing up <endOfText>
<human> It's a boon for everyone. Great life period is childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The football fever ended finally. But I expect a win from Croatia. <endOfText>
<human> I know, but now we have another kind of football season coming up soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I just waiting for that curiously. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I am so excited, since the Eagles just won last year! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been unhappy with my work today. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just got a new restaurant in the neighborhood. <endOfText>
<human> what kind of food do they serve? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY son woke up at the crack of dawn this morning <endOfText>
<human> Its summer vacation. I hope you got enough sleep or it might be a long day for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant stop thinking about my grandmother. She passed away recently and it hurts to think about. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. I lost mine recently also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is about to start back. I think I'm gonna miss having my kids at home <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling, that is no fun, but at least they are learning! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my grandmother passed away, that was not a good time in my life <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you spend a lot of time with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic about the old Pokemon games, I loved playing them as a kid <endOfText>
<human> I never really got into pokemon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got lucky and hit on a lotto scratcher. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family sometimes, I just really love them a lot <endOfText>
<human> Really? Have you got a large family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Speaking of family, I love reading to my little neice. <endOfText>
<human> That must be fun, it is so cute watching kids try to read books for some reason <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just graduated college and I couldnt be happier. It was a huge accomplishment. Neither of my parents went to college. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What was your major. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter just used tape to stick a bunch of photos on her wall <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That may ruin the walls. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hopefully she learns her lesson. <endOfText>
<human> I don't know. She is 13. She may never learn anything again because she thinks she knows everything already lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Stephen Kings new show has a new episode tonight. <endOfText>
<human> What is it called? I may tune in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hopeful I will get a better paying job soon, I could really use the money <endOfText>
<human> What is you job now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was driving my sister to her friend's house today and the car almost hydroplaned because the streets were wet. Cannot believe I didn't crash into the car in the other lane <endOfText>
<human> That is really scary. Hydroplaning is something you can really do nothing about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited about my next semester at school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, you're starting up again soon, too? Me too. I'm excited and a little bit unexcited. Will be good to have a schedule, but worried about being able to do school and earn money to pay rent. What are you majoring in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> just once was i late with my payment and they charged me 39 bucks, i hate visa <endOfText>
<human> That is obnoxious, I would switch just to stick it to them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trusting of my girlfriend of almost 3 years, sheis very special to me <endOfText>
<human> Glad for you. I have broken up with mine after 3 years of being together <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once saw my partner talking to her male colleague in a coffee shop. To be honest, i kind felt mad because of being jealous <endOfText>
<human> I would be more than jealous, but maybe I am not super sane about that kind of thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devestated when I lost my grandmother, we were very close <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Did she pass away recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a wonderful holiday to Disney World when I was about 12. <endOfText>
<human> that is a perfect time to go, that is when I went as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ashamed that i used to be scared of the dark, I always had a nightlight <endOfText>
<human> Nothing wrong with that, it's the unknown that scares us all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am grateful for my family, they mean a lot to me even if they are not perfect by any stretch <endOfText>
<human> i agree on all terms, without family we dont mean much in the world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i should stop paying them, they do not prepare my lawn right for me <endOfText>
<human> That is not cool, I would cancel immediately <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was in an away soccer tournament when his cleats broke!  I had an extra pair in the trunk though. <endOfText>
<human> That's lucky!  Did he get hurt from his shoes breaking mid game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic thinking about Pokemon when I was younger, I had so much fun with that game <endOfText>
<human> that is pretty normal, so do i <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wish he could make it, i was just there alone with no one to enjoy the basketball game with <endOfText>
<human> who are we talking about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I got angry in the supermarket on saturday <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am anticipating the new super smash bros game coming out soon <endOfText>
<human> Yeah - is it a reboot of the old version from years ago? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughters are talented musicians. I'm very proud of them. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, I am very much the opposite, hat is a great skill! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am faithful to my girlfriend all the time, I wish that was not so rare <endOfText>
<human> oh, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think small things make me worried <endOfText>
<human> Small things like what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year I had to pay $300 for my daughter's 7th grade books. They are under $100 this year. <endOfText>
<human> that sure is a lot of savings <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got a smaller tv but i wanted the bigger one which my wife did not get me <endOfText>
<human> How small is small? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually give money to the bell ringers around xmas time but i did not give them any last year <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yesterday I gave an important presentation to my colleagues. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just had a track meet that he has been working so hard practicing for. He was so nervous. <endOfText>
<human> oh, tell him not to feel nervous. He worked very hard indeed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been upset at the way my daughters' school has changed this year. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i pooped my pants at disneyworld, no one suspected me but it was stinking the rides up <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is not cool, why not tell your parents? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am the parent <endOfText>
<human> Ah okay, well that makes a big difference <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devestated when my grandmother passed away, i was unsure what to do with myself for a long time after <endOfText>
<human> It can be hard. I went through that myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new Pokemon game to come out soon! <endOfText>
<human> How good. I think you like it a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really care about my brothers, our bond is closer than most I feel like <endOfText>
<human> thats what the love and family bond i think <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it s every ones right to get notified.. is it not right <endOfText>
<human> Notified of what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My job can annoy me sometimes, people always have issues <endOfText>
<human> That's always a bad thing about having to work with others.  What kind of issues do they have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt guilty <endOfText>
<human> about what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really like my brothers, they mean a lot to me even if it is frowned upon to express it <endOfText>
<human> no iam here dude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> about today's work <endOfText>
<human> Okay, I'm feeling nostalgic about my childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My childhood was mostly in the 1970s <endOfText>
<human> ok thank you bye <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was having a bad day yesterday, but my friends were there to help cheer me up. It's nice to know I can rely on people when I need to <endOfText>
<human> Friends help us in difficult times, thank God we have them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day, there was a movie I wanted to see. I invited a friend to go with me, but they decided they didn't want to come because they were going with another friend. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks... did you tell them how that made you feel?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No...I guess I should have. I guess I really think they should have went with me too, or invited me to go with them. <endOfText>
<human> I would tell them.. and if it happens a 2nd time then they arent very good friends to have! :/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That really sucks... did you tell them how that made you feel? <endOfText>
<human> No...I guess I should have. I guess I really think they should have went with me too, or invited me to go with them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my wife, she was very nervous today but still went to her interview. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That's great. Did she say how it went? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah she actually ended up getting hired even tho she was about to pass out lol <endOfText>
<human> Hired the same day though...she must have done really well, despite being nervous! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This semester is going to go great. I can feel it! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like hard work has been paying off for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last week for my birthday two of my friends flew down and I was not aware of it. It really meant a lot because I just moved to a new city. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a dentist appointment next week. I hate going to the dentist. I don't want to go. <endOfText>
<human> I went through that for like 5 years.  Ended up finally going and they've made a lot of advances in comfort since I last went before that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very proud of my daughters. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! How many do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bad surgery and I could not go home and take care of my animals and my mom did it all for me everyday. <endOfText>
<human> Are you better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> McDonalds never gets my order right. <endOfText>
<human> That is so annoying. Do you check the bag before arriving home at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a great interview yesterday. Im really nervous and cant stop thinking about it. I hope they get back to me soon. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too! Waiting for the call back is so nerver wrecking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray that I will beat my disease. <endOfText>
<human> The strength remains us the prayer, it helps us to get ahead <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to prepare before a long trip. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to go out alone or with the family? vacation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We let our tabby/calico mix cat, Callie, go outside during the day because she enjoyed being outdoors and also to get away from our other cat who persisted on bullying and tormenting her. One afternoon when she was out I happened to walk outside just in time to see a stray pit bull chase and grab her and shake her around like a rag doll until she died. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god. That is horrifying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes! That can happen around any bigger dog. We had a foster dog do it. It is horrible! So sorry for your loss. I have lost many this past year. Accidents happen. <endOfText>
<human> It's always sad but there is little you can do other than keep them indoors where they are miserable. I'm sure I'm not the only one to suffer this kind of loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I share a birthday with my cousin and sometimes as a kid I would get envious when we would get different presents of the same gift. We would get different colors and for some reason I would always want the same as her <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. Was there a reason one color was chosen for her and another for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner is away at therapy and getting help staying somewhere else so it's hard but its' for the best <endOfText>
<human> It must be hard being apart. Just know he will return a better person most likely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked really hard at studying for the SAT. I just got my scores back and I scored really high. It made my parents happy. <endOfText>
<human> Wonderful! Congratulations! What are you going in too college for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat died last week. I feel so lost without her. <endOfText>
<human> :( I am so sorry to hear that... how old was she?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> :( I am so sorry to hear that... how old was she? <endOfText>
<human> She was 23 years old. I got her when I was 5. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost her job but won $5,000 from a scratch-off ticket. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! had she ever won before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I can succeed in my business if I work my butt off every night after work. <endOfText>
<human> You definitely can! What are your plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughters are musicians, the youngest a pianist, and the oldest a violinist. <endOfText>
<human> I congratulate you on your children .... That says a lot about you as a father o mother <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I had huge plans to go away for the summer but that has changed. I failed one of my final exams and I now have to take the course over this summer. I cant believe I let that happen. <endOfText>
<human> Mistakes happen but it's good you are learning from it. We all make mistakes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently rescued a dog and she was so starved and abused I am not sure if she is pregnant or simply is having a hard time after eating plastic. <endOfText>
<human> That is very kind of you. You should take it to the vet for a check up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Borrowed my friend's car, and someone rammed her the door in the parking lot. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no... yikes have you told your friend yet?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no... yikes have you told your friend yet? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea. I'm paying her deductible for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling in such a good mood this week. Finally! <endOfText>
<human> That's nice to hear! What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for my wife, and child. I honestly dont know what I would do without them. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you have a wonderful family. Some people take it for granted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They really do.. maybe because they have never had to have it rough. We deff learn from the worst events in our life. <endOfText>
<human> I've had those experiences as well. My family is also very precious to me.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really want to lose weight, i'm sure i can do it <endOfText>
<human> You can. It will take some persistence. How's it going so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little boy won the spelling bee! <endOfText>
<human> wow! that's so amazing. I bet you are so proud of him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents are getting old and I'm worried about them. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Have you made plans on what you're going to do to take care of them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Visited my grandma, and she is still as loving as can be. Her cooking is wonderful <endOfText>
<human> Does she live far away from you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is working in another country for 2 years. I'm afraid of the people she'll meet, but I trust her. <endOfText>
<human> how interesting. What country she is at now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That promotion I was telling you about at work, well I did not get it. The worst part is that my friend did. Its hard for me to be happy for him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. I am sorry. Your time will come. That is a very hard situation! One of those hard ones in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the goats of Anarchy owner. She gave up a lucrative career on wallstreet to save goats and now other animals that would otherwise be pts or used for meat. She dedicates everything to help them. <endOfText>
<human> That is so generous. Sounds like she has found her calling in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was impressed with my friend when she finally left her ex <endOfText>
<human> Was he abusive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once lived in a hotel and was already overfull with animals and I heard a dog barking panicked in the woods one night. She was tied up in over 100 degree weather- no water, filthy, way overbred and starved. <endOfText>
<human> That is despicable.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter walked the other day for her first time! <endOfText>
<human> It has already taken its first steps towards independence, that is something big <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes it is really <endOfText>
<human> is achieved at a steady pace ... it fills us with hope and happiness <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to the rec center today after work, and it was closed. They didn't announce it or anything <endOfText>
<human> Thats a bummer. What do you do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt incredibly angry when my mom..who does everything for everyone and with a nice heart was gossiped about by my aunt until none of the family was nice to her <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What gripe does your aunt have with your mom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got promoted at work after 3 years! <endOfText>
<human> Woohoo! That is amazing. hope it came with some great benefits. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last time I was at my parents I decided to drive through my old neighborhood growing up. The field we used to play sports was still there. I cant stop thinking about how much fun we had there. <endOfText>
<human> Must have been really nostalgic. Did you think about going to play on that field again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! I've been losing weight recently and it's helped with my anxiety. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you feel great too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My tooth has been hurting for over a month and keeps getting worse. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that.  Tooth pain is something awful to have to deal with. <endOfText>
<human> Yes and I do not want to go to the dentist. I hate the dentist. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was by all of my cats sides when a few passed away this past year giving palliative care when they were so sick. I didn't give up on them until they were ready to go <endOfText>
<human> you did the right thing... do you foster them or are they yours since kittens?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> you did the right thing... do you foster them or are they yours since kittens? <endOfText>
<human> A few were seniors..others..too young but had been with me for a few years. It's been a rough year but I will always take care of them even when it's hard for me- They deserve it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im still upset really about what happened, but I should just get over it. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my wife cheated on me recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god. You shouldn't just get over it- it is not right. Betrayal is something no one should do to another. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got into her first choice school with a full ride scholarship! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! It's always nice when life works out well, especially if the person deserves it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well our police don't show up here for even gunshots or rapes but they are so corrupt they had a "blight" squad come ticket our nice car for being parked on my own lawn..that I take care of. <endOfText>
<human> That's some great police workforce your town has. (sarcasm) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been practicing speaking in front of people for 4 months now. I think I'm ready for open mic night. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome!  What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me think of the good old days when I was a kid when I listen to the music in my aunts car <endOfText>
<human> What does? Were you in a car ride with your aunt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I snooped through my friend's phone and read some questionable text. <endOfText>
<human> Is it something that commits you a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was supposed to hang out with my friend after work but turns out she has to work late <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really impressed when my boss won an award for his leadership <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Did he thank the "little people"? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has become so responsible over the summer. <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  you must be so proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a call that I won the weekend trip to New York. I've never been! <endOfText>
<human> Great, are you taking anyone with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran into a snake in the yard the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. How big was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got to the hotel where I booked my room, and it turns out they gave my room to someone else! <endOfText>
<human> What?! You should ask them for a free upgrade, because that's not cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed the sale on a laptop I've been wanting for work. <endOfText>
<human> That is disappointing.  What kind of laptop is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been able to save up money lately and it makes me feel very relieved. <endOfText>
<human> I know. Sometimes it's hard to have some left over after bills. What are you saving for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my old workplace. A lot of my coworkers were still there. I miss them sometimes <endOfText>
<human> Why did you leave? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever feel like everyone has nicer things than you do? <endOfText>
<human> Yea, but I try not to compare. It'll just make me feel bad. What about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After 40k in credit card bills and a mortgage, I finally paid it all off <endOfText>
<human> That's great.  True freedom! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new job. There's so much debt I want to clear off <endOfText>
<human> Is it a well paying one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've gotten a good deal of work done today. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. You must feel really relieved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After trying to lose weight for years, I finally got to goal weight <endOfText>
<human> Woo hoo! Thats awesome. Losing weight can be so hard! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well the other week when I was low on funds and needed my energy drinks, I found out my mom had stocked up a bunch for me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, go mom! Is she always such a sweetheart? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just grounded my son for a very long time! <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! What did he do to deserve that kind of punishment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never liked exercising, but I've finally got to exercising for a good month straight <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  I've been meaning to, but haven't had the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found 6 puppies on my doorstep. <endOfText>
<human> WOW! I just found one dog and I thought that is rough. Are you fostering them now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend down south who rescues so many animals everywhere she goes without any help. She uses all her own money and the police and AC aren't even nice to her. She goes through so much adversity and sees so much abuse- yet she keeps going with a good attitude <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like a wonderful person. People who try to help defenseless animals are really special. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let out a loud fart while eating lunch with my coworkers moments ago. <endOfText>
<human> That is hilarious! Was it embarrassing or funny at the time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After the first team meeting under new management I felt very sure that i can depend on my team <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Sometimes co-workers can be hit or miss. When you get good ones, it's awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just refuses to use the potty! <endOfText>
<human> How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Working from home now gives me the chance to be with my daughter more. <endOfText>
<human> It is great to have more time with the kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally streamed anime through a meeting. My boss wants to have a talk. <endOfText>
<human> Uhoh.  Was it work appropriate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend works, goes to school full-time and takes care of his sick mom. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I bet he is tired all the time. I drink coffee all day for energy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh. Saw a little turtle in the middle of the road and he got ran over by the time I turned around and went back.  So sad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's so sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know why they keep going across roads like that.  They are so tiny sometimes cars don't see them. <endOfText>
<human> I don't think they know where they're going. Probably just trying to get home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss wants me to babysit his daughter. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I used to love babysitting... depending on the child haha. How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to work from home before it's not as sweet as this gig. <endOfText>
<human> Oh? What's your new gig? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was singing to some old school Britney Spears. Didn't know my coworkers were still around. <endOfText>
<human> Lol. That's funny. Better hope you dont end up on YouTube. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am still single and all of my friends are married or engaged. <endOfText>
<human> Being single isn't all that bad. Are you looking for someone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend left her cactus under my care. It's been with her for 5 years. It's kinda dead now I think. <endOfText>
<human> How can you tell if a cactus is dead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am headed to the goodwill later to drop off some donations <endOfText>
<human> that's very kind. Many people wouldn't go out of their way to do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some Big Macs and Taco Bell gorditas. They were delicious <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a good lunch! I love Taco Bell <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost her job. I've been buying her groceries trying to help out. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty nice of you. Has she had any interviews? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People in my apartments can be so disgusting. It gets on my nerves. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What do they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a restaurant I go to often with my family. After all these years, they're closing down. <endOfText>
<human> That will be sad. Are you going to get to go again before then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a test last week that I had studied very hard for. I know I got most of the answers right, but I got a failing grade. <endOfText>
<human> Must've been a really difficult exam. Will there be other exams to balance it out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Heading to the buffet after completing a ton of work <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great! Any particular cuisine in mind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new appointment and I start tomorrow. I'm very nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it goes well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This girl just left her Iphone with me. She doesn't even know me <endOfText>
<human> Woah, did she say she was coming back? She's awfully trusting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its meet the teacher day at the school. I always get nervous doing this. <endOfText>
<human> Are you the parent or the teacher? I get nervous meeting anyone new <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend fell during a race, and everyone in the race stopped to help her. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice. IDid they have to start it over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything is falling into place for me. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear. What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My job is good. Kids are doing great in school, and I'm saving for a down payment on a house. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really great. Happy for ya. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just paid off the house last month. It's so nice not having to worry about mortgages. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That's a great accomplishment. I hope to buy a house soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed work to go to court the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that sucks. What happened at court? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone hit a coworker's car in the parking lot, and everyone came together to chip in for the deductible. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of them to do such a thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember a time when I actually had my entire family together for the holidays. It was really nice <endOfText>
<human> Do you guys not get together often anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my life is going pretty decent compared to the past. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! If you don't mind me asking, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got to go to the bathroom after holding it for 3 hours. Work is crazy busy sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. At least you made it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors are the worst. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spend a lot of time looking at my kds baby photos. <endOfText>
<human> Are they grown up now? They grow up so fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't gone camping in years that I don't remember what it's like anymore. Finally getting a chance to go again <endOfText>
<human> Cool. I've never been camping. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once left my wallet on a bench outside of the airport. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get lucky and some kind person turn it in <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a snake a few days ago while walking in the yard. <endOfText>
<human> OMG. I would have been so scared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always bring beer to parties <endOfText>
<human> Well, you're popular then at least. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put lipstick on before going into the grocery store the other day and when I got back in my car, I looked in the rear view mirror and my teeth were that bright red color. It looked horrible. <endOfText>
<human> Did you notice any funny glances from anyone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm doing so well right now. I think I'm going to start dating again. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great! Did you just get out of a rough relationship? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> huh? <endOfText>
<human> nothing...nevermind. work has been slow lately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been really bad at work lately. Just plain lazy. <endOfText>
<human> Why have you been lazy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School starts next week and I am all ready to go! <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! Are you taking any cool classes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend texted to come over the othe day and I lied and said I wasn't home. <endOfText>
<human> Hope they don't find out.  Were you just tired or something else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally got some yard work done last weekend. The grass was getting out of control and if it's too high, you can't hardly cut it. <endOfText>
<human> That's true. I'm glad I live in an apartment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought my dream car. I have never been so envious in my life! <endOfText>
<human> What's the model/make <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate it when your broke friends complain about being broke...then drop $100 at the club like nothing? It's the dumbest thing ever <endOfText>
<human> I really hate that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 5 years in my apartment and I have always gotten terrible neighbors. <endOfText>
<human> Does that still happen? I can relate...it was a relief to go on vacation and get away from them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Time passes on for us anyhow, and now my kids are in 5th and 8th grade. <endOfText>
<human> I dread that it will go so quickly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the time there was a friend that told me that i couldn't jump over him, then i jumped over him. <endOfText>
<human> What were you standing on? Just the ground? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Started cutting my grass the other day and my pull cord fell off and got chewed up under the mower <endOfText>
<human> Oof that sucks. Sorry about that. I dont like cutting my grass so my front door is covered in pink papers from city citations. oof <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love watching young Mike Tyson videos...watching him brutally manhandle his opponents then send them straight to the canvas face first...never gets old <endOfText>
<human> you like it a lot, now what does it do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a dentist appointment today and they made me wait over 45 minutes <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens, and they tell you to come early too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew he'd come through though. <endOfText>
<human> It is always nice to be able to rely on friends when you need them most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so stressed the other day... <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to put my dog down at the VETS office. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I couldn't imagine! I'm so sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever see kids playing and get taken back to your childhood? That happens all the time for me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah and how easy life was? i wish we could atleast have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah and how easy life was? i wish we could atleast have 1 day a year like that but to actually feel as free as them! <endOfText>
<human> What a great idea! Who do we write letters to to get that to happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant not believe my family did what they did for me ! <endOfText>
<human> Do you mind talking about it specifically? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Of course, they bought a car for me... still in shock <endOfText>
<human> haha well that's a pleasant surprise...what kind of car <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I hear the song "Walking In Memphis" I'm whisked back to vivid memories of watching "Sesame Street" with my mom in our Hong Kong apartment, fun picnics on the beach, and stuffed animals in my room...guessing they must have played that song a lot back then <endOfText>
<human> That is such a beautiful memory to have. I love that we forever have moments like this... How cool Hong Kong!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is such a beautiful memory to have. I love that we forever have moments like this... How cool Hong Kong! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks :) I had a pretty happy childhood...how bout you, do you have a song that triggers memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in elementary school I got the lead role in a play, "The Selfish Giant" based off Oscar Wilde's short novel...I was really nervous and timid at first...but knocked em dead 2 nights in a row, had parents and teachers crying and applauding it was pretty hilarious <endOfText>
<human> Some things like that you wont ever forget thats pretty rad  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some things like that you wont ever forget thats pretty rad <endOfText>
<human> Yeah you're right about that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never feel more at peace than laying at my bed in the morning. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day I was walking barefoot right? Can you guess what happened next!? <endOfText>
<human> Did you stub your toe? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish... i totally stepped right in a fresh pile of dog... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's even worse! Did you puke a little? I would've thrown up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This woman approached me on Facebook Messenger about how she is seeing my boyfriend behind my back. They work together which is how they know each other. I approached my boyfriend about this but I believe him. <endOfText>
<human> What did he say?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did he say? <endOfText>
<human> That he didn't do anything like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel mad when I hear about my friend's situation with his 2 daughters.  He's a single dad who works 10 hour shifts 6 days a week and the ex-wife collects the child support cash to pamper her new boyfriend <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty bad situation he is in. I feel little mad myself too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I played Ice Hockey when i was younger and i wasn't that great at first. <endOfText>
<human> When did you start getting better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother has been really sick. I'm taking him to his doctor's appointment tomorrow and hopefully after that I can find something to cheer him up. <endOfText>
<human> How old is he? I really hope its nothing serious :/  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How old is he? I really hope its nothing serious :/ <endOfText>
<human> 18, so he's too young and I'm hoping the same. But if it is, I will be there for him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Guess what tomorrow is? <endOfText>
<human> What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> VACATION DAYYYYYYYYYY YESSSSSS Can you tell I am ready for it or what? <endOfText>
<human> I can tell! Are you doing anything special for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the doctor recently to get something checked, always makes me worried going there. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to be okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when my brother got in trouble for no reason. My parents punished him for the wrong reasons <endOfText>
<human> That doesn't seem fair, I  hope they changed their ways eventually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you want to know something incredible? My daughter is! <endOfText>
<human> thats so sweet i bet she is how old is she?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats so sweet i bet she is how old is she? <endOfText>
<human> She's 10 and made it through first through fifth grade with all As on every one of her report cards! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having a day let me tell you.. not in a good way either. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, please tell me what's going on! Can I help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> man, when i moved out of my parents place it was such a happy feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Nice I can relate.  How old were you when you moved out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Though I've got a long ways to go I'm waking up everyday with gratitude in living life how I want, answering to nobody.  It's pretty awesome <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty great! I like it when you can wake up and not care about stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my dad got me a truck. It was a nice surprise <endOfText>
<human> Did he get it for you for a specific reason or just because? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm starting my new job soon and I'm looking forward to the better hours and pay. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will love it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad about myself <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel bad about yourself?  I am sure whatever it is can't be that horrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview today! I guarantee I will get a call back for the position! <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! I have faith on you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new city for work recently. I don't know anybody here and am just stuck by myself at home. <endOfText>
<human> I think you should get out and explore.  I'm in a similar situation--moved to South Texas with zero connections/family to jumpstart my business...and I've met some pretty amazing people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was late to work today because my doctor did not see me until well after an hour after my scheduled appointment time. <endOfText>
<human> That happen to me frequently. Did your manager said anything because you are late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager keep lying about a promotion that he promised. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  How long has he been promising you the promotion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In school, the kids would always bully me and call me names <endOfText>
<human> Why did they do tha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I could count on my brother. He was there for me when I was struggling in life <endOfText>
<human> Family is very important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is great. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my wife deeply <endOfText>
<human> Do you? You should trust her, that's what marriage is about! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have had so much rain the past few weeks, my house ended up flooding. I lost everything! <endOfText>
<human> I am really sorry.Do you have house insurance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever have those moments when people tell you not to bring certain things? <endOfText>
<human> Yes...but in what context <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Steve Irwin's death was kind of a shock to me since he was like a childhood hero of mine...that guy gave so much to the world, it's such a tragedy <endOfText>
<human> Yeah....But his daughter is doing pretty well at least almost ending up like him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend. I feel very ashamed because I got cheated on. I feel very negative and just depleted of emotion. I trusted them. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that't not your fault at all. It's your scumbag significant other's fault. You shouldn't feel ashamed for the crummy thing he did - you did nothing wrong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I did a horrible thing last night. I ate 12 buckets of KFC. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh no, are you feeling okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared when my dad had a heart attack. I thought he was going to die <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Is he better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently, my dad gave me some money to buy e-cig liquid for my vape, I am very thankful! <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool. What flavor do you think you are going to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I was putting on my cow poke boots the other day and found a snake in my boot! <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, did anything bad happen?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whoa, did anything bad happen? <endOfText>
<human> Thankfully not. My trusty dog managed to dispose of it rather quickly. Never been so afraid in my life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a restaurant last week by myself, meanwhile everyone else was sitting with at least one other person. <endOfText>
<human> How did you feel about that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aiming to have my first amateur fight this year and my first pro fight by next year at the earliest, fingers crossed <endOfText>
<human> Wow good luck, I'm a big fan of watching MMA myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spit in my coffee cup this morning and it had leftover coffee in it too. I can't believe I forgot this and drank it in the afternoon... <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I did the same thing today! I'm going to have to start making fresh cups in the morning and afternoon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to work yesterday and my coworkers threw me a party! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Was it your birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, went to the bar last night and woke up missing my underpants. I had no idea what happened to them, <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, are you okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I lied to my cousin. I mad up an excuse when I missed his wedding <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that's kinda hurtful. Why did you miss the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a very important sales pitch to some clients at work today. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park yesterday all by myself, since my friends ditched me. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, sorry about that! Did you have a pet you could take there with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a 20 dollar bill in my car and I opened my windows. I couldn't find it so I'm thinking it flew out the window... <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that's quite a large amount of money to lose. Hopefully it went to someone who needs it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey man, So i was wondering if you ever felt distrust til you met a friend? <endOfText>
<human> I try not to have any friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked in on my parents making a baby. <endOfText>
<human> Well that isn't really pleasant i bet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought 5 lottery tickets today. I am positive for the future because I think I will win <endOfText>
<human> Best of luck! Have you won in the past? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, so I was thinking maybe I would win again. <endOfText>
<human> Wow you're pretty lucky...I can never win those things <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel protective towards my little cousin, even though I wasn't actively a part of her childhood. <endOfText>
<human> Are you a mother? It could be a maternal thing/instinct. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt good and hopeful when my dad helped me get a truck. I just knew he wanted to help <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of your dad - it's sometimes hard to get a car on your own. What kind of truck is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog finally learned a new trick after months of training! <endOfText>
<human> What is the trick <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is getting old and is having trouble walking, it's tough to see. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that sucks. Everyone gets old eventually, how old is she/he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I envy people who can eat a lot and not gain weight. It's just not fair. <endOfText>
<human> I think those people don't actually eat that much, it just seems like it though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a huge 500 count bag of totino's pizza rolls last night. I managed to eat them all in one sitting. <endOfText>
<human> That seems like a lot of pizza rolls, how do you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just finished studying.  The peace helped me concentrate but now no one is around to celebrate with. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. It's nice to have friends to revel in our victories. Why don't you get yourself a beer and relax on the porch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I failed my physics exam. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  Any certain areas you think you could have done better on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning I woke up to find my 120" flat screen tv gone. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my mom died. It happened so randomly <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad to hear! How did she pass? If you don't mind me asking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting rain today because of the weather channel. Sure enough, it didn't rain. <endOfText>
<human> I love it when it rains. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went camping one weekend and I packed everything. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I usually forget a thing or two. Did you get everything you needed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like I can handle myself in a street fight if I've been sparring at least 2 days a week in the gym. <endOfText>
<human> What techniques have you learned so far though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got back from grocery shopping yesterday and I noticed that my wallet was missing. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sucks. Did you try calling the grocery store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a piece of dried poop in my closet that I had no clue about. My dog sure is sneaky <endOfText>
<human> I have a pesky, sneaky little dog like that too! Did you clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog took a fat ole poop on the carpet yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That is disgusting, my dog does that too but in sneaky places. It's always a surprise lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I invited all of my online friends in Fortnite. None of them joined to my surprise. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Maybe they were busy doing other things? Did you find anyone else to play with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to drink and shower in the lake yesterday because I lost my job. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love every year when I get a vacation and a raise. <endOfText>
<human> I love that too! Isn't it great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Long time ago on my way to my brother hockey game something bad happened. <endOfText>
<human> What happened that day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My turtle that I had for 30 years ran away yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's unfortunate. People don't realize that can happen but it happened to my friend when we were little. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have big fear of dogs. I can't explain why <endOfText>
<human> Did you get attacked by a big dog when you were little? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took leftover money from the self-checkout lane at the grocery store. I felt bad afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to go to the grocery store to give it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my aunt died. It came out of no where <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. How did she pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was a nice sunny day. I went to the park to read a book. <endOfText>
<human> I do love to read as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not expecting to win. When I scratched the last bubble in the lottery ticket, I realized I won 20 bucks!!! <endOfText>
<human> Holy moly! Sounds like you are eating well tonight! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I got into a scrap with a homeless man over a half eaten sandwich. <endOfText>
<human> Are you homeless? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need a tooth pulled and I am scared to go to the dentist. SCARED!@#!@ <endOfText>
<human> Oh, you will probably be just fine don't worry about it too much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i do some silly things at time and i feel bad at times. I went to a buffet by myself. <endOfText>
<human> Ut oh.. What did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always get nervous when I drive. The possibility of getting into a car accident is nerve wrecking. <endOfText>
<human> I hate driving, I avoid it as much as possible.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate driving, I avoid it as much as possible. <endOfText>
<human> I think it has to do with seeing a lot of car accidents when I was little. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thanks God for my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good to hear. Why do you thank god for her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't had a date in 4 years now. My last date was in high school, I'm so alone... <endOfText>
<human> Well there are always bigger fish in the sea trust me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my grandmother died i kind of lost it a little. shut myself into my room for a while. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, do you feel better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have high expectations for this new restaurant in town but my friend and I had dinner there last week and it was better than I thought it would be! <endOfText>
<human> That's always a positive in my book, what kind of food was it?  What were your reservations about the restaurant before going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker told my boss that I came in to work 15 minutes late this morning. I couldn't believe he did that to me! <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, that sounds bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I could't understand why he would throw me under the bus like that. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe it wont happen again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My zipper was down at work all day. I will not live that down <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh!  That must have been so embarrassing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend was sending her daughter on a plane to stay with me for a couple weeks. She told me she couldn't come along because the tickets were too expensive. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that sucks because money was the issue. Maybe she can take a bus or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I saw someone die today, I was so frightened. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how scary! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife up and left me last year <endOfText>
<human> Ouch! that stinks man why she do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i wanted a party when i was little for my 7th birthday i think. <endOfText>
<human> Parties are some times very loud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was let down by the movie. I was expecting much more. <endOfText>
<human> What movie are you referring too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know when you start something and you don't really see results til years later. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I hate waiting for the results of a long term goal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I lied to my dad. I just felt bad about getting in trouble <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.. what happened?  Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad.  My dog won't stop barking. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, he will stop eventually <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend is making me so mad right now.  He is on like beer 15 <endOfText>
<human> Wow, why does he need to drink so much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my friend about hanging out with someone she really hates, I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you do anything wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate being alone at my house, it's not fulfilling at all. <endOfText>
<human> Myself as well, friends are what make life better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, late at night someone stole my phone. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a smartphone? Maybe you can track it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the worst night last night. I found out my uncle hit my cat with his car. It happened two weeks ago and he never told me! <endOfText>
<human> He is a terrible person! Did he even know it was your cat? What took so long... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing expensive cars on the road is always inspiring. I am usually in awe because I know it takes hard work to get those! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of cars do you like the best? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my aunt. I wish she was still here <endOfText>
<human> When did she pass away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i am really happy now that i have a new girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure she is happy too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Those dang neighborhood kids keep egging my car! <endOfText>
<human> Do you have cameras? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get very depressed seeing roadkill when driving. Such a sad way to go. <endOfText>
<human> Have you seen any recently? It is really sad, what gets me the most is hearing about black bears being hit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I parked my car and got out. I forgot to put it to park mode so when I got out it was moving on its own for a little bit. I was so ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> Well hopefully the car didn't get damaged. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i got lost outside of my house in the woods one night. <endOfText>
<human> That's frightening. Was it dark outsside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother, dumped out all of my cards on the floor. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that stinks. What did you do in response? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I turned 30, my husband planned a huge surprise party at the beach.  It was amazing! <endOfText>
<human> I've never had a party like that myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with myself. Keep remembering 8 years of that journey. <endOfText>
<human> What journey?  Do tell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad for my husband.  He is getting a lung transplant. <endOfText>
<human> oof, that is a long healing process after the surgery. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father dropped in unexpectedly, I hadn't seen him in 3 years! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Did you guys do anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned some money to my friend at work. Turns out he quit a couple days ago and I won't be getting my money back as I have no way of contacting him.. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What a jerk for him to up and leave with no way to contact him. Was it a lot of money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> THe worst thing happened the other day. I went grovery shopping and I thought I was being followed. It scared me so bad! <endOfText>
<human> Who was following you?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i found my old Nintendo 64! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! Does it still work?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i love feeling great when i walk into exams because i actually studied. <endOfText>
<human> I know how that goes.  It can be hard to stay on track at the end of the semester. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took out the trash this morning. The trash bag ripped open and made a mess, I didn't clean it up. I felt so bad. <endOfText>
<human> Jeeze, I thought that only happened to me. Doesn't it just suck? I don't blame you for not picking it up, I can imagine how gross it must've been <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know, I find it difficult to respond to certain situations. Like when my friend's dog died, I just didn't know what to say to him. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, been there done that. You want to comfort them but you don't know what to do/say <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I laughed at this lady who fell over in the grocery store today. I'm so disappointed in myself for doing that. <endOfText>
<human> Oh poor lady. I know how it is though. Sometimes our initial reaction is to laugh even when not appropriate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After my grandma died, we had so much stuff of hers to sort through. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine. Was she a hoarder of some type? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a new restaurant last weekend! The waiter really went above and beyond with their service! <endOfText>
<human> Did you tip him well for doing such a good job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was pretty stressful at work but now its time to unwind with some binge watching of Netflix. <endOfText>
<human> I enjoy doing that after a hard day at work as well.  I hope it relaxes you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day, I was putting my groceries in my car and a friend that I hadn't seen in a while called my name. <endOfText>
<human> Did you punch him in the nose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister graduated college last week. <endOfText>
<human> Ah - that's a big accomplishment!!!  Did you get her a great present? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a little nervous. I am starting a new job on Friday <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I know the nerves can be rough, but I'm sure you're excited as well. But yea, throwing yourself into a group of new people can be rough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, don't you hate when you have a test coming up and you procrastinate studying? <endOfText>
<human> Yes.. I have a test coming up and I should be studying right now!  LOL <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got chosen to be on a TV show about comedy! <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty great! what show is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an old pocket knife returned to me that's ~15 years old. My cousin had it <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool. I know how much my husbands pocket knives mean to him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get something checked out at the doctor recently, always makes me nervous. <endOfText>
<human> What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog was my best friend, now he's gone and I feel isolated. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that. Are you thinking about getting another one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am nervous.. I have to go to court for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I have been to court before <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I have been to court before; it isn't as scary as it seems. <endOfText>
<human> What if I say the wrong thing... Or trip and fall. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my gradma so much <endOfText>
<human> I am guessing she is not with us anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So when i was a teenage my father took my game console away. <endOfText>
<human> Did he tell you the reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate having to wake up early for appointments. My biggest fear is that I will oversleep and miss it <endOfText>
<human> I understand, I have trouble waking up early too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So dude i was at my parents the other day and found something really old of mine. <endOfText>
<human> What was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just can't understand how some people can be so nasty. I go a little overboard washing my hands, but I know some people who don't wash theirs at all! <endOfText>
<human> I see people walk out of the bathroom all the time without washing their hands. So gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is really disgusting. I don't think I would ever eat at his house. <endOfText>
<human> You're telling me. I get real anxious about germs when I'm around him, lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my English exam today miserably.  The worst in class. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you aren't the worst in the class, don't say that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guarantee you have never heard a thing more vile. My best friend's husband cheated on her with his sister in law! <endOfText>
<human> That is awful. I hope she has friends and family she can lean on during this tough time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone hit my car while it was parked the other day. He even parked next to my car. <endOfText>
<human> That's unlucky, did you ever exchange information? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shopping for groceries the other day and saw someone in a dog costume, pretty unexpected. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of dog was the costume or did it look weird? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt can juggle 6 items <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool.  What kinda stuff does she juggle? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so embarrassed.  I farted while I was out on a date. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, lord. Did the other person die? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son always thinks of me when I need it the most. He's super intuitive. <endOfText>
<human> That has to make you feel so good deep inside. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I learned today that my friends wife had an affair with his brother.  I'm beyond flabbergasted. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How can someone do that to someone with someone so close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was watching a movie with our other friend the other night. <endOfText>
<human> What did you watch/? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I purchased a new router and it was DOA when it got to me today :( <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens.  Makes you want to leave things for the mailman. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my best friend.  She just had a baby. <endOfText>
<human> Are you baby crazy?  Let me guess.. 30-ish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Guess what I get to do tomorrow!!! <endOfText>
<human> Whatever it is, you seem excited. What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were stuck in traffic for over an hour due to a wreck the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That's really annoying for you but I hope everyone involved is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone has already left the office. It's oddly quiet. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you there all alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot believe that my own son would steal from me!!!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Why did he steal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a long day at work, I was surprised to find my daughter had cooked the family dinner. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of her. I'm sure that you really appreciated her for doing that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching old videos of my nieces and nephew when they were little. It really took me back.". <endOfText>
<human> A bit of nostalgia, huh?  It is always wonderful to look back on old family memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guess I'm not as liked as I thought I am. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened if you don't mind me asking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter told me I should be expecting a shipment soon. I don't know what it could be! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I love surprises like that! How exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new addition to our family was just born this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> You must be thrilled. What did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my girls were younger and playing softball sometimes I couldn't make it to all of their games. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I know that must make you feel bad, but you can't always be there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hoping to join my family for dinner but seems like I'm stuck at work <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  Maybe they can wait just a bit longer for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished the first season of Mind hunter on Netflix. I almost wet my pants. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Must be a really good show. What's it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to be off work 3 hours ago. I'm still here <endOfText>
<human> Are you working while you are at work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so guilty.  I cheated on my husband. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened to cause the cheating? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My children have started a new year at school. <endOfText>
<human> How many do you have? Are they excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my kids that there were no sweets when there were <endOfText>
<human> had they been eating too many? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No. I just wanted it for myself. <endOfText>
<human> oh, that's a cute one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I was dating to my wife she was going to a conference without me and I was afraid she was going to fall for someone else.  Needless to say I went to the conference. <endOfText>
<human> What will you do if you can't be with your wife all the time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to bring my towel and had to run naked out of the common shower area to the locker rooms. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh no!  There was no one there to offer you a towel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "My oldest girls are just over a year apart. I wasn't expecting to have another baby so soon. <endOfText>
<human> How many kids would that be now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a $1,000 scholarship for tuition. Doesn't cover everything, but it's something. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Thats amazing. What are you going to school for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently started work again and I am also picking back up my business. It is making me feel happy about the future <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything works out. That all sounds very promising! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was outside when lightning struck a tree that was close to me. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been scary.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must have been scary. <endOfText>
<human> I thought I was a goner. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to register my youngest daughter for school today. <endOfText>
<human> Was it stressful?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was it stressful? <endOfText>
<human> It maybe would have been if anyone was at the school. I really don't want her to go there but the private school had too long of a waiting list for this year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They school was locked up? I can't imagine. My first born is due in December and i'm all ready stressed about school. <endOfText>
<human> It was open and they just left flyers. I don't even know who my childs teacher is. The public schools here are trash. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have some very bad storms headed our way this evening, possible tornadoes too. <endOfText>
<human> Please be prepared ahead of time. I know that situation can be scary so it's best to be ready. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and did not have enough money to pay for my items. The person behind be paid for my groceries <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That is wonderful! I bet you were so grateful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I rescued another dog the other day and thankfully she is very calm and sweet but I was so worried when I saw her as I already have more then enough animals. <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome. Is she little or big? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love seeing all the kids excited about school starting again. <endOfText>
<human> It is always such an exciting time for them. So many new things to discover. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Checked out my old yearbook. It was so much easier making friends back then. <endOfText>
<human> Yes typically kids are nicer and more open. Adults have so many secrets and issues :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nieces pet guinea pig died yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, the poor little thing. Your nieces must be devastated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have our water pipes being redone in our corrupt city for the third or fourth time. They blocked my street and the mailman still isn't delivering and the garbage was not picked up. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes that sounds like a pain. I would dump my trash in front of city hall. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Time to make your town facebook famous or something. Shame them into fixing things. <endOfText>
<human> Oh it's flint, MI- they are very famous for being corrupt. Nothing I can do but save up to move out :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was robbed in Flint. I grew up just down the road from Fenton. You need to move. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! yes- it was good for a time but it is SO corrupt here and bills so high- I thought it was cheap no- Yes I am saving to move and working on a business too! outta here soon- it's so dangerous and it IS the ghetto. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're behind on a work project, but our boss told us not to worry about it and go home for the day. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I wonder why he was being so generous <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my friend I needed to borrow money for some car repairs but I used it for something else completely. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What did you use it on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY nest will be empty soon. I don't know what I'm going to do. <endOfText>
<human> New hobby. Maybe surfing or hiking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Your never to old. I thought my father to surf at 67 years old. Your die sitting in front of a puzzle. How about Yoga or painting class? <endOfText>
<human> Yoga? oh lord. Painting sounds fun though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Fruits have been so expensive lately, so our neighbors always brings us a basket of pears from their trees! <endOfText>
<human> That is so incredibly nice of them.  It is nice to have good neighbors...and good pears! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy with how things are going at work right now.  I just got a raise, and a promotion. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope things continue to go well for ya. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had plans with my friend to go to dinner, but I chose to stay at work to make more money <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to reschedule with your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girls went on an out of town trip and I was home alone <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Being home alone can be good though. Finally everything to yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom had to put our family dog to sleep last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is so tough. I am sorry. Are you all right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm leaving for vacation soon! I'm so pumped! It can't come soon enough! <endOfText>
<human> Yes! Vacation. Where ya headed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was born wealthy. I have to give up spending time with my family to get more hours at work in. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, that's life for most of us, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends left on a trip, but I couldn't go with them because I have so many projects to work on. <endOfText>
<human> That had to be disappointing. Will you be able to go at another time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was crossing a wet road and slipped. I fell with a thud right on my rear end <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. How is your butt now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard one of my favorite youtubers talking about the 90's the other day and how old we were lol. But it reminded me of fun times as a teen <endOfText>
<human> 90s were good time. What is your favorite memory? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend left me with her dog. Never met this little guy <endOfText>
<human> Aw! Well I hope you can help him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After all these years as a single mom, my kid is now a successful researcher. He's pretty happy in life. <endOfText>
<human> That's got to be a pretty good feeling, to see our kids succeed and hopefully do better than us. I'm happy for you! What does he research? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone ate the last piece of pizza this afternoon, when I was away all day and looking forward to eating it. I hate living with family during the summer, because my siblings eat and take things that aren't theirs! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, siblings are such hit or miss sometimes. Some get really good ones and some get, well, yours. Sorry to say. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite team has a new Quarterback. Maybe this will be a better season for them <endOfText>
<human> Who is your favorite team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a long hard day at work, I came home to an empty house. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a good thing or a bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an older mailman...around 40 and he is the kind here and he constantly writes on my mail and doesn't deliver it. <endOfText>
<human> Is he bad at his job or hitting on you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Make him Facebook famous. The Viral terrible mail man. <endOfText>
<human> I know! I just got cameras for that except I never have packages delivered here anymore because of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared today! I was taking out the garbage and a huge raccoon jumped out at me from behind the trash can! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Raccoon digging through the trash, hu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to have dinner with my family, but we're on the highway to New York it seems. <endOfText>
<human> Was this an unplanned trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Who does my neighbor think he is hitting on my wife at the block party?? <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That's a pretty low thing to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are behind on a work project, but we came in this morning and it seems like one of our coworkers finished it all by himself over night. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What a champ for doing that. You guys owe him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took so much time to finish the tree house, but we're finally done <endOfText>
<human> You must be so relieved that its done.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You must be so relieved that its done. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, the kids seem pretty happy with it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter took it upon herself to make extra money mowing yards. <endOfText>
<human> That's a really adult move on her part. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We submitted our proposal for the new project and hope we get it. It would be such a high profile project that would get us a lot of new clients if successful. <endOfText>
<human> I wish you the best of luck on your proposal and the possibility of it becoming a reality. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just recently took the LSAT and did well.  I hope to be starting law school in the spirng. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you did well and congratulations on Law School! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to be away from my girlfriend for a year, but she should know that she can trust me. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it is very hard and the jealousy can come out. I hope you have a really strong relationship though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is so amazing. I can trust him totally. <endOfText>
<human> That's so great to hear. Relationships can be hit or miss sometimes. Sounds like you got a good one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We decided not to hire a roofer and do this thing on our own <endOfText>
<human> That sounds cool.  So you are fixing it yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling down tonight.  I am broke until next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, do you at least have food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy I have a home without a landlord and can do what I want, like rescue animals. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you can do what you're passionate about.  What kinds of animals do you rescue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is visitng extended family in Canada. There's no one to come home to. Feels weird. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine. Take this time to do something for yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got caught by a train and it made me late for work <endOfText>
<human> Caught by a train? Do you mean it was late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got irritated when my brother got in trouble at school. He knew better <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i forgot the day of my brothers birthday <endOfText>
<human> Oh no thats terrible.  Did you make it up to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got him a present last minute <endOfText>
<human> That is thoughtful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im so happy today.  I just passed a really important test. <endOfText>
<human> congratulations. You worked really hard and deserved that pass! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just adopted a dog. We're gonna pick the little guy up this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Awww.. what kinda dog is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I skipped work when I was not sick. I just lied about it <endOfText>
<human> Oh, were you just tired that day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is at the doctor's, and I think we might be getting good news about a new addition to our little family. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on the kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had food, water, and a place to sleep today. I am so thankful. <endOfText>
<human> I get that so many people in the world are so much worse off then us. I think it's easy to forget that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a court date next week and I don't know what's going to happen.  I really want custody of my kids. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I really hope it goes well for you! That must be so stressful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently renovated her kitchen and I was so envious because I've been dreaming about remodeling my own for years. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you'll be able to do yours soon.  And maybe you can get some good ideas from hers! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping to become an English teacher but I am waiting on test results to come back. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are very eager to find out, good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought everything I needed for the camping trip. I was not going to forget anything at all <endOfText>
<human> Double check your list.  Camping is always wonderful but hard to come back for something you forgot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I'm dog-sitting for my neighbor right now while she's out of town, and one of them isn't acting right. They're not eating, and they seem all morose. I think I might have to take it to the vet... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I hope they're okay. How long until your neighbor gets home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke into my car last night. <endOfText>
<human> Man, that's horrible luck. Did you forget to lock it, or did they just bust in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I found a 20 dollar bill outside my house. It was not expected at all. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty lucky, did you spend it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went for a walk yesterday and stepped in some dog poop, gross. <endOfText>
<human> Lol! The real question is...was the poop fresh or old? I hate that shit, no pun intended <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new job, but I'm going to finish this last project with my current job before leaving. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I had a expedition <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This one is acting weird. <endOfText>
<human> I agree with you there. Let's just finish this one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finished my kids birthday candy tonight after they went to bed. I know there going to be mad in the morning and I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's funny. I'd tell them the tooth fairy stole it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's funny. I'd tell them the tooth fairy stole it. <endOfText>
<human> Hahahaha.  That's pretty good.  The problem is this candy is very special.  One of their friends sent it over from Europe, so I can't just run down to 7-11 to buy some more. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled my coffee on my keyboard and now it's sticky. I am so furious! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! Will you need a new keyboard now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very hopeful and excited about moving away from a very rough city and moving to a farm. <endOfText>
<human> Yes!!! I hate the city and prefer the rural areas. Are you going to get farm animals? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my finals exam last week. I am optimistic about the results but we shall see. <endOfText>
<human> At this point all you can do is hope for the best. Hopefully if you worked hard it will turn out good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a retail store and was ignored by the cashier who was checking me out. <endOfText>
<human> That's always rough, maybe she didn't hear you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid came home with straight A's! <endOfText>
<human> OMG that is wonderful!!!  I bet you are really proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My power went out over three or four times today.  I lost count. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Is it raining or something over there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY take out order today was terrible. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. What did you order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked on this project for so long, but it turns out my job doesn't even want it done anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Thats sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're going to Thailand for the summer. Pretty sure I know the language enough to guide us. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where did you learn Thai? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a list of everything I needed for my college dorm. Hopefully I am ready and didn't forget anything. <endOfText>
<human> You're moving into the dorms soon, hu? Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when my dad got me a new car. I had no idea <endOfText>
<human> That is cool! Was it a gift for any certain occasion?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is cool! Was it a gift for any certain occasion? <endOfText>
<human> I was starting my senior year, so it was for that I guess <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband had been putting in so many extra hours at work and working so hard on projects for his boss. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it will be worth it in the end <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very angry at the person who bred, starved and then abandoned (or maybe she broke free) the dog I have. <endOfText>
<human> Animal abuse disgusts me. I don't what would drive someone to do that... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a list of what to bring to the waterpark. Hopefully, I am ready and didn't forget anything. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get sunscreen and a waterproof belly bag and a hat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor brought home her baby and it was her first child. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how exciting. I bet it looks like a fat little old man. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently rewarded at work for my loyalty and dedication to the company. <endOfText>
<human> That's what I'm talking about! That sounds so nice. I'm a little jealous. Sounds like you deserve it, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, my computer monitor just died, and I was stressing about having to buy another one. But somehow my brother pulled out his toolkit and fixed it. I have no idea how people can be so handy! <endOfText>
<human> He sounds so computer-savy.  How will you repay him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Summer is almost over. I can't take it! <endOfText>
<human> Me too!! I love summer weather and vibes so much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I littered out my car window today, I am so remorseful... <endOfText>
<human> OH no. Shame of you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was confident my brother was going to finish college. He was doing so well in his major <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a very difficult puzzle from my local hobby store, spent hours on building it only to drop it when I was about to put it in a frame. I was so dumbfounded <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will get it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sickened when my friend got fired. They did not like that she was gay apparently <endOfText>
<human> Whoa whoa whoa, that still happens in this day and age? How did they even get away with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought a winning lottery ticket for $2,500 yesterday. Kind of annoyed since I know he's just going to blow it all on alcohol. I'd prefer if I could have it so I could use it to pay my rent. <endOfText>
<human> That is way too much money to blow for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car was damaged in the parking lot and the other driver took off without leaving me a note. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible! Were their any cameras? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother is sick in the hospital. I am optimistic she will make it through <endOfText>
<human> That sad. I hope she is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a new pizza place downtown. They have one of those wood fire ovens. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds delicious! What type of pizza did you order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see a happy couple, I get so envious.. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's sad. Do you have a bad relationship or not have one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sister used to live in the apartment next door to me. She was my only friend in the complex. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you, my brother is my roommate and my friend too :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see a happy couple, I get so envious... <endOfText>
<human> I know exactly what you mean. I've been single 2 years now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin is coming to town for a week and has to stay with us. I am not looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<human> Why aren't you looking forward to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my first real Italian restaurant experience today. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! I mean I haven't even really gone anywhere higher than Olive Garden myself, so I'm jealous. Did you go with anyone special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found out that I apparently filed my taxes wrong a few months ago, and now they want me to make up for what I should have paid, plus interest. I should have paid more attention or asked for help from someone I guess <endOfText>
<human> Thant sucks. I always use turbo tax.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, so does my mom. But that costs money. I was trying to be frugal and just used a free service. But I do a lot of self-employed work and I guess I didn't correctly account for all of the funds I earned over the past year. <endOfText>
<human> Maybethey will let you do a payment plan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thant sucks. I always use turbo tax. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, so does my mom. But that costs money. I was trying to be frugal and just used a free service. But I do a lot of self-employed work and I guess I didn't correctly account for all of the funds I earned over the past year.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I won 50 bucks on the lottery ticket I just bought. Did not expect it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That's awesome! What will you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father in law is coming to visit for a whole week and staying at our house! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! How long has it been since you've seen him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like vomiting when I walk into a public restroom and it smells like manure. Some people haven't had a gram of fiber in their life <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, that sounds gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was glad my dad showed me how to change a tire when I was young. It came in handy down the line <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Thinking about it...I'm 22 and still don't know how to change a tire hahah <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was proud of my brother when he finished school. He worked so hard at it <endOfText>
<human> Nice, tell him congrats. What did he major in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I actually lost that much weight. It's only been 2 months <endOfText>
<human> How much did you lose <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex is the worst. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe how big my dog has gotten. 7 months ago, she was a small, clueless puppy but now she is a big one! <endOfText>
<human> What is her name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate an entire pepperoni pizza yesterday. That is not a part of my diet. <endOfText>
<human> Don't feel guilty. We all slip sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made an elaborate dinner for my Moms birthday to show my appreciation for her <endOfText>
<human> What was the menu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is always glued to her phone. <endOfText>
<human> A lot of kids these days are addicted to technology. Does she listen to you often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave a pretty big loan to my mother in law. Today, she paid it back and I didn't expect her to. She is very hones <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Sometimes family isn't good with loans. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait to go to my aunts house. She was going to make my favorite dish <endOfText>
<human> What is your favorite dish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been in a relationship for a while now. I am so alone.. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you find someone soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter made a nice dinner tonight and she is only 13 <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like she's going to be on "Master Chef" in a couple of years. What did she make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a physics exam last week. Never felt so good going into one before. <endOfText>
<human> Thats sounds promising. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom takes care of me so much. I feel like she is Mother Teresa! <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's sweet of her! You're lucky to have her, not all moms are good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have a laundry washer or dryer in my apartment. So my mom comes by every week and picks up my smelly clothes. I am very thankful for her. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty sweet of her. Some people would find it annoying that their parents still want to baby them, but I say you shouldn't take it for granted. They just want to be in your life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I definitely over-ate today. I'm not overweight, but I do want to lose like five pounds. I also want to have positive eating habits. But eating vegetables is so uninteresting to me... <endOfText>
<human> Eating vegetables is disgusting to me so I just blend it all in a smoothie. You should try that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I hear of people doing that. And that's a useful tip. But I think you lose some nutrition that way, right? Besides, I'm too lazy to do it. <endOfText>
<human> Honestly, I have no idea. But it beats eating vegetables 1 by 1 because that takes forever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate way too much today. I feel like I let myself down. <endOfText>
<human> I hate that feeling. Hopefully you will feel better about it tomorrow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate storms so much. We are supposed to be getting bad storms tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Well at least after the storm, there will be some sunshine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe it when a rock bounced off the car in front of me and cracked my windshield. I am so frustrated at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible luck!  At least you weren't hurt.  Some insurance companies cover that as well, so you should check. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just relaxing here with a cold Dr. Pepper after a long day of work and a hot shower. It doesn't get much better than feeling the air conditioner breeze flowing on your clean body, feeling accomplished. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I love that feeling. What do you do for work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I posted a party on social media this morning. Not single soul showed up and I am alone...again <endOfText>
<human> Who did you invite? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't invite anyone in particular but it was a message to everyone on my followers list. <endOfText>
<human> Where was the party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Black Ops 4 comes out in October <endOfText>
<human> October? I thought most Call of Duty games come out in November? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Stephen Kings new show is so scary. <endOfText>
<human> I have not seen it yet, tell me abnout it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last christmas i got a car! <endOfText>
<human> Wow.Really? What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever revisit a place and wonder, since you hadn't been there in so long, where the time went? <endOfText>
<human> Happens a lot to me actually, it's sometimes enough to make me sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new movie I just saw was not great. I expected so much more. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you were dissappointed.  It is hard to spend so much money on a dud movie.  Was the popcorn good at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's ok. I bought tickets during matinee hours so it wasn't too bad. Yes, the popcorn was good as always. <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to save money, but still, it stinks.  They should have to make them good for the prices they charge. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just bought me a car for our anniversary, and I am so happy she did. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, she is a keeper. What car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A girl I asked out just rejected me. Feels bad man. <endOfText>
<human> I know you will be great in the end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Christmas eve is the worst day for me every year. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happens on Christmas eve for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a speeding ticket today on my way back from work. I did not believe it so I tried to argue with the cop, still got the the ticket. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Are you thinking about going to court for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker managed to grab the promotion that I was gunning for all year long. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's disappointing. Have you been working there longer then your co-worker? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me sad that there is only one season left of game of thrones. They could have made 2 <endOfText>
<human> My friends and family always talk about that show, is it good?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends and family always talk about that show, is it good? <endOfText>
<human> IT si the best show every created! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old playlist on my phone today. It was like reliving a moment in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Ive been there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I saw a dead possum in the road on my way home from work. <endOfText>
<human> Are you sure it wasn't palying dead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been studying for my test this Friday. I think I am ready for it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you will knock it out of the park. What is it on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kept raising my hand in class in my lecture the other day and the teacher wouldn't pick on me. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me depressed seeing homeless people. I wish I could help them but I am going through tough times too. <endOfText>
<human> You can always give them some money once you get yourself back on your feet. Just keep your head up - things will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a math test tomorrow and it is the biggest one of the semester. <endOfText>
<human> wow. I hope you have studied hard so you will do well.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow. I hope you have studied hard so you will do well. <endOfText>
<human> I've been studying all night. It's going to be a real doozy. I am quite nervous! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when I get ignored. It makes me feel less human and I get very mad! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that bothers me to.  Don't sweat it too much though.  Just consider it their loss and move on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like this girl at my job, but I am sort of nervous to ask her out. I am not very confident when it comes to those types of social situations. <endOfText>
<human> You got this bro, just be confident. I believe in you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin got accepted into Med school and I am very envious! I wish it was me... <endOfText>
<human> That is so great! Are you in the process of applying now? I'm sure you will get in eventually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I found this new recipe for mayonnaise lasagna. I'm making it tomorrow for all my fellow workers in the Nike sweatshop. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds interesting, is it hard to make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, very. But I am sure it will make a tasty meal for all my starving comrades. Even throwing a rat I found in the alley in there. Should be scrumptious! <endOfText>
<human> Did you really just say that hahaha. You are crazy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out and bought a lottery ticket last thursday. <endOfText>
<human> That's always fun. Did you win any money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just died last week. I went over to her house to help sort her stuff. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be pretty buff a couple years back. That gives me inspiration that I can get back to that shape again. <endOfText>
<human> I believe in you, man. I'm a bit rotund myself, but I started hitting the gym this past week. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I've been practicing holding my breath for a few months now. <endOfText>
<human> For what? Are you a diver or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a thunderstorm going on right now, and my neighbors dogs that I'm dog-sitting keep barking every time it thunders! They're really starting to get on my nerves. Not sure how much longer I can stand it. <endOfText>
<human> My dog does that too. I think it's the loud noises that scare them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog does that too. I think it's the loud noises that scare them. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I get that. You just figure they'd realize after the 17th boom of thunder that they'd think, "Okay, maybe it's not something to worry about." Oh well, I'm probably just expecting too much from them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to feed my dog this morning. She was acting very aggressive and I didn't know what was wrong at first then it hit me. I knew it was my fault on why she was so rowdy! <endOfText>
<human> Haha. These dogs that I'm dog-sitting wouldn't let that happen. They wake me up at 6:30AM every morning to feed them. But hey, we make mistakes. Maybe you had a busy day today. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so guilty afterwards and I know she hated me for it. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, hate's a strong word. They're smarter than we give them credit for. They know you always feed them. At the end of the day, I doubt she could have a much better owner <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I picked up this aardvark on the black market. Named him Arthur. He pooped all over my carpet yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> What is a aardvark? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to court soon for a drunk driving incident and I am so scared. What if I have to go to jail? <endOfText>
<human> You usually don't get that much jail time for drunk driving if it is your first incident. It shouldn't be so bad, but hopefully it will make you more cautious in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother is litltle sick lately. So I bought her an unexpected gift. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. Did you get her something nice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I took a big ole dookey in the bathroom at work today. Forgot to flush the toilet on the way out. <endOfText>
<human> That's gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY family got together and built my grandma a gazebo for her birthday. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice! Did she like your craftsmanship? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I interviewed at my job for a promotion. I knew I was the top candidate. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Did you manage to snag the promotion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I did. But I knew I would.I am the top worker. <endOfText>
<human> It's good to work hard for that dough. What's your new billet entail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I forgot to flush the toilet at work. The look of disgust on my co-worker's face who just walked out was priceless. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my goodness! I bet that was embarrassing. But it happens. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, it was mega embarrassing! My co-workers wouldn't stop talking about it. I'm sure they're never going to let me live it down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother last month got a brand new computer. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. What kind of computer did he get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just go through selling my grandmothers house last month. <endOfText>
<human> How did that experience go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My internet service provider cut my internet last week. I was shocked because I didn't miss the payment so I knew it had to be an error. <endOfText>
<human> I would too.  What had happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very interested in a girl that lives near me. I can't seem to muster the courage to talk to her so I'm feeling pretty down in the dumps. Hopefully, one day I can let my mind stop racing and just go for it. <endOfText>
<human> What can you lose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids just won't go to sleep at night. <endOfText>
<human> Do they have insomnia? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember being really upset when we had to move away from my very first best friend when I was 10" <endOfText>
<human> That happened to me too when I was in elementary school. I lost all my friends and had to make new ones, which sucks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent more time than usual grooming my dog. She was so appreciative and you could see how much she loved it! <endOfText>
<human> I bet she felt really special! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to pay a late fee on my car taxes because I procrastinated in paying them on time. I always put off important things because I feel too scared to do them for some reason. Not sure why I keep making the same mistakes <endOfText>
<human> Me too. I miss payments sometimes because I forget about them and I'm lazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed the payment for my utility bill but I'm optimistic about the situation. Hopefully they don't cut my electr <endOfText>
<human> Ah, so you're in the same boat as me? I can understand how that goes. Electricity is so necessary nowadays, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I quit smoking maybe twice a month. I want to quit for forever. <endOfText>
<human> Smoking is pretty bad for everyone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dogs are my entire world. <endOfText>
<human> I like dogs <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kind of scared to file for my financial aid this year. Not sure if it will cover all my expenses for the semester. If it doesn't, I don't know how I'll make ends meet and attend school. <endOfText>
<human> Can you get another job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am wishing the Yankees will win the World Series. <endOfText>
<human> Yankees fan, huh? I should pit you against my brother. He loves the Red Sox. I bet you guys would argue for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a friend to throat cancer last year. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, how old were they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> IT;s sad but I think so too. <endOfText>
<human> Sad? I am so happy, I love him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother just got a new job, and he and his family are moving into a bigger house in a nicer city. Kind of wish I had his success right now, but I'm struggling to remain proud of him too. I don't want to make it all about me. <endOfText>
<human> Have you asked him how he feels about that entire situation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every single thanksgiving, I eat alone. <endOfText>
<human> Really? That's one of the saddest things I've heard in a while. I'm sorry to hear that. What happened to your family, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little sister caught off a chunk of my hair when I was sleeping last night. She did it because I came up with a fun but mean nickname for her the day before. But that was way over the line! <endOfText>
<human> Did you do anything after she did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone spray-painted my car last night, wrote some curse word. I have no idea why, since i have no enemies. I don't understand how people can treat others like that. <endOfText>
<human> Some people are just cruel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY son always tries to unlock my ipad while I'm sleep. Now it has to be reset <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying. Kids these days are really attached to electronics, just how it goes. I know it's hard to cut them off, but have you tried managing his electronics time more closely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous when I was trying to drive where I wasn't familiar <endOfText>
<human> Did you practice first in a parking lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad Hillary Clinton didn't go to jail. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that.  I feel like Trump should have gone to jail a long time ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray every night North Korea doesn't bomb us. <endOfText>
<human> I think they are just empty threats but you never know. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved away from the city. I never see my friends anymore. It gets lonely out here. <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you move back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to order my daughters textbooks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How many days left until she starts school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had more money like Bill Gates. <endOfText>
<human> I am totally with you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really impressed that I am still able to teach my dog things at his age <endOfText>
<human> How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy school is back. <endOfText>
<human> Indeed. It would be fun to see your friends again and be around them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I had my credit card application approved with American Express. I now can think of getting a new smartphone <endOfText>
<human> How much is the phone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my dog last year, I cried so hard. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did it ever come back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so happy I gt to take my kids on two trip this summer since I started working. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish my grandma was still alive. <endOfText>
<human> Awwww  i can relate to that.  I am so sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was terrified when I heard a knock at my door late at night <endOfText>
<human> Who was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for winter, I bought a coat. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not too fond of winter, but what kind of coat did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm eagerly awaiting my son going to kindergarten. <endOfText>
<human> When does he start? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After my divorce I have no one. <endOfText>
<human> You may have more than you know but sometimes meeting new people will give you the fresh start you need <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ecstatic when my kids came home yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Where did they come from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate taking the subway, I am afraid I will get robbed. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not particularly a fan of subways either, but why are you so scared of being robbed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really annoyed when my boss was not being treated well <endOfText>
<human> So I take it you get along well with your boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently broke my favorite coffee mug that my grandmother gave me before she passed away. <endOfText>
<human> That really is disappointing.  Can you fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, it's completely shattered. I'm pretty upset. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was jogging two days ago, I fell flat on my face after tripping over my feet. Someone saw me and I felt so stupid. I turned around, looked at them, and said, "You didn't see that," and then just kept on jogging. <endOfText>
<human> Did you hurt yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cry every time I think of my grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Why do you think that is? Is it a painful or happy memory? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just stubbed my toe a few minutes ago. Why does that have to even be a thing? Something so small on your body can cause you such great pain, and all you can do is just hop around like a moron. <endOfText>
<human> It is these delicate balance of our natural body that makes us to be diligent for survival <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very special and appreciated when my supervisor praised my work in front of other team members during our weekly meeting <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was a nice surprise! That's pretty cool. What was it for, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone eat a five pound burger during some crazy challenge earlier today. It was a girl, too! Sometimes people do some wild things to completely turn around your expectations of them. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's amazing! Shows that we can't judge a book by it's cover. We automatically think it would take a large man to do something like that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Two of my best friends moved away recently not far apart from one another. Left me feeling a bit empty. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that's rough. Like a double-dose of sadness. My girlfriend and I are long distance, so I know how that goes. Is there any way you can still keep in touch with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really embarrassed when I forgot my speech <endOfText>
<human> Was it for school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to a new city and have no friends. <endOfText>
<human> That is a little daunting.  Have you considered joining some groups with like-minded individuals? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just had a baby two days ago! It's been pretty hectic, and while I'm not looking forward to having to help with diapers, I'm proud of her and happy that she's healthy. <endOfText>
<human> Aww! How sweet! I can imagine the first few days are crazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I have been together for about 14 years now and I feel we still have a great relationship. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that is fantastic! How did yall meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for my birthday <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully a happy birthday is going to be in order soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while back, we got a new guy at our office, and of course he always picks my counter to sit at. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really! Any ideas why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love doing surveys and making money. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, they can be fun I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a kitten get run over by a car. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. Did the kitten die? I hope not. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The ONE time I had my security camera off, someone stole my lawn mower! <endOfText>
<human> No joke? That's terrible. Why was the security camera off? And seriously, who steals a lawn mower? What bums. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was speeding, and another person was too. A cop pulled out behind me and luckily zoomed past me to chase after the other speeder. I felt like someone was looking down on me that day since I didn't get a ticket. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, what luck! I bet you slowed down after that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This Spring Break we decided to Ski Resort in Colorado with my college friends. It was truly special and full of exciting experiences <endOfText>
<human> I love Colorado. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not believe the summer is almost over. <endOfText>
<human> It is. Now we have to deal with rains and snows. So much to go for the next summer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad I didn't go to work today. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you decide not to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, I'm pretty upset right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good. What's wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave my dog a new food he had never tried before and he ended up puking all over my house. <endOfText>
<human> oh no that would make me feel guilty!!! Is he okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He's perfectly find, but man was it gross! <endOfText>
<human> is he allergic to that type of food? If not you need to transition him slowly! But that's funny lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really guilty when I had to leave my dog home alone for the first time <endOfText>
<human> Who did you leave him with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am honored I get to visit China next year. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great.  What do you get to visit for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked the US didn't qualify for the World Cup. <endOfText>
<human> I was too! What do you think caused it?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a little saddened to hear my state came last in education. <endOfText>
<human> What state is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, i passed by a library which me and my ex-partner used to visit frequently when in college. I felt like I truly missed those times <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. It always sucks missing the good old days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine lost 200 pounds in one year. It was amazing to witness! <endOfText>
<human> That is incredible. What a determination and dedication he must have put for achieving such a result <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visited New York last weekend, I was amazed. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I have never been! What all did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I can get the part I want <endOfText>
<human> A part in what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried all night, my brother is going back to Iraq. <endOfText>
<human> That is rough news.  How long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went over to my friends house to look at her new puppies. There were five and they were the size of my palm. I was so so happy and excited to see them, I was full of glee. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of puppies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ok making average money in my life. <endOfText>
<human> oddly enough so am I. I just want to be comfortable. How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was wearing a white jacket because I was going to a presentation and it got really dirty. <endOfText>
<human> Did you spill something on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my camping trip next weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed Introduction to Statistics class that I took as a summer class. I can't understand how i cannot even pass an introductory classes <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should take a different class. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait till Christmas. <endOfText>
<human> Especially getting gifts from family. What a special holiday this is <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, I ate a peanut butter sandwich today and it reminded me of my late grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> Awww that is sad but happy al at the same time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried I won't wake up to my alarm <endOfText>
<human> does that usually happen often?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> does that usually happen often? <endOfText>
<human> It has happened a couple times this month.  Darn iphone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so much better when i complete the goals I set for myself. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. It is always a reason to be proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband had to go out of town for work. <endOfText>
<human> What does he do for work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for the midterm elections. <endOfText>
<human> Me too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really love my wife. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful to hear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for my interview tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> What time is it at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey man. I get really nervous with my girlfriend dude. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for September. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah me too man, you like the fall? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think that is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won the lottery when I was 18 years old. <endOfText>
<human> How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait for the leaves to change color and the temperature to change. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I prefer the fall also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not believe my friend died last week. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry about your loss. How are you doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure that I will get a raise. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What makes you so confident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother calls me all the time, so annoying. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What does he do that is so annoying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I actually haven't gotten my period in two months.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Have you bought a test yet? Were you trying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish everyone would get along. <endOfText>
<human> What is the disagreement about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had a pet run away? <endOfText>
<human> Yes when I was little. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried for a week when I found out my had a miscarriage. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, i would cry as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad bought me my first car a few weeks ago! <endOfText>
<human> What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week my friend I have not seen in a couple years surprised me at my doorstep. It was awesome seeing them again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow! That's awesome that your friend unexpectedly surprised you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, wow! That's awesome that your friend unexpectedly surprised you. <endOfText>
<human> Yea I was totally not expecting it. I was so happy to see them in person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hey friend, I am so tired and sleepy. <endOfText>
<human> Tell me about it. I got like 3 hours last night <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never been able to chug a beer. I guess girls arent supposed to anyway <endOfText>
<human> you can do whatever you want!! You like beer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for my time with my grandma <endOfText>
<human> What do you do with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will get an A on my test. <endOfText>
<human> Yes you will with that attitude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The day my daughter was born was the happiest day of my life <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! You and your family must be delighted to have a new member! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking home from work at night when I accidentally stepped on a dead rat. I almost puked myself looking at it. <endOfText>
<human> I would cry, very much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get paid in a couple of days. I'm going straight to the mall <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so amazed when  the magician made my hat dissapear. <endOfText>
<human> I had to use a subway once to get to work on time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On the weekends, my kids go away and it is just me. <endOfText>
<human> Do you enjoy your free time or are you sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a nice pair of jeans at the store that fit just right. <endOfText>
<human> Cool, I have a pair of jeans. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied all week last week in preparation for my midterm, but when I got the results back, I was disappointed to see a low mark. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get sleepy while studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I take full care of my grandmother! <endOfText>
<human> I live and take care of my grandmother too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi. I feel very alone, I haven't dated since I was cheated on... <endOfText>
<human> That is understandable.  You need to let it happen naturally. Be with your friends and find yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really guilty when I got a babysitter for the kids <endOfText>
<human> did you not want to leave them with someone else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I came home to find that my dog ripped all our pillows into shreds! I was so angry that I had to punish my dog. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! How did you punish your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 22, I had a surprise birthday party! <endOfText>
<human> What happened on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for my humble life <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Some people don't appreciate anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My lights were disconnected the other day. The reason was so embarassing. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I think about happiness, the first thing that comes to mind is the overwhelming sense of bliss when my daughter was born. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's a nice story. I'm glad you have that to carry with you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to clean out my drawers today and found my old toys from when I was younger. They brought back happy memories. <endOfText>
<human> These nostalgic emotions are unique and very pleasant to have. I sometimes rewind them in my mind just to escape from my anxiety <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My college friend called me and asked if we could have a double date dinner with my and his partner. I do not know why but my partner refused <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask why your partner refused. That is very weird. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can people eat human flesh? <endOfText>
<human> I would guess that if your survival mode you will do whatever you have to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to do a presentation for school. I researched the subject and was certain that I had all my facts in order <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Did you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember as a kid when I was mad I would try to break something my parents owned. Looking back, I feel remorse for what I did. <endOfText>
<human> Tell me exactly what that was like? Hopefully it's different now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mortified when my jeans ripped <endOfText>
<human> yes i am mortified jeans ripped <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a lottery ticket and won a prize. I never win so this was unexpected <endOfText>
<human> Woah! That is great news. Have you told anyone yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyday I remind myself of how lucky I am to have a pair of supportive parents. <endOfText>
<human> You are so right. It can make all the difference. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is nice to have a roof over my head <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way. There are so many people who are struggling now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview. Everything went great and I just knew the job was mine. <endOfText>
<human> Great@  So you found out already that you got it or are you just confident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was born in January so the Christmas before she was born I had to spend alone since I was too close to her due date to travel to my family. <endOfText>
<human> ok you going to your family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little put off when I was passed over for the promotion <endOfText>
<human> That can be upsetting. Did they tell you why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another friend of mine followed through what they said they would do. They usually don't. <endOfText>
<human> That is impressive.  Why did you doubt them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Am waiting for my interview results which I did yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I hate interviews the most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too. but we can't skip this process to get job. <endOfText>
<human> Sure you can, work for yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my dad borrow 10 dollars! <endOfText>
<human> Is there any emergency need for money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter made the honor roll at school. She worked really hard this semester <endOfText>
<human> That is great1 <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to watch my nieces <endOfText>
<human> Kids are amazing. How old are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won the science fair last year! <endOfText>
<human> That is fantastic.  What for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend, I invited my friend over and we played FIFA on PS4. I won against him with a large score <endOfText>
<human> Ps4 is the best system to play on! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate losing! <endOfText>
<human> Can you be more specific about what things you had lost in the past? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a news report about the mistreatment of animals. The behavior of these people is something I can't stand <endOfText>
<human> I am with you.  It is horrendous <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved going to the diner where I grew up <endOfText>
<human> Is it still there?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is it still there? <endOfText>
<human> It is not unfortunately <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to make an out of town trip on a unfamiliar road. I was a little uneasy about it. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that.  Were you by yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We dont have a fence but I know my dog will stay in the yard <endOfText>
<human> I wouldn't be so sure of that. Even the best trained dogs can run when given a reason. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was switching around the tv channels and came across a show from my childhood. It really brought back some memories. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice.  What show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked really hard on a project at work and earned a bonus. It made me feel really good about myself <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! what was the project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think Ive seen every show on Netflix. Im waiting for something really good. <endOfText>
<human> I just got Netflix back.  What is good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds good. <endOfText>
<human> It is. They get lots of awards. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really broken up when we had to put our family dog to sleep <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Thats sad. What was wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an musical competition. one such a Musical voice is repeating in my mind from yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I could never ever sing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too, my voice is also didn't match with music. <endOfText>
<human> I can barely even talk! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole a back of chips from church once. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, What was your age when you've stolen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always eat some of the grapes inside the grocery store. I know its stealing. <endOfText>
<human> They may consider that shoplifting. It would be terrible to go to jail for grapes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran into a friend that I had not seen in years. We had a lot of catching up to do <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Are they still the same? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Gradating high school was the best day of my life. <endOfText>
<human> Did you party after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kid loves her new school and she doesnt like anything! <endOfText>
<human> Don't be daft! Kids should never watch tv! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little on the fence about letting my daughter go to a party <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the first day of my first job 17 years ago. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made an Apple pie to take to a dinner but then I ate the whole thing. I didn't bring anything to the dinner. <endOfText>
<human> I love apple pie. I feel you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter and I talk about everything. We are close. <endOfText>
<human> You are  lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You are  lucky to be able to have that kind of relationship. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it lasts she is still a teen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know this upcoming electionis going to change the state of our union. <endOfText>
<human> We will see. Don't worry so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to explain something to someone and they cut me off and would not listen <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my list all ready for the grocery store tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? What do you need to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the flat to myself today <endOfText>
<human> Cool What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry on my mom. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking for a new job. <endOfText>
<human> Ok. Had any interviews yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex boyfriend just won't move on. Its sad <endOfText>
<human> Those are the kind you better keep a watch on. You never know what he might do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work and heard gossip about a coworker. I didn't say anything in their defense <endOfText>
<human> Is the coworker your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old job was the best. I miss it. <endOfText>
<human> why <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had so many bad dates recently. I just know my next one is gonna be great. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it is - do you have any funny experiences from the bad ones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm moving to New York soon. <endOfText>
<human> How exciting for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How exciting for you. <endOfText>
<human> I think I can make it there. Its never too lare. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a movie that looked really good on the trailer but I didn't like it at all <endOfText>
<human> What was the movie? Save me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't want to say because I feel like everybody should judge for themselves. <endOfText>
<human> Well thanks for nothing lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> U despise people who wear Jordans. Ive never had a pair. <endOfText>
<human> I've never had a pair either - but I don't despise them. Why do you feel so strongly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My biggest skill is being able to bake bread. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I have never even tried. Seems complicated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im pretty happy with my new job. <endOfText>
<human> congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is still up asking me for snacks. It is 3 am <endOfText>
<human> That's a hard thing to deal with. Do you think she's really hungry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love kids. I want to give some a home one day. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have any of your own? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching the Tour De France cycling race over the last week or two <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Was it intersting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until the football season starts! I am so pumped! <endOfText>
<human> Football or soccer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hide my snacks from my kids. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you hide snacks from your kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im still pretty cool with my ex. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY neighbors are seriously having a party in the middle of the week. <endOfText>
<human> Right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be engaged. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Shame on you. <endOfText>
<human> We all make mistakes. She has been married 4 times since then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Halloween is my favorite holiday <endOfText>
<human> Is it? Do you like dressing up then? Or is it the tricks? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Disney World on holiday when I was 12 <endOfText>
<human> Did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked to the store today and didnt even have my purse. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have any money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just took a test and I'm nervous if I passed or not. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview today <endOfText>
<human> Good luck. Whats the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister always owes  me money <endOfText>
<human> Does she? Do you want me to break her kneecaps for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss having a man at home. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? I'm sorry to hear that. Are you looking for someone else? (Does that sound sleazy, lol?) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking but its not going well. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear. Maybe you don't need a man - I'm one and can confirm that they are messy, noisy and rude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the supermarket the other day. It was very busy and people were letting their kids run wild causing chaos! <endOfText>
<human> I hate that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter got an F on an exm and hid it from me. <endOfText>
<human> Jeesh, was she not paying attention in class, or is there some other issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man you would believe what my family did for me on my birthday! Big bash waiting for me at home after a long day. <endOfText>
<human> Thats cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well that explains how you knew to reach out to my family. <endOfText>
<human> Im sldo in your closet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the worst mailman. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't understand why some people earn so much money. <endOfText>
<human> I know right <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think Im done with voting. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you done with voting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You won't believe what I found when I went on my jog yesterday. A fallen baby bird just sitting on the sidewalk! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That was nice. <endOfText>
<human> Well I mean what would you do in that situation? Couldn't just leave it there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe my friend got engaged before I did. <endOfText>
<human> Well its to be expected, all you do is sit in your house on the weekends.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well its to be expected, all you do is sit in your house on the weekends. <endOfText>
<human> I do not. I dont have a boyfriend either though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend just broke up with me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh shoot! What happened, are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my girlfriend has been cheating on me. God this is the worst week of my life. <endOfText>
<human> I feel really sorry for you. Will you be okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love public speaking <endOfText>
<human> That's nice, do you get nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really embarrassed and disappointed <endOfText>
<human> oh why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because the appointment  was cancelled <endOfText>
<human> Was it an important appointment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you watch Orange is the New Black? I was sad when I saw it. <endOfText>
<human> I haven't seen it, but I know a lot of people like it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen it, but I know a lot of people like it. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah - it's a bit like an old HBO show called Oz <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find people with extendable dog leads annoying. <endOfText>
<human> What about it is annoying? Isnt it better for the dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my dog just passed away. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Are you OK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like sailing on yachts. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am disgusted that so many people voted in favour of Brexit in the UK. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I received an award at work for good performance which really made my week! <endOfText>
<human> Well done! Do you get a prize or anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I often feel lonely. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think you often feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been so frustrated today. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a lovely meal. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful, good food makes for happy people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dad told me i can't go to the party tonight <endOfText>
<human> Why not? That doesn't sound fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! is it okay to be angry at a friend when he throws you to jail for absolutely nothing? <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to find a new job soon <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job do you want? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some one took my car recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow. That's awful, I'm sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disappointed not to get a job I interviewed for. <endOfText>
<human> Wow!  Never mind, the best is reserved  for the last <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just asked my girlfriend if she will marry me. <endOfText>
<human> What did she say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On a similar theme. I have a friend who got on really well on an blind date <endOfText>
<human> That is great news.  He must be lucky. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to him this afternoon. <endOfText>
<human> really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've burn <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember my holidays as a child very fondly. <endOfText>
<human> So what  made it fondly?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So what  made it fondly? <endOfText>
<human> The weather always seemed to be good and we had lots of fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a promotion at work. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats. You must be very proud of yourself. Will you celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my cousin borrow my car. I regret doing that. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened to the car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting things done makes you feel confident <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I thinking making a list helps with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mad when I saw my ruined package I ordered. <endOfText>
<human> Did you mess on the order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was my birthday and I had no idea my friends had thrown me a party! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds amazing, good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently went to the doctor to run some tests. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didnt get any bad news from the doctor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was my nephews birthday party. Unfortunately, I missed it! <endOfText>
<human> Uhmnn, so how do you  think  she would react?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Uhmnn, so how do you  think  she would react? <endOfText>
<human> She was very sad. I felt really bad that I overslept and missed it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had a board meeting  to attend ,yet at the last hour, after delay ,it was cancelled <endOfText>
<human> That is unfortunate. You must have really angry to have wasted your time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> U can't imagine! <endOfText>
<human> It has happened to me as well. Its very annoying when it happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am angry with my friend. <endOfText>
<human> What did he do to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to the airport 3 hours before my flight leaves <endOfText>
<human> Really - are you scared of missing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The people that bring more cabin luggage than expected in the airplane are making me angry. <endOfText>
<human> That shouldn't be allowed in the first place. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently saw someone eat a week old tuna sandwich. <endOfText>
<human> What?  Was that freezed to have stayed that long?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What?  Was that freezed to have stayed that long? <endOfText>
<human> It was out at room temperature, I wanted to throw up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Waited as the numbers spinned,and finally the call, that was mine! <endOfText>
<human> What game were you playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lately, I got the best grades in my class at university. I am so happy <endOfText>
<human> Good job! A good education is great for your future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to get the promotion I was up for. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulation. Good job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately there was a fire in my garage yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my. How did that happen? I hope no one was hurt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview today <endOfText>
<human> OK get prepared!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> OK get prepared! <endOfText>
<human> I'm a bit apprehensive about it to be honest <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, can only wish you luck!  You need to be bold <endOfText>
<human> Thanks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The Olympics  is around the corner <endOfText>
<human> Is it not about 2 years away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently has my identity stolen on the internet. <endOfText>
<human> Am so sorry,  how did you handle it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset about it, I had to call all of the credit bureaus. <endOfText>
<human> That can be tiresome. I hope you had it all handled at the end <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed most of my Units in my first year of study in college. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, will you be able to stay in school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy that Canada replied to Trump by increasing taxes on some us products. <endOfText>
<human> yes it appears a trade war might happen now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily it didn't end unhappily, the dog came back <endOfText>
<human> It ran away? Better make sure can't do that again. Stressful  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It ran away? Better make sure can't do that again. Stressful <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, and it's even worse when it's not your dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Are you in the US? We have a thing in the UK called Prime Minister's Question Time which is like a debate shown on TV of our parliament. It makes me very angry. <endOfText>
<human> I am in the US. Why does it make you so angry? I've never heard about. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately, I forgot it was my wife's birthday yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that's a good way to end up on the couch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I had my neighbor's new car. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? Is it your favorite type of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found out my wife is pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. We have a boy on the way. 3 months to go! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty bad after I cheated on my Math test. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that really  bad!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, that really  bad! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I should have just studied harder. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You need to see the customized version <endOfText>
<human> The customized version of what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Car I mean <endOfText>
<human> Oh okay. What kind of car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog won't have his vitamins for his allergies now for another week because of this foobar situation. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that seems like a bad situation.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow that seems like a bad situation. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is pretty sad that I can't get what I paid for. I even contacted the seller but they never responded. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember this time two years ago when I was expecting my youngest child we didn't know whether she would be a boy or a girl. I was so excited when they told me the results were a girl. <endOfText>
<human> What a happy time I bet you were very prouod and excited!! :- <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother is the person that taught me how to cook. <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  What is your favorite dish that she taught you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really mad yesterday because my husband made a huge mess in the house. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. That sounds like me and my husband! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Leaving home makes me feel unhappy <endOfText>
<human> That makes me so sad. Why is that so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another thing that makes me sad is when someone is being racist. I saw someone being very obnoxious the other day and it was awful. <endOfText>
<human> That is a reason to be sad but also to be furious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday was last week.  It was a really upsetting day. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trusted my coworker to type up an important report but he did not. <endOfText>
<human> So did you get in trouble for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes and its all my coworkers fault. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me so mad!   I wouldn't even want to go to work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently saw a baby vomit on his mother. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty gross but it happens often. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a really expensive phone that I worked very hard to buy. Sadly, my friend dropped it and broke it. <endOfText>
<human> have they offered to buy you a replacement? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer's. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.IS she going to be under treatment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Goals are a very important part of our life <endOfText>
<human> Yes, they are. They keep us motivated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've asked my roommate to keep the smell contained but it still smells strong as we have a smaller 3 bedroom house. Part of the problems is his bed linen and clothes are always dirty. <endOfText>
<human> Have you talked to him about being a bit cleaner in general? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really good tonight after I got back from the cinema. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds like fun! What kind of film did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't go to school today. <endOfText>
<human> Do you want to do something special today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to watch over my dad when he got sick. I just felt like I needed to make sure he was going to be okay <endOfText>
<human> That must've been hard. I love my dad the most of all family members <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I shouldnt have felt the way I did but man it was hard when my daughter threw a fit at the store! <endOfText>
<human> What did happen in the store? Why did your daughter throw a fit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She was just being moody I guess <endOfText>
<human> Oh, did you convince her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little son won a trophy for the best actor. <endOfText>
<human> thats so adorable! how old is he?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats so adorable! how old is he? <endOfText>
<human> just 8 years old, I much happy about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my sister is always broke but last month she got me an expensive lawnmower <endOfText>
<human> oh cool how much was it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh cool how much was it? <endOfText>
<human> i googled it and it was around 450 bucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The worst thing happened the other day. <endOfText>
<human> tell me more about this <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter fell and chipped her tooth! <endOfText>
<human> oh my god  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son scored a goal in a football match yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Well done. You must be very proud of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, yesterday I had a board meeting which I really prepared for, but it was cancelled at the last minute! <endOfText>
<human> How did you feel, relieved or disappointed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went into the interview feeling somewhat confident <endOfText>
<human> And what happened then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I lied to my dad about missing a lunch meeting. I said I was sick and I was not <endOfText>
<human> What did you do instead?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did you do instead? <endOfText>
<human> I was hungover and lazy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was going thru things and found my dads old t shirt. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure that brought back memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it really did some of the best <endOfText>
<human> I do love those kind of memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have this vacation planned for this weekend but I am worried <endOfText>
<human> What are you worried about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was fire in my garage yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently saw a man juggling 10 balls at the same time. <endOfText>
<human> thats so cool where were you when you seen that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats so cool where were you when you seen that? <endOfText>
<human> I was really humbled.  It was at a circus. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was drunk once and completely forgot my girlfriends birthday <endOfText>
<human> that happens to everyone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i worked hard this summer to lose my belly, i was walking around the beach with confidence . I think i'm hot now <endOfText>
<human> Well done to you. Its not so easy to lose weight. What motivated you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just wanted to have some abs once in my life, no promises i will keep them <endOfText>
<human> Having a good looking body is not just to look good its also a reflection of a healthy life. You should try and keep it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been a laid back person. I never get too worried about anything. <endOfText>
<human> It's a good attitude, it keeps you young <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend. I have had a lot of problems with my girlfriend <endOfText>
<human> I've been there. That must be rough. What's going on ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so impatient and ready overwhelmed all of it! <endOfText>
<human> What are you overwhelmed by <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything honestly, I am just so ready for my future to begin. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it will begin soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really scared when a bad storm hit close to my house. I thought we could have died <endOfText>
<human> omg.. sounds terrible.. do you usually get storms like that in your area?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> omg.. sounds terrible.. do you usually get storms like that in your area? <endOfText>
<human> Its very rare, but when they do, they are bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sadly, I missed my wife's wedding anniversary <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, how did she take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently saw a hot dog eating contest. <endOfText>
<human> It must have been quite interesting. Did it make you feel hungry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so ready to go camping with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> Then?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Then? <endOfText>
<human> I packed my kit with every possible thing we could need. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Where are you camping? <endOfText>
<human> We went camping in the Blue Ridge Mountains. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He struggled  with cancer for 2 years <endOfText>
<human> Who did? And I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A Bossom friend <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry for your loss.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks! Well that's the way  life goes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats a terrible situation you are in has it been resolved? <endOfText>
<human> I trusted my coworker to give my a high standard of work but he did not. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling kind of bad about my decision to quit my job. I hope I didnt make the wrong choice. <endOfText>
<human> I see, it will be alright. You just have to be positive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I am trying I really am! ugh <endOfText>
<human> You must be feel a bit guilty, but thats okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my brother finished college. He really did deserve it <endOfText>
<human> How long did he study for?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How long did he study for? <endOfText>
<human> Over 4 years or so <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first born is going to be starting school this year, exciting! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure they will do fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes I am sure as well. I really cant wait to see what she crafts together in her first days. <endOfText>
<human> She sounds creative <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad was there for me when I dropped out of college. I knew things would be okay because of him <endOfText>
<human> That is an example of an awesome parent.  It is good to know he has got your back! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For the 3rd month in a row, I have received and incorrect cell phone bill! I feel like screaming at the customer care representatives! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my dad could help me find a new truck. I just believed in him <endOfText>
<human> Well, it is a good thing you had so much faith in your father. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Waking up super early reminds me of tournament days when I wrestled back in high school...the feeling of raw determination and hunger for victory mixed with dread, it's a pretty oxymoronic combination <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were good at it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, my boss my fired me for no reason <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I think it's an opportunity to start a new job better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I literally youtubed a how to video on taking apart and repairing a washing machine... and I repaired it for 17 dollars! <endOfText>
<human> ... I congratulate you ... it's good news! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know  right! I saved a lot of money which is always awesome! :) <endOfText>
<human> that gives a lot of confidence .... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this woman was very pretty and she was begging at the side of the road, i wanted to take her home with me <endOfText>
<human> So...what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for work to finish today. I am headed out to a concert to have some fun! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a blast. Who are you going to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its just a bunch of locals! Its going to be rad. <endOfText>
<human> That is fun, is it an inside thing or outside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor just bought this fancy car, i think its an Audi. Probably cost him 70K but he works at a call center, i dont know how he can afford that on $10 p/h <endOfText>
<human> whaaat that is insane! Alright he must be doing something really LEGAL right? lol  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No people in my area just want to out impress each other even if it means no food for their kids <endOfText>
<human> some people really are like that though. I am not one of those people tho.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> whaaat that is insane! Alright he must be doing something really LEGAL right? lol <endOfText>
<human> No people in my area just want to out impress each other even if it means no food for their kids  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really feeling at peace today with life. Its a good feeling to feel good right? <endOfText>
<human> I agree but you do not need much in life to be happy if you are a content person <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Very true, but its hard to remain so when you have so much bad happening for years in a row. Yesterday changed a lot in my life for me. I am grateful. <endOfText>
<human> i am happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbor just installed a 40k pool, i think its a waste of money <endOfText>
<human> Maybe, but maybe not. I bet it would be a lot of fun to have such a nice pool if you had the money for it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe, but maybe not. I bet it would be a lot of fun to have such a nice pool if you had the money for it. <endOfText>
<human> i thought about it but the maintainance cost is at least 4k a year for that size <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wont forget the day I found out I passed my final exam, and my dad was promising to take me out on a vacation. <endOfText>
<human> did he ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He sure did, he always kept his promises. <endOfText>
<human> you have a great dad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so on the edge of my seat. My house went under contract yesterday, and today I find out the closing date. <endOfText>
<human> wow i closed 2 weeks ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> amazing! great feeling right? god i cant wait. <endOfText>
<human> it truly is <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i dont steal but i stole beer from a store once <endOfText>
<human> were you drunk?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no sober, i was just broke <endOfText>
<human> lol well atleast you are honest!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> were you drunk? <endOfText>
<human> no sober, i was just broke  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend take my car to work today. <endOfText>
<human> hope he takes care of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He better, I am counting on him. lol <endOfText>
<human> you are a good friend,  i would never let my friend borrow mine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this bum was pooping on the matress he was sleeping on, i was flabbergasted <endOfText>
<human> that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty! ugh  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> he must have been high <endOfText>
<human> probably so either way still disgusting  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that literally makes no sense like i get it you are homeless but no reason to be dirty! ugh <endOfText>
<human> he must have been high  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had tried chatting up this cute German girl at a hostel I used to live at but she just kept ignoring me.  I thought she hated me until she just opened up one night...and let me get to second base...mind blown I've just accepted I'll never understand women <endOfText>
<human> Well, go ahead, know that women are an art, that you get many attempts <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i maxed out all my cards last christmas season, i am so dissapointed by myself <endOfText>
<human> You're not alone I've got a bunch of debt to pay off <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sometimes look back at my old, deadbeat childish self...and am so glad that I decided to man up and start making something of myself sooner than later <endOfText>
<human> i am so proud of you, keep it up  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so proud of you, keep it up <endOfText>
<human> lol thanks.  I couldn't go back to the way I was...I'd probably beat the crap out of that guy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my dad when I was younger and I hope my child doesnt do the same. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes you've gotta live with regrets.  Accept it as part of your past life and move on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying to but its hard because i was not an easy child. <endOfText>
<human> Same I've put my parents through a lot.  But now I'm trying to be the best version of myself so I can eventually pay them back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I go to bed every night expecting to wake up a better version of myself than the day before. <endOfText>
<human> that is a very positive way to think i wish i could think like you  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is a very positive way to think i wish i could think like you <endOfText>
<human> Anybody can do it, it's really easy.  Just gotta count your blessings <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset with how my rent continues to increase! <endOfText>
<human> I know, it's awful! How much did your rent go up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> another 95 dollars. it has went up 3 times in 6 months. <endOfText>
<human> Wow...You need to find a new place to live because that's completely unreasonable. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldnt sleep for a month when I first moved into my apartment. It was full of cockroaches. <endOfText>
<human> That's gross! Did you complain to your landlord? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did and it took them a month to get it fixed but they came out three times a week thats how bad it was! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's pretty bad. I would complain to someone higher up, because that's just disgusting!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never want to lose my unquenchable lust for success...I love it because it drives me, compelling me to act creatively without fear and I never want to lose it <endOfText>
<human> you sound so motivated, that's really great! I believe in you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you remember those old coca cola christmas ad with the 18 wheeler. They remind me of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> I do remember that and I think there is a lot of nostalgia there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a wonderful surprise one day <endOfText>
<human> Really! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday at work, my boss recognized me for work that my coworker actually did. I feel bad that I took credit for it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's awful. What will you do to make it right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was pregnant with my second child, I had a really difficult pregnancy. My midwife wasn't sure either of us would make it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  It seems as though everything turned our OK, right?  I am sure you were strong! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was driving down the road when this car was speeding towards me, nearly hit me head on <endOfText>
<human> Oh my!  I am glad to hear you managed to avoid the collision. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am nervous about going to the dentist's office today. <endOfText>
<human> what are you getting done <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my wife is going overseas with our baby and i'm so nervous!!! <endOfText>
<human> give her an unlocked phone  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> give her an unlocked phone <endOfText>
<human> she doesn't need it, her phone will work everywhere <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant even park where i want the neighbors keep stealing my parking spaces <endOfText>
<human> that's not nice of them. is that parking lot assigned to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I surprise myself everyday because my unbreakable focus on self betterment continues to reward me in unexpected ways". <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you're so well spoken.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Appreciate it. <endOfText>
<human> so how do you better yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, you're so well spoken. <endOfText>
<human> Appreciate it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well no softball tournament for me this weekend!  Not enough interest I guess. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe there is rain in the forecast <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got some plant fertilizer and it burned my spearmint plant. So I took it back to Walmart. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Did they replace the plant as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> remember those old AOL disc that they use to spam us with in the mail ? i saw one at a fleamarket <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I remember my parents getting them so much. Why would someone need that now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i guess its just for nostalgia and to collect. <endOfText>
<human> Possibly, but I doubt it could be worth anything. I would have thrown it out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through my childhood photo albums the other day. <endOfText>
<human> did you cry ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this pretty girl was on the train and i accidentally farted loud infront of her <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, that must have been super embarrassing. Did you get red faced? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my sister gave me $400 but i know she's always broke, i wonder why <endOfText>
<human> That seemed nice of her, maybe she felt bad about something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbors were so loud last night i didn't get enough sleep and now i feel so cranky!! <endOfText>
<human> uhhh i know how you feel!! we have some young neighbors downstairs and sometimes they have late night parties in their apartment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a wolf or coyote in my yard a while back and I think it killed a little beaver that lived in the creek  for years behind my house. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been amazing to see!  Did you try to scare it away or just watch it?  Be careful since it sounds like it may be dangerous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just purchased a new BMW after getting a large bonus! I want his cor so bad it hurts! <endOfText>
<human> That was some bonus. If you go to I think South carolina, they have a factory somewhere there and they are cheaper I think <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sometimes i steal the candy and eat it that i buy for my  1 year old <endOfText>
<human> Aw, well I'm sure a child that young doesn't really need it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very confident when I aced my job interview for my current job <endOfText>
<human> Thats good. One should always appreciate family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was, but I am livid with him, since he destroyed my car. <endOfText>
<human> That is fair, I would be as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have an old cart a 1990 corolla that made it all the way from Key west to Texas <endOfText>
<human> That is cool though, does it still run fine? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hopeful that my new degree will land me a better job <endOfText>
<human> it will <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devestated when my grandmother passed away, I still am not over that <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. I have lost all my grandparents so I know the feeling.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that. I have lost all my grandparents so I know the feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is even worse, I cannot even fathom that, I am so sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A mommy deer got hit by a car in front of my house and her two babies keep hanging around looking for her. I'm afraid they're going to go in the road like she did and get killed. Ugh. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad, humans made a huge impact on animals lives in that sense <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am content right now, I have a girlfriend, a good job, and a good group of friends <endOfText>
<human> That's great. It seems that everything is going well for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> first time home owner here, so proud <endOfText>
<human> I am aspriing to be one, congrats! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel.  I have siblings as well.  They are quite important and give life meaning. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 15 year old cat just passed away. I feel so empty and down in the dumps without him. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very lonely, that was not a fun time <endOfText>
<human> I've been there, it can really suck to be lonely.  It sounds like you're doing better though :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon <endOfText>
<human> That will be a ton of fun to play!  I rememeber when the first one came out, what a blast.  Now I have to go get a switch! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my first child was born. I was overcome with pride and happiness! <endOfText>
<human> I would imagine, that is a huge event! My favorite game was Zelda by the way <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lebron should have never signed with LA.  His home is here with us, his biggest fans since he was a kid, and his family. <endOfText>
<human> Lebron is preparing for life after basketball therefore he picked LA, he achieved what he wanted  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lebron is preparing for life after basketball therefore he picked LA, he achieved what he wanted <endOfText>
<human> He is taking away from his legendary status by switching back and forth between teams. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are pretty awesome <endOfText>
<human> Mine too.  How many do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally bumped into a guy at the mall and he dropped his phone and the screen cracked.  I felt really bad. <endOfText>
<human> maybe he was not watching where HE was going <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> neighbor cat is nasty <endOfText>
<human> Thaqt is too bad.  I like cats, but not the mean ones, only the sweet ones.  What does the cat do that is so bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I do not have any friends in my new city. <endOfText>
<human> hi, that's sad. have you tried looking for facebook events? like local events. i bet you can meet people there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, i promised myself I would never drink again but I drank yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> It is a interesting and relaxing way to end a evening. Ive been there before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really bad about it though. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.All we can do is learn from it,really. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, my dog urinated on my work documents yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, how terrible. Did you have them saved on your computer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi I was on the train yesterday and accidentally farted in front of a pretty girl <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, is it someone you like? or did you not even know her?  I don't know which is worse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard someone bumping around the downstairs of my house last night after I had gone to bed and it scared me half to death. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, did you find out who it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job a couple of months ago and yesterday i finally got a full time job!! such a relive <endOfText>
<human> That is a relief Ive been in a similiar situation.  I know its hard to bring yourself out of a hole, I can barely see the light at the end of the tunnell <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate to let people into my personal life but I got into an argument with my husband last night.  It was aweful.  I felt so small. <endOfText>
<human> i'm sorry to hear that. i hate when my wife and i argue. are you feeling any better? did you have a chance to talk to your husband after that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy to have my girlfriend of almost 3 years, she is amazing! <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, healthy relationships are the best part about life! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my body is great i worked hard towards it <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, I am trying my best these days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very lonely, that was not a fun time <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am content right now, I have a girlfriend, a good job, and a good group of friends <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! It sounds like your life is going pretty smoothly :) Any big plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yesterday after work i decided to walk to the store to get groceries and it started raining.it rained on me and i was very wet by the time i went got to the store ". <endOfText>
<human> When you feel rain ... sometimes you feel its magic ... ask the children <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i agree . but i think that will only work if i willingly go under the rain. <endOfText>
<human> you're right ... then the umbrella always at hand <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt confident when I finished my job interview for my current job <endOfText>
<human> did y0u get it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i always stole my moms money when i wasyounger <endOfText>
<human> How young were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy right now, I have a girlfriend, a good job, and a good group of friends <endOfText>
<human> sounds like your life is perfect. that's amazing. i'm happy for you <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was so full with joy <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hopeful that my new degree will help me get a better paying job <endOfText>
<human> Indeed. That is the whole purpose of getting a degree and education. Isn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy right now, I have a girlfriend, friends and a good job <endOfText>
<human> That is a lot to be thankful for!  You must be feeling really good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was digging through my parents attic yesterday and found my old Nintendo system! That sure brought back some good memories! <endOfText>
<human> Really <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt confident when I killed my job interview recently <endOfText>
<human> i bet you did and i'm sure you got the job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey my girlfriend of 5 years dumped me last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, so sorry dude. Hope your coping. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking back at my younger days, things seem a lot more freer then. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I often reminisce about my childhood.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, I often reminisce about my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> I guess I'm in a midlife crisis now and looking back to when I was more happier and realised it was when I was younger. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i think its an audi but my neighbor has an expensive car <endOfText>
<human> Audis are nice cars. What color is it? Does it look newer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting to help my cousin out in his garage. It's hard for him to find time to show me secretarial type things, so I've just jumped in and been doing it. I'm doing pretty well so far. <endOfText>
<human> that is very thoughtful of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's a family business. Our papaw started this garage in the 50s and it's the highest rated one in this city, so we stay busy. It's my dream to be a part of it. <endOfText>
<human> you are very ambitious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello friend, I am feeling very nervous! <endOfText>
<human> about what may I ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday was a few days ago and my friends planned a party for me. I had no idea! <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of them! Was it a surprise party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was prepared for Irma last year but it caught my neighborhood by surprise <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine it caught many people off guard.  I hope everyone came out ok in the end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am finally getting paid enough at work to start saving for my retirement. My future is finally looking good! <endOfText>
<human> its never too late <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving on the freeway the other day and there was a car ahead of me that was swerving bad. This really bugs me but I had no where to go on the road other then to slow down and fall back to get away from that car. <endOfText>
<human> According to my knowledge and understanding, I believe that you did something really prudent <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you. I really couldnt get too far away from the car but fortunately after several minutes of this we passed a state trooper who then pulled them over. I really wish people didnt drive so dangerously. <endOfText>
<human> Moderation in driving is important to avoid dangerous situations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I would beat my brother at all the sports games on Nintendo Wii...until he kicked my butt at boxing, soccer, tennis, and volleyball. I hadn't expected that <endOfText>
<human> oh my that must be embarresing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My local deli never has any corona light beers <endOfText>
<human> Is that your brewski of choice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my daughter, who just got her driver's license, take my brand new sports car to work today. <endOfText>
<human> oh, i bet you are nervous. I'm sure she will be okay but i would be so nervus <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, yesterday was my birthday and my wife completely forgot! <endOfText>
<human> It's alright maybe it's a working day and she has a surprise for you on saturday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I didn't pay the cab driver and he told me he need the money so badly. I feel so bad, what do I do? <endOfText>
<human> I think you should call the cab company and try to locate the driver! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I will pray as well. But try not to let it bite your conscience. <endOfText>
<human> ok, thanks buddy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am anxious about moving, I have lived in this house almost my whole life <endOfText>
<human> but that's so exciting! you will have so many good moments in your new house <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i found a dead bug in the kitchen today, it looked so nasty! makes me wanna burn the whole house <endOfText>
<human> I understand that, I hate bugs, even alive ones <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> That is very sweet. I assume you guys are close. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week we had a huge storm. A tornado blew through the neighborhood with barely enough time to take cover. <endOfText>
<human> Was your house okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon <endOfText>
<human> My boyfriend just bought a Nintendo Switch last week. It was expensive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a lost kitten and I took it to my house and cleaned it up and adopted it. <endOfText>
<human> He was dirty and I had to bathe him very thoroughly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I am content right now, I have a girlfriend, a good job, and a good group of friends <endOfText>
<human> i am so happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone outbid me on the house i wanted <endOfText>
<human> By how much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend ran away from her adopted parents. she told me nobody ever knew that they were very abusive. i feel so bad for her, i wanna help her but i don't know how <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is such a tragic thing to hear. I'm so sorry. Where did she go when she ran away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently studied for a big exam at college. Because of my hard work, I was able to pass with flying colors! <endOfText>
<human> awesome! Congrats! You make me feel so proud for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I am grateful for my family, they mean the world to me <endOfText>
<human> Blood's thicker than water, whether you like it or not <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's usually pretty good at holding liquor down and makes fun of me when I get tipsy off one mixed drink...but she's a lightweight when it comes to beer which is pretty unexpected..and I always have the last laugh <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun though, I am a lightweight, after about 5 drinks I am about out of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister talked me into going on a wild new roller coaster. I hate roller coasters! <endOfText>
<human> you should go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The warrirors are so good, they won their second ring in a row <endOfText>
<human> That is great! I bet they are thrilled! Is that you favorite team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am all alone as well.  Everyone is gone for their summer vacations. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  It's the same for me, only it's because we recently moved and I don't know anyone outside of work yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> are they alive or gone ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Robin williams was my hero i am so sad he's gone <endOfText>
<human> I know that was the case for many, I am sorry that impacted you  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know that was the case for many, I am sorry that impacted you <endOfText>
<human> i use to follow him since i was a kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I was at summer camp minding my own business when someone ran up behind me and pulled my pants down. I was humiliated. <endOfText>
<human> That has happened to me,kids are brutal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very lonely, that was not a fun time <endOfText>
<human> That makes me sad to hear.  Do you have lot's of friends now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am grateful for my life right now, I have a girlfriend, a good job, and a good group of friends <endOfText>
<human> Glad you're doing well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I'm ashamed to be a Millenial because honestly I can't stand 70% of people in my generation..they just make me sick <endOfText>
<human> Nice talking to ya <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was susprised when Nintendo announced the new super smash bros a few months ago <endOfText>
<human> I love nintendo and that series <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad had a lot of alcohol and i stole some from him <endOfText>
<human> How old were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was running late for work last week and evidently did not finish getting dressed. <endOfText>
<human> oh my thats pretty funny <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always stole my dad liquor when i was younger <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that was brave. Did you get caught? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No but i got drunk many times in the bushes behind my house <endOfText>
<human> That was pretty risky. Did you get sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i've watched a lunar eclipse the other day. i didn't expect it to look that awesome <endOfText>
<human> I saw one for the first time ever too! Where did you see it at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got in trouble for missing a lot of work. My supervisor had a talk with me and has decided to give me another chance to improve. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's good news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so pissed off at my co-worker <endOfText>
<human> Why?  What happened?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some of my kids artwork from when they were little and it made me miss having them around all the time. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling.I miss my 2 boys also <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These people would hit your car and not even leave a not and say sorry or leave their insurance info <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think people would be that irresponsible?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why do you think people would be that irresponsible? <endOfText>
<human> because they are losers <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog decided to chew more than a few pieces of furniture while I was at work :( <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Did he ruin some furniture? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is so spoiled! My parents get him the coolest birthday presents! <endOfText>
<human> My brother did too! He's the oldest so he got all the good stuff :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got thick skin and can trade crass, classless, and politically disturbing jokes all day...but if someone insults my family with malice I go livid and deny all responsibility for whatever happens next <endOfText>
<human> I hear you.  Jokes are one thing, family is another. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My power went out for 3 days last month, but I had gone out and gotten a generator right before. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were glad you made that purchase! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sick of being late for school everyday. It is all because of my sister! <endOfText>
<human> It is so frustrating when someone else's issues affect your life.  What does she do to make you late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My supervisor belittled me in front of all of my coworkers in a meeting. <endOfText>
<human> That is absolutely horrible! Was this recent? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to speak at a meeting at work and spent a week drafting up my speech. Because of this I performed well. <endOfText>
<human> Seems like this speech was very important to you, why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because it was a speech to our client about why they should stay with us. <endOfText>
<human> Ah-ah, than it makes a lot of sense. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking to get my EP out on iTunes by mid-September...I'm sure people will like it, fingers crossed hoping I get some good exposure <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was sick the other day and I couldn't afford to miss work. <endOfText>
<human> That's an unfortunate predicament to be in.  What did you end up doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently looking through old pictures and it made me feel weird. Like a longing for the past. <endOfText>
<human> I get nostalgia all the time.  Were they family pictures <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, and pictures of old friends. <endOfText>
<human> Cool.  Do you still keep in touch with those friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend called me up crying the other day. Her boyfriend is cheating on her. <endOfText>
<human> its really more disapponted and hurts a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching Back to the Future yesterday with my family. Man, it brought back some good memories of growing up in the 80's. <endOfText>
<human> yeah that good  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah that good <endOfText>
<human> It was a great feeling to think about my old friends and our shared experiences!  We loved these types of movies! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I booked a vacation next week! I'm looking forward to going <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where at <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even though I'm no longer Catholic I still put my faith in a Supreme, Higher Power because with all the dumb choices I've made in life it's a miracle I'm still here. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I've made plenty of dumb choices in my life too. Honestly, I think it's part of being young <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was miraculous that Philadelphia beat out New England in the Super Bowl! <endOfText>
<human> I know. The game was full of intrigue. They truly deserved the win <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, my partner's mom passed away. It was truly hard for her to comprehend all the mixed feelings at that moment <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that.  Losing a loved one is definitely one of the hardest things in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, at march break I went to Disney World with my family. <endOfText>
<human> sounds fun how long were you there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> okay so back in may of last year I graduated college <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I felt great after winning a video game tournament. <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool, what kind of video game was it? <endOfText>

<human> I LOVE steak..just had some steak, brisket and fajitas yesterday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old elementary school principal saved me from drowning when I was in 1st grade.  I'm eternally thankful for her and hope she's doing well wherever she is now <endOfText>
<human> thats an amazing memory to have, have you since visited her or sent her a card?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats an amazing memory to have, have you since visited her or sent her a card? <endOfText>
<human> That's a great idea but I don't know where she lives <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been studying so hard for a test and was very confident going in. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoy going to my Grandmother's house and helping out with chores and cleaning. If feels so good to help her out and make her comfortable. <endOfText>
<human> What a nice person you are! I bet she appreciates you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother moved to California a few days ago. It was stressful for him, but he's always been good at thinking things through <endOfText>
<human> I am sure the stress will be worth it in the end.  Just keep encouraging him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is my wish to not live from paycheck to paycheck <endOfText>
<human> It is a great desire that you can achieve, just rely on your abilities to independently do what you know. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think all my colleagues understood my ideas very well <endOfText>
<human> Did you present? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have lived by myself for the past 10 years. It was always just me and my dog. <endOfText>
<human> Is it something you enjoy?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is it something you enjoy? <endOfText>
<human> Well, my dog just passed away so now it's just me. I am having a hard time getting used to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car caught on fire! It was crazy and left me feeling unexplainable. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so scary! I bet you were terrified! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was bad about this because of his grandparents they would always get him something and it made it hard for me to make him understand you done always get what you want <endOfText>
<human> I'm guessing you're talking about your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my neighbor multiple times to stop their dog from barking. They leave it outside the entire day and most of the night! <endOfText>
<human> That is awful! I hate people who leave their dogs out all day. That's no life for a dog to live at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter said mommy for the first time the other day! <endOfText>
<human> that is so beautiful! how old is she?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is so beautiful! how old is she? <endOfText>
<human> She is 2. My heart was beaming I was so happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids daycare was on lock-down the other day because of a shooting nearby! I was terrified! <endOfText>
<human> that is so scary.... you must have been terrified your baby too! How are you doing today?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is so scary.... you must have been terrified your baby too! How are you doing today? <endOfText>
<human> I am better now since it is over.  I had never felt quite like that before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just got a huge promotion and her husband bought her a new house. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats.  They must be excited. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to sit with a dying dog at the rescue today.   It was sad but I felt like he deserved to be loved on before he passed away <endOfText>
<human> That is terribly sad. I volunteer at our local shelter. I just love dogs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah its hard, but its worth it.  The next week I met another neglected dog that looked like my childhood dog.  He now has an amazing home. <endOfText>
<human> That is so happy to hear! It's the nice things like that that make it worth it to volunteer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got to argue a legal case in front of the supreme court. I was very proud. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I bet that was a really big deal!  What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am astonish by Trump <endOfText>
<human> I think a lot of people are.  What in particular astonishes you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first time watching "The Sixth Sense" was when I was 10-years-old and I was nervous before going to bed or being in the bathroom with no lights...because I thought the poisoned girl with the puke mouth would pop out somewhere <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that must have kept you awake for a while! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some pictures of me when I was a teenager with some of my friends at a party and sat for ages going through them <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling.  It's a trip when I look through family albums <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Family is out of town for the week and I don't know what to do with myself. <endOfText>
<human> I would enjoy the peace and quiet!  Kick back, relax, and do whatever you want. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you heard anything from the bank? <endOfText>
<human> I have not, I was hoping they called you instead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can never get in there during the week because of work, so I have to go in early on Saturday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like good planning to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my high-school days <endOfText>
<human> I do too. I don't like to think about it because I start to feel weird. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a vacation coming up! <endOfText>
<human> Great.Did you decided were to go on your vacations? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend says she didnt tell anyone my secret, but idk how i feel about that. <endOfText>
<human> what exactly were you referring to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i think she might have lied to me but im not sure <endOfText>
<human> oh try to politely get the truth by speaking in a diplomatic manner by not hurting her ego <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my nieces softball competition and was blown away by how good she is. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really bad when I got my girlfriend sick. <endOfText>
<human> Why did she get sick? What was wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am astonished at the Russians <endOfText>
<human> Yeah me too. They are unbelievable.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah me too. They are unbelievable. <endOfText>
<human> The way they interfered in the last Presidential elections is mind boglin <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The father had no money to pay his fees so I helped him now he bought me a car <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how did he get so much money if he didn't have money to pay his fees, and what were the fees for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the first I got pooped on while changing my kids diapers. <endOfText>
<human> It must have been an overwhelming experience, how old are the kids now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt kind of irked when my friend kept bugging me for help. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you feel irritated?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why did you feel irritated? <endOfText>
<human> I agreed to help him move but he kept asking about it even though I said yyes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard in the news earlier today about a dog that was left locked in a crate on the ocean during rising tide. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad! That poor dog. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke up with my partner of 2 years about two month ago. I think loneliness is the worst that could happen to a human being <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. The only thing that helps is time unfortunately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband takes it out on me when he gets woken up and it makes me so mad. <endOfText>
<human> I think he should exercise more self-restraint when it comes to your relationship <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so good when my friends put together a party for me. <endOfText>
<human> do you act surprised ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well it wasnt so much of a surprise more planned than anything but still very thoughtful! <endOfText>
<human> did you drink a lot ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbor just bought an epensive mercedes, he likes to show it off <endOfText>
<human> How does he go about showing it off?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How does he go about showing it off? <endOfText>
<human> he plays loud music and looks my way with the windows open <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very bad about myself when i forgot my partner birthday this year. She was very disappointed in me for being careless <endOfText>
<human> Did you apologize, and do something nice to make up for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We sold our house a year ago and moved to a new one. We are very thankful for all the help our families provided. <endOfText>
<human> You should be proud of the fact you have a new home to build a lifetime of memories in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently stopped smoking after having done so for 30 years. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Congrats! I've heard that's very difficult to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really think im going to get the job! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What job did you apply for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A sales position right downtown. omg i cant wait to start <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I really hope you do get it, you sound very excited. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an item for a birthday gift from my shopping wishlist and I am excited even thought it's been 3 months <endOfText>
<human> Cool what did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I was laying with my husband and daughter and I felt so relaxed! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! I love family time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a birthday party for one of my friends kids, and a small boy asked me to get him a cookie from the table, so I got it for him. Little did I know, the boy was allergic to nuts! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so scary! What happened after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We sold our house last year and received above asking price, which was unexpected <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Did you use that extra to do anything special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 6th birthday party was unexpected.  My mom had picked me up from school and said I needed to finish homework before I could open my present.  So I went to my room but when I turned on the lights all my friends from school were there hiding and shouted "SURPRISE".  We ditched homework and played games the rest of the night. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a really fun and joyful surprise.  Young birthdays are amazing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking about going back to school, but haven't decided yet. <endOfText>
<human> I think that would be a very wise idea. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just don't know if I can handle the workload. <endOfText>
<human> Are you working a full time job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling down since my great grandmother passed. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. I know that would be hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors are so loud and inconsiderate. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to reason with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really did but they dont care it just caused more problems :/ <endOfText>
<human> You should report them to the authorities <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got a scholarship into a university that I couldn't when I was his age, i'm happy <endOfText>
<human> thats so awesome....... what uni is it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats so awesome....... what uni is it? <endOfText>
<human> Stanford :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so at peace, and in a good mood today but very stable and relaxed. Yano? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I love that feeling, you need to cherish it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really I am taking it for as long as I can because it doesnt happen often. lol <endOfText>
<human> That's good, try to figure out what caused it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating lunch at work and spilled some juice all over my pants. <endOfText>
<human> god.... did you have any extra clothes or able to change?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> god.... did you have any extra clothes or able to change? <endOfText>
<human> Nope so I just left work early haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend took me out to my favorite restaurant to celebrate my promotion at work! <endOfText>
<human> Cool congrats, what did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have done everything I can to stop my girlfriend from eating junking food. I am looking forward to her trimming down <endOfText>
<human> Trimming down on the junk food?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Trimming down on the junk food? <endOfText>
<human> on her weight. I tried to help her stop eating junk food by getting healthy alternatives and cooking for us and I also registered us with a gym <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My fiance gave our toddler juice boxes when I told him not to, simply because I knew he would make a mess. He gave him juice boxes anyway, and this morning I had to figure out how to clean up a sticky walls and tables and half of all his toys! <endOfText>
<human> Your husband is just being a good daddy  hahaha you will miss the experience when the kid grows up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well he's very inconsiderate when I am the one that has to clean up the mess. He could have just put it in a sippy cup instead. <endOfText>
<human> Then talk with him, try to reason with him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to be at home by myself for 2 days last week while my husband worked out of town. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, but being lonely can sometimes help you discover new hobbies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister got to go with my mom on vacation and i couldnt go. <endOfText>
<human> That's no fair! Where you left out on purpose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im a little "ah" about it - i dont understand why they couldnt just wait for me to get a day off to go with them. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I would be upset about that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was amazed at the orchestra I saw last week. <endOfText>
<human> what orchestra was it or where was it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what orchestra was it or where was it? <endOfText>
<human> It was a classical orchestra at a theater in town. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was dumped a few days ago after 4 years so I'm glad I have a close group of friends who helped me get through it <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad.  It sucks to end any relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm generally a calm driver.  But what really agitates me--to the point of wanting to throw something at the other driver--is someone on the right side merging at full speed onto the main road I'm driving on, towards the furthest lane possible...with NO SIGNAL <endOfText>
<human> I feel your pain. It's crazy how reckless some drivers can be. I was always taught the importance of using my signals. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while ago, I needed a place to stay for the weekend while my parents took a trip. I was lucky enough that my friend offered me to stay at his home with his family for the duration. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool I guess...do your parents not trust you in their own house? lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week on my birthday, I came home to a dark house. <endOfText>
<human> someone forget to pay the bill?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone forget to pay the bill? <endOfText>
<human> Nope. It was dark because my friends were all there hiding and waiting to greet me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wont ever forget the day my daughter said "mommy" the first time. <endOfText>
<human> I bet. That's so sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was memorable for sure <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to record the moment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife forgot to pay the car insurance, and i ended up getting pulled over! <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate, did you end up with a ticket? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yup! of course they have to get their money, and more money out of my pocket ugh <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, I hope it wasn't too expensive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the releash of the new Super Smash Brothers game. <endOfText>
<human> I havent played video games in years I really need to buy a system but I dont even know where to begin now adays lol  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I havent played video games in years I really need to buy a system but I dont even know where to begin now adays lol <endOfText>
<human> Release* sorry. I'd suggest buying a Nintendo Wii maybe, lots of good games on there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the grocery store yesterday and did something I am not proud of. The cashier gave me too much money back and when I realized it I didn't say anything and kept it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you need the money for something specific?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you need the money for something specific? <endOfText>
<human> No, I think I was just being greedy.  I should not have done it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out shopping the other day and I tripped on my shoe laces. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get my foot looked at by the doctor, always makes me nervous going there. <endOfText>
<human> I always get nervous too... never know what they will find right ! Whats wrong?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always get nervous too... never know what they will find right ! Whats wrong? <endOfText>
<human> I thought it was infected, turns out it wasn't fortunately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling so impatient this year for christmas since we are in our new home. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand, the holidays are exciting, almost there though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah they really are especially in our new house, i cant wait! <endOfText>
<human> I hope it's worth the wait! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I take care of my grandmother who lives with me and my family. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice of you. Family is great to have when you get older. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally gave my dog something he was allergic too and he broke into hives. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is really sad. You should research your dog's allergies so that it does not happen with other foods. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had good news to tell my parents, but my brother decided to interrupt me and tell them his amazing news first. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet that was super frustrating! How did you react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt it was intentional he can be a jerk sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Younger siblings tend to be that way sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm leaving for my vacation soon.  I have everything all packed and ready to go. <endOfText>
<human> Great where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very sad when my grandmother passed away. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that!  Don't worry.  I know it is hard but every day will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger I was playing basketball and I accidentally hit my sister as she was walking by. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was she okay, or did she cry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah she was fine. I made sure to apologize several times after. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, I'm glad she was okay. I once got hit in the face with one, so I know it can sting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hey man, I feel so ashamed lately <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Can I ask why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been studying for the last two weeks in preparation for my final exam. <endOfText>
<human> and how do you feel about it? Are you ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always make a list before I go food shopping, never want to forget anything. <endOfText>
<human> That is a great idea! I need to do that as well, seems I always forget something! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My supervisor yelled at me in front of all my coworkers! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope it wasn't unwarranted! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently suffered a miscarriage. <endOfText>
<human> Omg, how many months were you pregnant before this happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> had a one night stand during my last official trip. I am scared to tell my wife that a baby was birth out of the one night stand, what do i do? <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is a tough one! You have to tell her no matter what! Just suck it up and break it to her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I see petite, skinny dogs I remember Roxxie, my auntie's beautiful Italian Greyhound who died from a tumor who was really smart and could do a bunch of tricks. <endOfText>
<human> We will always have fond memories that come to our minds. I am sorry to hear that but also happy you can have the memoru.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We will always have fond memories that come to our minds. I am sorry to hear that but also happy you can have the memoru. <endOfText>
<human> It's ok I appreciate it. I know she's in a better place :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so down when i failed the test at school and didnt win <endOfText>
<human> What was the prize you didn't win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a golden medal and my name in the gym wall <endOfText>
<human> Oh well I'm sure there's always next year! Was it a fitness test or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy with my current position at work even though everyone is struggling to get posted for an international assignment I won't <endOfText>
<human> It is good you are happy with your current position. What do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a Data Engineer with a popular search engineer company :) I am happy because I want my family close to me <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I'm happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got my hair done and I've been getting so many compliments! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, it must be a very recent and trendy hair style <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so embarrassed at Trump. <endOfText>
<human> I understand a lot of people have issues with him.  What makes you embarrassed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I came home from work and found that my garage had been broken into!  They stole about 3 or 4 thousand dollars worth of equipment. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.Is the poilice helping you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sick recently and my mother made me some chicken noodle soup, so glad I have someone like her around. <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice. Moms are the best. You are lucky to have a good one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found out I am getting a pay raise at work! <endOfText>
<human> That's so good for you! Are you going to save more money now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey dude. I feel so grossed out right now. <endOfText>
<human> Do I even wanna hear it? Okay tell me... what happened? :o <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my daughter I would take her to the pool last weekend, and never did. :/ <endOfText>
<human> oh man did you forget? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I just have been so busy but i feel really bad about it <endOfText>
<human> well hopefully she understands too, you seem pretty guilty about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year when the hurricane came, we spent weeks gathering supplies and boarding up the house. <endOfText>
<human> That's sounds like a very smart and effective safety precaution. Was it enough to adequately defend your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A couple years ago, my friend died from an overdose. We were not super close but it was fun hanging out and I felt very shocked when I heard the news. <endOfText>
<human> That is really sad. Many people I grew up with have passed from overdose. It's tragic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, I thought the war on drugs was meant to combat or maybe even make ground against this. I don't think it is working. <endOfText>
<human> I don't believe it is either. I'm so sorry to hear about your friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I bought a keyboard that I was looking forward to buying for a long time. My old one kept double-tapping on certain letters. I was so happy when it arrived, I took it out of the box and I have had so much fun using it since then. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Did you buy anything else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a circus recently and was thought it was going to be boring, but it was very fun! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds cool, what did the circus consist of? Did they have elephants? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so wonderful and blessed to have an amazing girlfriend. She is very understanding, like one time i was sick and she made me soup from scratch and a tea to help my throat. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool.  It always helps to have someone helping you when you're sick. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom's restaurant pics on Facebook give me a mixed feeling of nostalgia, guilt, and fond memories. My brother and I are usually part of their weekend restaurant excursions but we are both out of state doing our own thing <endOfText>
<human> oh man, do you miss it? How about your brother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I confronted a cashier the other day about over charging me but it turns out that I was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch!  That had to feel embarrassing!  Did you apologize? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did profusely! <endOfText>
<human> That's good.  That shows your true character. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my friend in a car accident. It has been very sad news. <endOfText>
<human> That's sucks. You must have been devastated when you got the news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at the republicans. <endOfText>
<human> I am too actually. I don't care for them at all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My doctor recently talked me through a very complicated and scary procedure. <endOfText>
<human> Are you ok? How is your recovery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend I was dragged to a live piano performance at a local concert hall.  I came away thinking it might have been one of the best live shows I have ever seen! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, from the sound of it, your probably thought it was going to be boring, huh? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never finished school. I had problems with my mental health and just stopped showing up to class. It was very hard for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, are you feeling any better now? Or are you still having problems? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently invested pretty heavily into cryptocurrency. I'm anxiously awaiting to see if it pays off! <endOfText>
<human> That is very risky and volatile!  With no risk, there is no reward!  I am rooting for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece got her license last week! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I bet she's never home now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy for my daughter. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy to hear that! Any specific reasons? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to make a new dish last night for dinner, but when it tasted to gross I had to throw it out. <endOfText>
<human> That could happen to anyone.Don't feel so bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really happy and appreciative <endOfText>
<human> what about friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on a road trip so later today I have to buy stuff for sandwiches, waters, snacks, I have even made a list. I think I am really ready for this. <endOfText>
<human> That's good launch you gat tere  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's good launch you gat tere <endOfText>
<human> yeah I think so too, I am not very well off so I won't be able to buy food a lot so that's what I will be eating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was at work and my friend wouldn't help do any of the work! the entire day she just sat there and talked, I was so mad at her. I practically did all the work that day <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that sucks. You may need to say something to her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man, that sucks. You may need to say something to her. <endOfText>
<human> I did, and she said that she was going to change. i just hope that she wasn't just saying something to get rid of me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I invited my mom out to dinner the other night, because we haven't seen other in a while. I was all willing to pay, since I invited her, but she stole the check and paid for it instead. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That must've been a surprise  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was! I thanked her and said that I could get it next time we went out. <endOfText>
<human> She must've really enjoyed the time. Where did you guys go out to eat? Was it nice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! That must've been a surprise <endOfText>
<human> It was! I thanked her and said that I could get it next time we went out.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend, I won $2500 playing roulette at the casino! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is a lot of money! Congrats! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently flew for the first time on an airplane! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That must have been exciting. Were you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad after my partner discovered that i was cheating him <endOfText>
<human> Well, you should.You did a nasty thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on the phone with my bank about some overdraft charges that were charged because of their error. I am still angry about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible! I hope it wasn't a lot of money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I witnessed a man rob an old woman walking across the street. Boils my friggin' blood! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my God that's terrible!  So sad.  I'd be mad too.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would have chased that punk down if I was close enough, but I saw it from a distance. <endOfText>
<human> Did the police come? I hope she got her stuff back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is so lucky adn sso good at design, she has the prettiest nursery set up for her daughter!  My kids were lucky to have a matching crib bed set lol <endOfText>
<human> That's cool! It's nice to have someone close that is talented like that and can help with those things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next week Madden 19 comes out, I look forward to it every year! <endOfText>
<human> I used to play Madden a lot so I understand the excitement.  It is a fun game <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through my attic this weekend for stuff to donate to the local shelter and I came across a box with all of my old baseball gear.  It really brought back memories <endOfText>
<human> I used to collect too when I was a kid, I still have some but they are probably worth nothing other than nostalgia. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my college days, it was pure fun. <endOfText>
<human> College in general tends to be a lot of fun.  Anything in particular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am irritated at people who smoke near me at work. It turns one into a second hand smoker <endOfText>
<human> Why can't you just move away when they smoke? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend at work recently left the job to start her nursing career. <endOfText>
<human> Have you heard how she's doing at her new job?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you heard how she's doing at her new job? <endOfText>
<human> She's doing well. I was so emotional with her leaving. I feel a lot of sentiment about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other night, the sky got really dark and it started raining really heavy and hailing. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds ominous! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was! I wasn't expecting a storm. The power went out. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds scary! I hope it all ended okay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Right before going into work, I spilled my drink all over my pants. Looks like I peed! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I hate when that happens...did you dry it off or change to a new pair? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started my own business, here's to hoping it goes well! <endOfText>
<human> How fun! That must have been scary to do that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey there bud, how's it goig? <endOfText>
<human> Not very good. My insurance might not cover the damages. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always make a list before i buy groceries, never forget anything that way. <endOfText>
<human> That is impressive.You must have a super memory. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my grandparents so much it hurts. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, do you have positive memories that you can remember them with at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone made a huge mess in the microwave in the break room and didn't clean it up. <endOfText>
<human> oh, sorry to hear this. you just want to make it up clean soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want whoever made the mess to clean it up. <endOfText>
<human> you have to find the person who did this.then you should made the mess to clean it up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like if there's one thing equal to if not greater than sex it's seeing all my bills paid, debt nonexistent, income far greater than expenses and a nice fat check from tax returns at the end of the year. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, man. Almost nothing feels as good as financial security. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hurricane season is right around the corner. Time to get prepared. <endOfText>
<human> What do you do to get prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i promised my wife that i will stop drinking but it seems hard to stop, i feel so bad <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you could try AA meetings or suggest to your wife that she can go to Al Anon meetings. It's a good first start. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband's socks and underwear are all over the house! <endOfText>
<human> Talk to him wisely <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger, I used to always watch my dad's softball games. Recently, he played in a game with his old buddies. It brought back so many memories of the old days. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I have so many fond memories of playing ball in the yard with my dad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got into his first choice college! It was quite surprising <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! I bet he was elated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a job interview! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so happy? What was the job you got a interview for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm considering leaving my wife for my nanny because she seems more interested in my than my wife <endOfText>
<human> Thing very carrefully before making this important decision. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thank God everyday for the wife I have <endOfText>
<human> You must be taking good care of her in and out if you know what I mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but she actually takes even better care of me and that is why i am so grateful <endOfText>
<human> I hope you can make her realize how grateful you are by being faithful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been with my wife for over 10 years and have always been dedicated to her. I can't understand why some people cheat. <endOfText>
<human> Oh me neither! I don't like a cheater! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard my favorite childhood song the other day! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What song is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent many years taking care of my grandmother. Those are great memories! <endOfText>
<human> That is great, but I take she is not alive anymore?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sad these days because the way president Trumps acts. <endOfText>
<human> I would have to agree with you there. I don't trust him at all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm about to move out of state all by myself. It makes me so nervous <endOfText>
<human> You'll be fine. It will be a great learning experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi there. Did you do anything fun for the 4th of July? I went kayaking and hit some pretty heavy rapids. I had trouble with them, but the friend I was with did not. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome.  Do you go kayaking often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As often as I can. I don't get to enough. It's hard to get away from work. <endOfText>
<human> Do you own your own kayak or do you rent? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just replaced my headlights in my truck and one of them went out inside of a week. <endOfText>
<human> That's very irritating! Is it difficult to change the headlights in your truck? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's not but its a pain in the neck and $35 <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that shouldn't happen. I hate changing the headlights on my car. They made it really tough to get to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the gym this morning with my friend and watched him jump rope for an hour straight without stopping <endOfText>
<human> Seems incredible but also kind of boring at the same time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy for my son. <endOfText>
<human> What did your son do that makes you so happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband actually did the laundry last night. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you.It looks he is making an effort. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won $20 in a shooting competition with my friends, and a lot of bragging rights. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats.I bet they were very impress with you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, did you ever have an experience like mine? One where you have stepped into the dog poo? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, It feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, It feels disgusting and you want to throw your shoe away afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, did you ever do it in the barefooting. This is how I did it recently. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been really down lately. I recently lost a close family member. <endOfText>
<human> That would be tough. Have you found a support group to go too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, it isn't that bad. It's just grief of losing my grandmother. She was 93 and lived a very full and exciting life. It's just hard to know she is no longer here. <endOfText>
<human> That would be difficult! I can't imagine the pain you must be going through. Sounds like ya'll have good memories together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We did. She always had her own garden and taught me all kinds of skills related to farming, preparing, and canning food. She was an awesome person. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great gandma! You are so blessed to have those memories with her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. I agree. I will miss her, but I will always have her spirit with me. <endOfText>
<human> My mom thinks that her grandma's spirit is in me, because she died right before I was born. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I got married I had to board my dog at the vet, I felt so awful about it! <endOfText>
<human> really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog I've had since I was a kid died a few days ago. It makes me very sad <endOfText>
<human> oh my god, it's like a most heartbroken moment of me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> because in my family is very innocent about all (ex:to handle the regular work and school) still i am to rained in my family and me also learn about that <endOfText>
<human> I'm not quite sure what you are telling me, but handling work and school is certainly hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel abandon these days. <endOfText>
<human> Whats wrong? Did anything happen? Have you reached out to any friends lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe the state of our politics in America. <endOfText>
<human> Can we use the "broken" to describe our political system?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can we use the "broken" to describe our political system? <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely. Things have gotten so crazy that's it's almost pointless to engage others in objective discussion. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I went back to work I felt very uneasy about taking my infant to daycare. I was so upset and worried. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you.I had the same feeling when I first left my child on day-care  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel you.I had the same feeling when I first left my child on day-care <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you understand. I would panic at work, I couldn't relax! I ended up deciding to stay home with him full time after just three weeks back at work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling very apprehensive these days. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, is there something in particular that's bothering you the most? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am kind of mad at one of my co-workers <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Why are you mad at them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was giving a presentation at work in front of upper management the other day. I forgot what I was talking about, started sweating and turned bright red! It was horrible! <endOfText>
<human> I bet it was.It looks like you had a panic attack. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my friend comes over he never keeps an eye on his kids and they ravage my home! <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible! Have you ever said anything to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to pack my suit so I had to borrow my friend's extra one when attending a wedding, and man it fits so bad! I look terrible! <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Well on the bright side at least you had a suit. Hopefully you were just a regular attendee.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks. Well on the bright side at least you had a suit. Hopefully you were just a regular attendee. <endOfText>
<human> I was, but I still felt so self conscious it was hard to enjoy the night. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The store was all sold out of the new book I wanted. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! You should have preordered it online! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know! I normally do, but I thought it would be okay. Next time I will though. <endOfText>
<human> What book was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone backed into my truck in the parking lot. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! You must be quite upset about that. I am sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, did you ever walk in the woods only to see a snake? <endOfText>
<human> I have not seen a snake in the woods, have you? That sounds frightening! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad the other day- I tried on a dress at the store and it looked awful, but I saw another girl trying it on as well and she looked great. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hate when that happens. I'm sorry you felt that way. Did you not buy the dress? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't, but I did find some shirts I like luckily. <endOfText>
<human> That's good though. I'm glad you were able to find something. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to zip my pant after using the washroom and I walked into a meeting with top executives from my head office <endOfText>
<human> oh man.Tha must have been so embarassing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes and the funny part was I didn't realize until the meeting was ended. <endOfText>
<human> You could not read the room?? Someone was probably laughing at you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling an intense fear these days. <endOfText>
<human> first way to overcome it is to figure out the reason for the fear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently went to a safari where I was riding in a vehicle and one of the elephants got a bit rowdy and pushed up against the truck. I was freaking out! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That must have been frightening! That sounds like an exciting experience, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My social anxiety kicked up the other day while paying for groceries and I failed at doing basic math in my hand due to my nerves. I ended up giving the wrong amount of money. <endOfText>
<human> It's okay. People are very understanding. Did you underpay? I'm sure it happens all the time!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's okay. People are very understanding. Did you underpay? I'm sure it happens all the time! <endOfText>
<human> Yup, I did! And I'm usually very good at math. When my anxiety acts up, it's like my brain just goes blank. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, did you ever win a drawing that you won a cash prize for? <endOfText>
<human> I did. I once won $10,000 from Colgate Toothpaste. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was very supportive when I was in distress <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear you were feeling that way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my diet today. <endOfText>
<human> That's not so bad. Everyone cheats on their diet from time to time. I would just pick up where you left off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> True, but I haven't cheated on my diet in over a year. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's all the more reason that you shouldn't worry about it! You deserved to have a day off after that long! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a thank you note from the VP of applications at my company. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how exciting, you must be proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My preschool aged son got invited to a birthday party last week and I wanted to take him, but I was a bit nervous because he's been acting out lately and I didn't want him throwing a tantrum in public. <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up taking him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no haha he is just like a typical three year old, they all go through these "threenager" ages where they like to challenge you a lot. <endOfText>
<human> I'm aware of the "terrible two's"  I've never heard of the threenager but, im not surprised to hear of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my 3DS next to me on my desk and thought about all of the Pokemon games I played as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I love Pokemon! The first one I ever played was Pokemon Blue. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy these days because I am about to get a promotion at work <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome to hear! Your hard work has paid off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my personal training exam coming up soon and I think I'll ace it! <endOfText>
<human> Good luck.I bet you are ready for this exam. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband was out of town for work recently, and it made me bummed out. I had no one to talk to or spend time with. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Maybe you can find yourself a new hobby that will keep you occupied while he's gone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I mostly just have been baking and reading, relaxing and just having some me time, but I just miss him haha. <endOfText>
<human> That's understandable. I'd probably feel the same way in the same situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad didn't invite me to his wedding, talk about an all time low. <endOfText>
<human> So you guys probably don't get along very well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, do you have any mailings awaiting you? <endOfText>
<human> I don't, are you waiting for one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an invite to go camping this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds like fun if you are an outdoor person. Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I got a raise! I'm glad my work was noticed <endOfText>
<human> Congrats.I bet you worked hard for tha raised. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wife so much.She is the center of my life. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's nice! I haven't considered that yet as I'm still quite young <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first pregnancy did not go as planned at all - in fact, it will probably go down as the most scary time in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What happened? I can't imagine having to go through something that scary.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! What happened? I can't imagine having to go through something that scary. <endOfText>
<human> Things were fine until 36 weeks.  Then all you know what happened.  I developed HELLP syndrome, my organs started shutting down, blood pressure was super high.  Had an emergency c-section and in the hospital for over a week after - came close to losing both of us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home and I quickly realized that my neighbors chopped down a tree in my front yard while I was away on vacation. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man... that would tick me off.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a 2 week vacation coming up. I'm very excited for it! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds exciting! Are you going anywhere exotic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally got a day off of work today. I sat down and played my favorite video game with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's fun! I love to play video games, but it's usually with friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not happy at how I am treated because of my orientation to life <endOfText>
<human> What's your orientation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you know how mortified I am? I was knocked over by a huge wave in the ocean and my top was ripped off! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, hope u are alright now. It must have been a terrible experience <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so prepared for my test tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> What is the subject?? The test will be oral or in writing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at the republicans. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think they are messing up the country? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so much in love with my wife. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome.  How long have you been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I accidentally threw out my co-worker's lunch today at work. <endOfText>
<human> That happens sometimes.  Was it mistaken for something that might have been sitting there forever? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not a fan of birthdays, so I usually try to keep my birthday secret from people when I meet them. <endOfText>
<human> I'm kinda the same way. Although, I feel like if my friends truly care about me, they'll find out and remember my birthday on their own. No need to go blabbing to everyone about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a very proud moment today...I think it has finally dawned upon my dog that she has to go to the bathroom outside! <endOfText>
<human> Yay! That is a difficult feat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the worst headache and can't get any of my cleaning done. It's frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried taking any aspirin? I feel bad for you, my friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was wearing a new dress for the holidays and it just made me feel good about myself, it looked nice and it put me in a good mood. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. There's nothing like a bit of retail therapy to cheer you up. Now you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About two weeks ago my wife got sick with Tonsilitis. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. Is she feeling any better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to give a major speech tomorrow at work early in the morning. <endOfText>
<human> I know the anciptation of giving big presentations.  Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got off work the other day and noticed one of my tires had been slashed in the parking lot.  Needless to say, not the best way to end the work day <endOfText>
<human> Holy moly, that's some rough luck. Did you find the guy who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy these days. <endOfText>
<human> I am so glad to hear that. What is the secret? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a huge test tomorrow in Physics and I don't feel prepared for it. <endOfText>
<human> Get to studying! I'm sure if you get in a few mores hours you will feel more confident!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Get to studying! I'm sure if you get in a few mores hours you will feel more confident! <endOfText>
<human> You're right! But no matter how much studying I may do, I know it's going to be a tough one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, yesterday morning, some ingrate stole my cappuccino at Starbucks. <endOfText>
<human> How did that happen? I would be so upset. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Way back in my elementary school days, I lost the spelling when I was only in the second grade. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well it's still fun that you got to participate in that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole a soda as a teenager and got caught in the parking lot by the security people. I felt so ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, did anything end up happening to you? Did you get 20 years in prison? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha no she called my parents and I was banned from the store. <endOfText>
<human> Eh, I suppose worse things could happen. Was it worth it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so accomplished when I started my own business. It's still in the beginning phase but it's an awesome feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Great! what kind of business? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son won the spelling bee yesterday. I felt so proud of him! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Do you remember what words he had to spell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was looking through my wallet and realized a bunch of money was missing. There was only one person who was near my wallet. <endOfText>
<human> That's a downer, man. Who do you think was the perpetrator? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son failed his final exam yesterday. I was so upset with him! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did he not study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently traveled by plane and I loved seeing the city I love at night, the view was beautiful. <endOfText>
<human> I love flying!  Was it your first time on an airplane? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while back, my ex-wife and I were having marriage problems.  To make things worse, my work sent another woman and I away for training for a few months. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes destiny has strange ways of manifesting itself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my college days so much <endOfText>
<human> I do as well! What do you miss most? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my son repeatedly to do the dishes, but instead he played video games all night and never got them done. <endOfText>
<human> You should confiscate his video game and teach him a lesson. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am being in fear lately <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Any particular reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was meeting my friend for drinks and she said she left her debit card at home. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. How did you pay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take the trash out last night and the bag busted open on the way to the road <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that must've been awful!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, that must've been awful! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, you don't even know. I was covered in filth that "Cradle of Filth" doesn't even know about. I was so disgusted that I thought I was going to die. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a huge conflict with my parents about moving to another country and I was simply enraged to have them trying to control my life. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer. What happened once you moved there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was an awesome experience and after I came back to the US I felt so fulfilled and my perspective on everything has changed. <endOfText>
<human> It's good to hear that your experience was fulfilling. I hope I can have a similar once someday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stop spending money, no matter what I do, no matter how many budgets I put together. How can I be so careless? <endOfText>
<human> That would be tough! Have you tried switching to cash envelopes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got called into the CEOs office a number of years ago <endOfText>
<human> and what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> and what happened? <endOfText>
<human> I was shocked because  they offered a promotion. It sounded like something was wrong <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Most of my co-workers are incompetent and can't recognize basic patterns <endOfText>
<human> it sucks when you can't depend on co-workers <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate all of the pizza that I got my friends last night. I felt pretty rotten afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I have done that before as well. You may have to deal with some indigestion. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have a way to pay for my lunch despite today being pay day! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, you must have been quite upset. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was driving home from work the other day I saw a lot of very dark clouds in the sky. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe it was a thunderstorm forming?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at my boss these days. <endOfText>
<human> Really? What did your boss do that made you so mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son won his last baseball game and he is going to the state championship! <endOfText>
<human> That is great news!  What does he play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out my closet and noticed some old photos I took of my very first car.  Man, it makes me miss the days when life was simple <endOfText>
<human> Those were the days, my friend. What kind of car did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate ten Big Macs last night because I was so hungry and depressed. I resented myself afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> OMG, i don't think i could eat that many burgers in a week if I tried. What was bothering you so much that it lead to you eating so many burgers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I saw a man take a dog from the street, I've been seeing that dog for a while and in a couple of days I see this dog on the streets again, poor little thing. I thought it'd have a better life. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad, I wonder why the dog can't find a home! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know but it's a sweetheart, I'd take it myself if only I didn't have one already. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe the poor dog doesn't get along with other dogs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfather passed a year ago today thanks to medical malpractice. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. That must be so hard. How have you been coping? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won first place at the egg swallowing contest at my school the other day! <endOfText>
<human> What haha that's a real thing??? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shopping at the store the other day and I bumped into a rack and spilled wine bottles everywhere. Everyone was staring. <endOfText>
<human> Oh geez, that sounds pretty embarrassing. Did any of the bottles break? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was almost hit by a car while I was walking in a crosswalk and I cursed the lady out. Then I saw a little kid in the car and instantly regretted what I just said. <endOfText>
<human> You should feel bad for just cursing at a lady. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now. <endOfText>
<human> That must be a great feeling!  Good for you!  You should be proud that things are going well and not take it for granted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am expecting a big recession on the horizon <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I am as well. Do you have any investments that could be affected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hiking in the Outback of Australia the other day. I managed to swallow a dozen ostrich eggs on my adventure. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, do they taste good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to cut that short, but I have to send an email to a company I really want to work for today and I don't want to mess it up. <endOfText>
<human> Sure, go ahead. Is it an important one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it would be for my first internship and it could really make my life much easier if I get it. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Have yo sent it yet? Congratulations, by the way. Wish you good luck ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I haven't but I need to. I will once we finish this conversation. <endOfText>
<human> OK sure. Go ahead <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband's grandma came to visit, we did all sorts of fun activities at the beach and aquarium. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! that sounds like fun. What was your favorite part of the visit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know what's great? Finding pictures of my kids as babies and going through those and remembering all the great times. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, did you find a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is uncomfortable for the internet service to fail when I am doing something important on the PC. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it sure is. Especially when you are streaming or talking to someone in the moment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Completely frustrating. I usually end up calling customer service and complaining until it's fixed if it happens repeatedly. <endOfText>
<human> Thank God in most cases they solve it quickly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week my daughter had a big soccer game against a team that was better than hers. <endOfText>
<human> did your daughter's team win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband's sister was living with us. She was acting rude so we had to kick her out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is terrible. Are you guys still talking now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I had to give a speech. I was very nervous so I practiced over and over. When the time came, I was ready and it went awesome <endOfText>
<human> I would be scared too, but I'm happy it turned out well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After spending so much on my brother's tuition fees overseas, he still ended up becoming a musician without popularity <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is too bad. I am sorry for your unneeded expenditures. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just take it that I did something for God, I hope he rewards me <endOfText>
<human> That is a good attitude to have. I am proud of your maturity. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are doing everything but listening today! I guess the boredom that comes with summer break is getting to them. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, kids get crazy when they are bored.  Get them to read a book! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad knew that I have recently hit a rough patch with my finances and gave me 2 grand. I can't thank him enough. <endOfText>
<human> How kind of him! I bet that is going to help you out a lot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night and saw a scorpion. I covered it with a bowl but when I woke up it was gone from the bowl. <endOfText>
<human> Omg, you should have killed it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger, I had social anxiety. Speeches would give me terrible anxiety <endOfText>
<human> Have you been able to get over your fear? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on the phone with my aunt. I am so awkward and bad at speaking so I was nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Was your aunt nice to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a traffic jam because people were slowing to look at a wreck on the other side of the highway <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hate when that happens.  People always feel a need to look and it causes the other lanes to be at a standstill as well.  How long did you have to wait? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter had a little chihuahua pup that we rescued and she had an autoimmune disease.  We had a rough first year, but then it seemed things were good. <endOfText>
<human> So, the pup is healthy and  situated now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to fly up and go see my girlfriend in Boston soon! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! Has it been a long time since you've seen her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About two months! However while it is sappy, more than a day without seeing her feels like eternity. <endOfText>
<human> I'm jealous! That's so sweet and I hope you have a great time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my ankle right before my wedding! This is a nightmare! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I survived cancer and I'm thankful <endOfText>
<human> That would be difficult, so glad you survived. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my boss asked me a question that I had an answer to but I did n ot want to get anyone in trouble so I said I didn't know anything about the situation. <endOfText>
<human> maybe it was best to avoid drama at work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on my boyfriend <endOfText>
<human> Has your boyfriend ever cheated on you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to train a new employee at work today. <endOfText>
<human> How did that go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy that I have finally gotten a head start on being organized to teach this year <endOfText>
<human> This is so good, well done <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The quality of television the make these days compared to when I was growing up is very good <endOfText>
<human> I think there are a lot more choices now than there was years ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I were about to go away for our first vacation together. I was so excited. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter's daycare teacher just called me and told me how she's been so sweet to the new boy in her class who was very nervous on his first day. I couldn't feel more joy. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome.  Good parenting pays off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not have enough money for rent, but I had some freelance work that I could do and I was confident I could make the money in time. <endOfText>
<human> You are a hard working person, you will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you, that's encouraging. <endOfText>
<human> Like they say, hard-work never killed anyone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stop taking people serious after i realize that my wife of 5 years had a baby without telling me <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god that's crazy, I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's alright, I think it's good to do proper background check and make sure one is 100% sure before jumping into dealings with people these days <endOfText>
<human> I hope nothing like that ever happens again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not know if I will get a positive or negative review. I do not ever look forward to these things! <endOfText>
<human> What type of review are you looking for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is my annual review for work. My performance review. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that would be nerve wracking! Good Luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I felt so abandoned when my family went to town all day without me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, I've felt similar before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day after hockey I found out my cat died, pretty miserable. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sorry to hear that. I lost my cat recently too. <endOfText>
<human> His name was Sylvestre, what was your cats name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've a bit nervous. I've got a blind date tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow really? You shouldn't be! You should be excited <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it's the anniversary of my grandmother's death today <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. I've lost both of mine, I know how you feel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For my 16th birthday I received a brand new car! It was a red convertible. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I never got a car for mine! Did you take good care of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's going to be a very challenging school year for my daughters. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hi there? <endOfText>
<human> Hi friend, how are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling happy in my work and being able to enjoy it makes my life better. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. what makes you so happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was bummed out this mothers day because my mom disowned me and won't speak to me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I am so sorry to hear that. May I ask what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get ready for a job interview last week and I did a lot of homework! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure it was hard but worth it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when I was a teenager my mother always tried to get me to be ready for being sexually active, and I knew what to do and where to go to get birth control. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was an awkward conversation. Did you feel embarassed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been posted to the middle east for work, i'm a little bit edgy about what the place will be like <endOfText>
<human> I've heard it's quite dangerous, are you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe I finally finished high school, didn't think I'd make it. <endOfText>
<human> Yea somethings are just worth trying to see how they'd go. You made it through welldone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into the living room there was a big party waiting for me for my birthday. I was beyond elated. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's so fun, you're lucky to have many people who care about you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband's grandma came to stay with us when we had our third baby and she took great care of us, made us a lot of food and bought us some new kitchen tools. <endOfText>
<human> That is so thoughtful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bad experience where my jacket was stolen. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of jacket did they steal from you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing in the kitchen and accidentally broke my moms vase. <endOfText>
<human> you shouldn't' have been playing in the kitchen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have had so many health issues this year. It is been crucial to find the silver linings <endOfText>
<human> Finding things to be grateful for have saved my sanity <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a very optimistic person. Everyday I wake up expecting the best! <endOfText>
<human> What is your favorite part about each day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has been paying more attention on our son since childbirth. It's not fair, I feel left out <endOfText>
<human> that is her maternal instinct <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was caught taking something that was not mine I feel so bad about this <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is terrible. What did you take? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my little boy to the zoo last month. It was fun, but he soaked his diaper three times! <endOfText>
<human> Wow the zoo sounds like an amazing time. Lol the diaper thing happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a full ride scholarship to my dream school. I was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds amazing. I would have died and gone to heaven if I had gotten one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have read alot so I know I won't fail the exam I am going for <endOfText>
<human> what subject is it in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had forgotten to start dinner, even though my husband has asked me to while he was at work, and so when he got home we had no food, and I felt bad. <endOfText>
<human> Well, he could bring something home. Don't feel bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I helped a friend of mie who is going through a rough time. Her husband has left her and he drained the bank account. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, how horrible! I hope she will be okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store, and I saw someone cut in front of someone else in line which made me really upset. <endOfText>
<human> Dang. That is annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some old toys from when I was a kid <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was really cool! Did you play with them for a little? You're never to old to play with toys <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did get one working again actually. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome! Old toys are the best toys <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to fly up and see my girlfriend in a few weeks! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How long have you been apart for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just about two months. However as sappy as it sounds, more than a day without seeing her feels like forever. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have some fun activities planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went skydiving a couple months ago and seriously had to trust that the guy going with me knew what he was doing. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow! I've always wanted to do that. You're quite brave <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a big presentation that I was very nervous about, but I practiced ahead of time and nailed it! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! Why were you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One morning my cat was screaming and I found out she pooped on the bed <endOfText>
<human> Wow.  That is a sight to wake up to.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So this weekend I went to the hall bathroom and I snake was there!  I nearly passed out <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! Did it try to bite you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No.  It was a little garden snake.  But not something I was expecting to see at midnight on my bathroom floor. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been a shock. I hope you took it outside after that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt I was ready for the task after all the research I had done on the individuals I would be meeting with. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of task was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an extra day off this week that I wasn't expecting! <endOfText>
<human> I bet you're so happy! I would be!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you're so happy! I would be! <endOfText>
<human> I really am. I love days off, but I suppose everyone does too lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex husband passed away last year. <endOfText>
<human> Omg I am so sorry to hear that. :( Are you feeling at peace at all now?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Omg I am so sorry to hear that. :( Are you feeling at peace at all now? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but I really did take it hard. We knew each other for 30 years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss talked down to me the other day, it made me so upset! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible and frustrating because you can't really do anything about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So true so true you cant... unless you quit lol <endOfText>
<human> HAHA, best to find another job first. At least employment is looking pretty good these days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, just a few weeks back we had our summer vacation, which consisted of 14 hours of driving with 4 boys aged 9-15. Needless to say, I'm glad that drive is over. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that sounds awful. I thought the 7 hour drives we did with 3 of us were awful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, add another one in and double the time and you'll have our trip. The youngest has ADHD too, so that always keeps it interesting. <endOfText>
<human> That's rough. I feel for you! But, as you said it's over so life goes on :} <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend likes to learn new things sometimes, and he recently learne to juggle several items at once! <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty amazing. I have tried juggling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's pretty amazing. I have tried juggling 3 small objects before and felt like it was impossible. <endOfText>
<human> Same here. I have no idea how he does it...but it's quite amazing to see. I'm somewhat envious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner is away getting treatment and therapy and it's hard. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  What do they get treatment for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was no traffic on the way to work today! <endOfText>
<human> That's nice, must have saved you a lot of time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It did <endOfText>
<human> It's election day here, that may be the cause of it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, my daughters have a day off from school due to our state elections. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I got that many days off.  The good old days of childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am staying very positive that this year even if it is coming close to an end I will find a better job! <endOfText>
<human> Great attitude! Yes whatever you put your mind too and work hard at, will happen! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it will and thank you for the encouragement! :) <endOfText>
<human> You're so welcome! Good luck and I hope it's a great place with a good paycheck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very happy when we got to see a concert involving my brother. I was nice seeing him up there <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to see family! What concert was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I recently rescued another abused dog and I feel so protective towards her. She is so docile and she was so starved. I just want to keep her safe. <endOfText>
<human> I am so happy for you and the dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This past year, i failed my Calculus class twice. I am lost and don't know how to pass this class <endOfText>
<human> Have you asked the teacher for any sort of help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My credit card is ridiculous. I'm so embarrassed and upset with myself that I let it get this bad. <endOfText>
<human> Are spending too much on unnecessary things? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my dad got to retire. He worked hard for it <endOfText>
<human> Congrats to your father! At what age did he get to finally relax!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really think I am going to get the preapproval from the bank for my new home purchase... <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Are you excited <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Like you would not believe! I am so happy for it, and feeling positive. <endOfText>
<human> It should be a easy process <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting off at a new school next month. <endOfText>
<human> Oh great! Is it a college and what are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went off of my keto for a two days and I feel a bit bad about it- I ate a bag of cheetos over two days. They were organic anyhow <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know how that feels. You can start over tomorrow though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole my lawn mower <endOfText>
<human> OH no. I really dislike theives. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is leaving me. <endOfText>
<human> Leaving you? why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I had to go to the store yesterday but I was all muddy. It made me quite anxious. I didn't have a choice as my power went out and I didn't have much clean. <endOfText>
<human> we are too hard on ourselves! we really shouldnt care what others think but i would have felt the same  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we are too hard on ourselves! we really shouldnt care what others think but i would have felt the same <endOfText>
<human> I usually do not but boy I hate it when my clothes are not clean and I'm not clean. I try not to let it get to me..but I just feel gross! lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im the same! give people a look when they look at you maybe some crazy eyes! lol <endOfText>
<human> Crazy eyes won't work here as I am in the ghetto- most everyone is really crazy lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled water all over myself at school and it looked like a peed on myself! ugh <endOfText>
<human> Oh geez! That would suck! I hope it wasn't a cold day? Could you drive home and get new clothes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> luckily no because im in florida but ugh i felt so dumb! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I have numbness in my hands so I am always spilling things so don't feel too bad! I understand though. As you can see- I don't like having stuff on my clothes either lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My toddler is learning how to talk and what objects are called. The other day he was at my parents house and came out of his room with a stuffed giraffe and told everyone, "look, giraffe!" <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well my partner fell off the wagon lately and went back to people that are really bad for him. He has bipolar etc so his influences are really crutial. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awful. Mine used to have a bad group of friends too at one point so I know how it feels. Sometimes you just want to yell "grow up!!!" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It killed me pretty much when I lost my dad. It was so random and I was not ready for it <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. It sounds like a freak accident. What happend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drank yesterday on my lunch break and was nervous to come back into the office afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you nervous <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year I decided to donate school supplies to my daughters school. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine she and the school appreciate that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little unsure when I changed schools. I was not sure how it would go. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever really watched one of those st jude infomercials? <endOfText>
<human> I have seen them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked in a good way when my dad got me a truck. It was for my senior year in high school <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That's pretty cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet snake died :( <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, how old was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I missed my cousins wedding. I even made up a bad excuse <endOfText>
<human> What was your excuse? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner is away at therapy and he sent me a card. I was really shocked as he normally needs a prompt to do anything that involves a gift. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like he's getting the hang of it, that's good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have a partner? <endOfText>
<human> yes I do. Do you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I am having a fly issue. I have sticky fly paper (although I hate killing anything) and I clean and no matter what I keep getting flies that bat themselves at me all day. <endOfText>
<human> Sticky paper is so gross. have you every used cloves? You can put the in your windows to keep flies out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always bought my kids clothes from the same store, Childrens Place. <endOfText>
<human> Okay, How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to ace my science test. I spent a lot of time studying for it <endOfText>
<human> Thats pretty awesome! College or highschool testt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well my power went out yesterday before my shower and before I had washed my clothes. So I had to run up to the fast food place- walk- and try to contact my mom. It made me a bit embarassed going outside in dirty clothes with wet hair. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure no one noticed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to get this job. I just wanted it more than other people <endOfText>
<human> So you did get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared when I started my most current job that I had to trick myself into being less shy. <endOfText>
<human> New people make me so nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to meet my kids teacher yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? I bet that was exciting for both of you. Open house at their school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm kind of socially awkward and I don't know how to start conversations in real life. I wish i had more friends <endOfText>
<human> having a few good friends or even one is better then having a bunch of fake ones. It is hard to make friends as an adult that are true friends even if you are great at it! So don't feel bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I found out the raise goes into effect immediately and I got a new desk and office also <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That must be nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter this money grows on trees and life is so easy. <endOfText>
<human> Most of them are like that, or they are fixated by what everything costs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to look back at times of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. I hope you have nice memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got arrested when I was younger. I felt embarrassed to tell my parents <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I saw a guy at the gas station yesterday and he was over 40..listening to nasty rap and of course he got out to use the free air pump then just THREW it on the ground. They constantly have to replace it and it's the only free one in the area. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sound alful! Some people have zero respect for others belonging and even less for things we all need to share. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I woke up to the sound of rain outside my window. It was so much better than my terrible alarm clock waking me up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! I LOVE the sound of rain, I could just sit in the warm rain too!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh! I LOVE the sound of rain, I could just sit in the warm rain too! <endOfText>
<human> Indeed! It makes me so happy. Some people hate the rain, I am not one of those. Glad you like it too. Makes the world feel cleaner too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my dad was going to heal. He was in the hospital but I had a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> Oh thank goodness! If I may ask, what was he in the hospital for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well when I was at the gas station yesterday I kept hearing a child scream- I saw a lady park right in front and take a little boy in- I thought it was him- But she had left her little GIRL in the car ALONE! <endOfText>
<human> I hate when people do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once haf my name called over the intercom at Walmart. <endOfText>
<human> What did they want? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always tried to be good to my family. <endOfText>
<human> Did something bad happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started the show Luther on Netflix. <endOfText>
<human> I've heard of that, is it any good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday someone pulled up beside us in the gas station, blasting rap music. I was shocked when a middle aged white guy stepped out. It was super obnoxious, vile music too. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is crazy, sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area, sadly!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that is crazy, sometimes not so uncommon depending on your area, sadly! <endOfText>
<human> It's very common here. You have gramma's doing bad things, walking down the street drunk or drugged etc. But it still shocks me when someone who is a father and grandpa is acting like a bad teen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was very random when it happen, but my grand ma passed away and it was sad. I did not expect it <endOfText>
<human> Death can happen in an INSTANT! I have been there the past year. I am sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sticking by my partner even though he has done a lot because no one else has. While he is in therapy. It's hard. I don't know if he will get better but I guess it's worth a shot since no one else has ever helped him or been a good influence. <endOfText>
<human> Its always worth a shot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shamed when my dad got in trouble. It was just a little sad to be his son at the time <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a big storm last night. <endOfText>
<human> I do hate storms, they can be scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are 3 and 5 and school starts soon and I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting! So it will be the first real year of school for you and them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is exciting! So it will be the first real year of school for you and them? <endOfText>
<human> No, my 5 year old was in prek last year and my 3 year old went to mother's day out last year two days a wekk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot all about prek, you can see mine arent old enough yet. lol Well I am happy for you thats very exciting. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is! They get so bored during the summer. There's only so much I can do to entertain them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out my house the other day and came across my parents old wedding rings. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is exciting. What did you do with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put them together on a necklace so I can wear them. :) <endOfText>
<human> That's a great idea. Such a good way to preserve a memory. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Both of my daughters are fine musicians. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats amazing! How old are they and what do they play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son pooped his pants but lucky i carry baby wipes to wipe it up quick before it leaks <endOfText>
<human> Oh geez. That is common with kids. Not the funnest times. Do you carry extra clothes too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom has helped my gramma for years. With her husband before he died..and now she helps her. My gramma is very giving but can be kind of mean to my mom at times. I am very proud of her for still being so kind <endOfText>
<human> How old is your gramma ? old people can get grumpy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car broke down <endOfText>
<human> What happened to it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when my cousin did not come to my moms funeral. He lied to me about it <endOfText>
<human> What was his excuse? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was young I loved the PBS channel. <endOfText>
<human> That's very vague, did you like the shows? Or the program itself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the dealership where I bought my car a week ago and I was getting an oil change. The service was so good, and they took care of my car really quick! <endOfText>
<human> Doesn't that cost a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter starts daycare soon, first time, first born but I think I have everything ready! <endOfText>
<human> Oh! Do you feel scared at all and will miss her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes a little bit because its hard to trust anyone and I am so protective over her. I will miss her a lot! <endOfText>
<human> Do they have cameras there so you can watch her during the day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> (Sorry yes daycares do have a way to log in- ask them so you can ensure she is safe) I am losing weight again and it's been hard with my stress, age and after surgery. I love feeling the new areas I am thin! <endOfText>
<human> I will look into that thank you so much thats kind of you! Any special diet or fitness online you are following? I know you can do this.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do keto! I can't do so much cheese or meat if its not organic. But I found out about natural sugar substitues like Xylitol (wow!!) as I have a sweet tooth- But fasting and only eating two meals has done WONDERS for me! <endOfText>
<human> I recently read about fasting myself! I tried it for a whole few days and of course stopped. I wish I had your determination! I wish you a lot of luck. :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will look into that thank you so much thats kind of you! Any special diet or fitness online you are following? I know you can do this. <endOfText>
<human> I do keto! I can't do so much cheese or meat if its not organic. But I found out about natural sugar substitues like Xylitol (wow!!) as I have a sweet tooth- But fasting and only eating two meals has done WONDERS for me!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently read about fasting myself! I tried it for a whole few days and of course stopped. I wish I had your determination! I wish you a lot of luck. :) <endOfText>
<human> Oh you should try keto with it- as it keeps you FULL and you don't get hungry so it's possible! Try doing 16 hours- Not eating breakfast until 4 hours or so after getting up. It regenerates your organs, skin everything and SO much energy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbor has an ugly cat that keeps pissing in my bbq grill <endOfText>
<human> Aw poor kitty! Well that is their fault for sure. Have you spoke to them about it? Also you can get these spray things that keep cast out of your yard- They spray them with water when they cross a barrier- <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Strangely I have a cat tail too! I rescue and my cat room needs to be painted badly but I have been so busy working and also on a side business that I have had no extra time! <endOfText>
<human> You should make it a weekend project <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighborhood put together a community wide cleanup day, it was great fun and such a sight to see! <endOfText>
<human> That is so beautiful! Are you going to do it every year now and make it tradition?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so beautiful! Are you going to do it every year now and make it tradition? <endOfText>
<human> I think so, it was such a great turnout, it'd be silly not to! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just bought a car for cheap as ours was in an accident and the guy seemed so normal but lied and the engine has a ton of issues. <endOfText>
<human> so you got a lemon ? check your state laws <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> there was a time i had no food to eat now i'm so glad i can afford food and my pantry is stocked to the brim <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I so understand that! Did you have to eat ramen and $1 meals? I did! It was awful! I am so glad you are in a better place now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighborgood wasn't so safe last year. <endOfText>
<human> What did he do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh neighborhood, lol I thought it said neighbor for a second! Why wasnt it safe? <endOfText>
<human> Now I see the mistake I made too lol. There just were abunch of bad people around. This summer was nice for the kids though. They are all gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Typos happen to the best of us right! Im glad the summer was atleast nice for them and that the bad people left! <endOfText>
<human> I love to see the kids have fun! We all deserve a fevent childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im feeling a little bad about what I did maybe I shouldnt maybe I should idk. <endOfText>
<human> I'll be the judge of that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I both needed new phones, but I could only afford 1 and I ended up buying 1 for myself. I am going to buy her one in a few months but I still feel real bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's nothing. As long as you still get her a phone. I wouldnt be mad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah but I can feel the tension! <endOfText>
<human> Well give her the new phone and then you get one later. Happy wife happy life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so happy i could afford a 65 inch tv, i had a small 19 incher for years. it was not pleasant but i was poor and struggling <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hear you! It' <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my power go out yesterday and it reminded me of how grateful I am to have that convenience! <endOfText>
<human> how long was it out for <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was working and a lady was concerned about her daughter. I went above and beyond my work description in order to let her know about cameras at a daycare and how she could see them. <endOfText>
<human> That's very kind of you.  Did she feel better after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt died last week <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I am so sorry! You must be devastated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother lives across the country and told me he wouldn't make it out for my graduation but he did anyway! <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was a nice surprise <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got detention when I did not wrong. I was so furious at the kid who actually did the deed <endOfText>
<human> What does the teacher say happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Does it make you happy to see others you havent seen in a while <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes depending on who they are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently seen my Mum after not seeing her for 6 months . I was so happy to see her . <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice. Im happy for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a storm kit  because we werent prepared last time <endOfText>
<human> a hurricane ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just a bad lightening storm that left us without power for days. <endOfText>
<human> we have a hurricane kit / emergency essential kit always .  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we have a hurricane kit / emergency essential kit always . <endOfText>
<human> Well I have one now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> apple is an evil company, they just become a trillion dollar company today. i feel they betray their customer base by releasing the same phone every year <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same! I hate apple products. I refuse to use them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I din't do well in Biology last semester. I am ready for this one though <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will do great. What kind of biology is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a memory pop up on my facebook the other day it was a photo of my hands, and my moms hand. I was taking care of her during her last days. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! That is so sad! I am so sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah its okay it happens thats life! I enjoyed being able to know I was the one making sure she was okay as she went! <endOfText>
<human> That is a good way of looking at things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lady left her young kid in the car yesterday alone in front of the gas station. I would have video taped it but my mom told me after she left. Anything could've happened..and too boot- we are in the ghetto. <endOfText>
<human> Some people are just so careless... I am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child. shame on the parent tho.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some people are just so careless... I am sure your mom was keeping a good eye on the child. shame on the parent tho. <endOfText>
<human> My mom saw it when she came out- It was hot out too- child in a car seat..YOUNG- Screaming. Seriously? I just don't get it- Even in a nice town your child can get stolen in a second. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know its a pain in the rear to lug them around but you have to. I lug mine around like a kangaroo with her kid in her pouch. <endOfText>
<human> Lol! Good workout though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when I did not get a bonus at work. I just thought that I would get it <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst.. expectations can make and break us. I hope the next time around you get it!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's the worst.. expectations can make and break us. I hope the next time around you get it! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I am hopeful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My house has been on the market for 3 months, and our market is so BAD! I figured oh it'll take a year or no one will buy it - but I got an offer on it a few days ago! <endOfText>
<human> That is a great. I hope it was a good offer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was decent, better than none I suppose! It was actually an offer from my neighbor! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds convenient <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In these uncertain times, it's easy to be happy that I have a roof over my head. <endOfText>
<human> That is so true.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so true. <endOfText>
<human> I think we can find little things to be thankful for wherever we look. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makees me sad that some people can't afford school clothes for their children. <endOfText>
<human> That makes me sad too. I wish there was more I could do to help out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I donated supplies this year. Maybe next year I will be able to donate uniforms. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good idea! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School starts back next Thursday. I have two kids going in and this is the first year that I have felt completely ready. <endOfText>
<human> It feels good when your on top of things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week was my parents anniversary. e had a family dinner for them with my siblings and I. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats wonderful! how long have your parents been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an old guy riding his scooter the other day..but on the ROAD to the grocery store. I felt so bad for him and wondered why he didn't have any family to help. <endOfText>
<human> I've seen that before. It is sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends all went back to college and now I have no one to hang out with. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's a bummer! Do you go to college locally? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not to gross you out but I heard some stuff about periods the other day on a favorite youtube channel and boy did it remind me of the struggles as a teen! Good and bad times <endOfText>
<human> I don't think anything is worse than dealing with a period as a teenager! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew I was going to pass my history test. I had listened and studied all year <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! History is HARD! I always had a hard time remembering the dates and times especially. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have older animals and I will do whatever is needed to ensure they are healthy. I work so they can have a good life <endOfText>
<human> Its nice that you care so much about them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get rid of my animals when I meant my wife due to her allergies. It was really difficult. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. How many animals did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had 2... I had them for years. It really sucked but we tried for almost 2 years, and her allergies were insanely bad to the point of hospital visits. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of animals were they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my girlfriend broke up <endOfText>
<human> ugh.. for the better or worst? How are you feeling?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ugh.. for the better or worst? How are you feeling? <endOfText>
<human> A pretty big mix.  It's probably best its over. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If you are feeling that way then it probably is! On to a fresh start. <endOfText>
<human> Indeed, time to get back into the dating scene. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to see how my daughters turn out as adults. <endOfText>
<human> Me either. It is going to be interesting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep everything my kids make. <endOfText>
<human> Hope you've got a lot of storage room. We try to do that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  was super stoked when my mom brought me dinner the other day and she knew just what I wanted, without asking. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, mothers have the best instincts when it comes to their children. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am normally very relaxed, happy and laid back.  Everything in life just seems right! <endOfText>
<human> You're very lucky! A lot of people can't say that these days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man in our community was hit by a drunk driver the other night while walking his dog, he didn't survive. It's very heartbreaking. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad!  I would be so mad at the drunk driver!  How could he live with himself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Security at the grocery store followed me to my car the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Why did they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure that was embarrassing. Just a mistake. <endOfText>
<human> It was. That has never happened to me before. People were staring. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son's football team did not perform well at all during the season, but they still got to do a tournament at the end. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool. Did they win any games in the tournament? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked the US hockey team won hold in 1980. <endOfText>
<human> Who did they win it over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> felt really nervous when I took my driving test <endOfText>
<human> Did you pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty let down when I didn't get a good raise <endOfText>
<human> That is disappointing. What will you do now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is very good at spelling. <endOfText>
<human> THat is great.  SHe will have fun participating in spelling bees <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a scare a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> what scared you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt a great emotion of care when my first child was born <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. I feel the same about my daughters. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sister used to be my next door neighbor. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend cheated on me with my best friend! Why would he do that?? <endOfText>
<human> He is a jerk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have wanted every career out there. You name it <endOfText>
<human> Why have you wanted every career instead of focusing on just one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co workers keeps getting rated as number 1 at work, but I know hes doing the work dirty to get such a rating. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  Have you investigated her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I turned him in and they didnt do anything because they dont care. It helps them generate money as well. <endOfText>
<human> Sucks, I've had to work under scumbag managment before <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hit my goal weight of 180lbs <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome! What have you been doing to reach it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats awesome! What have you been doing to reach it? <endOfText>
<human> Say no to booze, stop eating garbage, meal prep. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ugh sounds like work...... but you did it! <endOfText>
<human> It wasn't bad at all. and making all your own food saves money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt nervous before I rode on an airplane for the first time <endOfText>
<human> I'm 50 and haven't rode one since I was 2. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to next year when my finances get better. <endOfText>
<human> I can relate to that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can relate to that. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it's a big improvement for us both. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was floored when I found out I won an award at work <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  What was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very self conscious about being an ex con <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally called my girlfriend my ex-girlfriend's name. <endOfText>
<human> whoops, lots of people have done that. what'd she say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty confident that I was going to place in the top ten of the marathon <endOfText>
<human> And did you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think I ever want to go on a cruise. I always hear about entire ships breaking out with sickness and it sounds awful. <endOfText>
<human> That does sound awful!  The thought of being out in the middle of the ocean makes me nervous  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That does sound awful!  The thought of being out in the middle of the ocean makes me nervous <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, too many scary things can go wrong! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor keeps parking in my parking spot! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really annoying!  You should confront him and request he stop. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have asked him a few times, but he obviously doesnt care. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me really angry.  Call a tow truck to teach him a lesson. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I backed out of a parking spot and tapped a parked car.  It left a dent bit I left without notifying the owner.  It was not an action I am proud of. <endOfText>
<human> Why didnt you want to notify or leave some sort of little note on the car?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't want to take responsibility, which I know is wrong. <endOfText>
<human> happens sometimes just dont know what to do in those moments.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why didnt you want to notify or leave some sort of little note on the car? <endOfText>
<human> I didn't want to take responsibility, which I know is wrong.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> happens sometimes just dont know what to do in those moments. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I feel horrible and small for doing that and not fessing up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A time I felt lonely was when I joined a video game lobby. There was not a single person in it and I felt alone... <endOfText>
<human> That seems like it'd be strange. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it was weird. When I joined it said 3/25 people but when I got in it, there was no one. <endOfText>
<human> well, you could always have left. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two daughters are musicians. <endOfText>
<human> Do they play any instruments? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my wallet the other day, and of course didnt remember it until I was about to pay at the cashiers line! <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens, did you have to put all your stuff back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yup, and have everyone behind me annoyed with me and all of that fun adult stuff!! <endOfText>
<human> Well it happens to everyone at least once probably, so no worries. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> happens all the time in the city i live in, people are rude!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> happens all the time in the city i live in, people are rude! <endOfText>
<human> Definitely, I didn't lay on the horn though, that just makes it worse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate a restaurant this morning and had soup. Their Sriracha bottle looked like it was 1000 years old and I wanted to vomit. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didn't use any. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad I lied to my friend. <endOfText>
<human> What did you say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked home one day after work and saw that my window had been smashed out. <endOfText>
<human> That would freak me out.  What was it form? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little on edge when I dropped my daughter off at a movie with her friend alone for the first time <endOfText>
<human> What were you on edge about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling down a lot lately. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. What's wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used the bathroom at a grocery store and had to poop really bad. I commenced pooping and starting humming a song and didn't realize there was a person 2 stalls down from me. <endOfText>
<human> Ha, that sounds comical. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my mother so I didn't have to take her to the doctor's by saying I had an appointment of my own. I think that was pretty crappy of me. <endOfText>
<human> That was pretty crappy. What did you do instead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a co-worker who's totally incompetent that makes more money than I do. <endOfText>
<human> That's got to be frustrating for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know being a parent is so hard, but I feel so lucky to have my children especially in stressful times... <endOfText>
<human> I have felt that way sometimes too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when you need them the most they are there, i hope they always keep that same attitude as they get older. <endOfText>
<human> I am trying to teach that to my children. They are stubborn <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up today and took a warm hot shower. I was so thankful for warm water, let alone being able to shower. <endOfText>
<human> It is great to appreciate the things that we often take for granted <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was terrified when I heard strange noises outside that seemed really close <endOfText>
<human> That's never good. What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not happy when I didn't win the award. <endOfText>
<human> What was the award? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for the sun. It gives us sunlight for food, warmth, and so much more <endOfText>
<human> I like to tan in the sun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I literally had the worst day every yesterday at work, but when I came home my entire night was made perfect! Guess what I had waiting for me? <endOfText>
<human> No idea, what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A spotless clean home, and HOT dinner on the table. Its priceless to get hot food when you are a mom. lol <endOfText>
<human> I love having a clean home and warm food! No better feeling. Did your husband do this for u? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mortified when my pants ripped while getting out of my car <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what did you do ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been thinking back to my childhood lately. <endOfText>
<human> What prompted that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been single for quite some time now, but I know its not over for me <endOfText>
<human> Me too. We just need to keep at it and not give up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched the first Spiderman with Tobey Mcguire yesterday. Such a flashback to the past. <endOfText>
<human> I used to have the DVD but I sold all of the to upgrade to Bluray. I havent seen that in forever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really excited when Friday came <endOfText>
<human> What's going on on Friday?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What's going on on Friday? <endOfText>
<human> I was headed to vacation at the end of the workday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a lot of food from a restaurant with coupons yesterday. When I got the food, they didn't even ask for the coupons! I did not expect it. <endOfText>
<human> What! You still got your discount tho right? So you get to use them over again!?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What! You still got your discount tho right? So you get to use them over again!? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I got the discounts but I think they forgot to ask for the coupons. I get to save it for another time haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago it was the anniversary of my mothers death and it never gets any easier. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, I love my mom so much I can't imagine her being dead... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure you already do but just spoil her a lot and always let her know you care! I wish I had more time to do all of those things for her. <endOfText>
<human> I will def do that, I need to be more grateful for while she is alive. Thank you for that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is always there for me when I've needed them. <endOfText>
<human> That's what family is for! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to get a job with real benefits soon, I'm very optimistic for the future. <endOfText>
<human> great, I hope it works out for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two daughters make me happy in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, kids are a blessing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really touched to watch my daughter program <endOfText>
<human> Wow, she is talented. Is programming difficult/? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got her license, and we live in a busy city but I think shes going to be okay driving. <endOfText>
<human> Driving in the city is challenging, I hope she does ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Especially in ours the drivers are terrible here no one uses the signal light! Thanks! <endOfText>
<human> There's also a lot of one ways in the city too. She's going to get used to it, it should be fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a lot of my muscle mass because I lost motivation and stopped lifting weights. I used to be a decent size in the past so that gives me assurance that I can get back to being big like before. <endOfText>
<human> I hear it is harder the second time around to get into shape but you sound motivated!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear it is harder the second time around to get into shape but you sound motivated! <endOfText>
<human> Maybe but from what I heard, you still have the muscle memory in your fibers to get big so it should be easier. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad bought me my first car, and I wont ever forget how happy I was. <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling but I crashed my car my dad bought for me like 1 year later. But that feeling of happiness was awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah for sure I wont forget it! Sounds like you have an experience to remember too! <endOfText>
<human> A bad and good experience haha. Drive safely unlike me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got everything I need for a quality work session this morning. My coffee, a hot shower, and some food/water. Should be an efficient day! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like an amazing day honestly... i hope tomorrow goes the same for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds like an amazing day honestly... i hope tomorrow goes the same for you. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you. Do you have a morning ritual like me also? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got startled the other day while walking in my yard. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get started doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I peed in the sink because the bathrooms were full and i really had to go <endOfText>
<human> You have to do what you have to do. Did anyone walk out and see you? lol  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You have to do what you have to do. Did anyone walk out and see you? lol <endOfText>
<human> no they couldnt the way the kitchen sink was situated. but i did not want to hold it in too much longer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to finally step it up, and work on my fitness routine to achieve results. <endOfText>
<human> wow i am impressed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am with myself, and sure I am going to follow through! <endOfText>
<human> what are your long term goals / <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I submitted a form to receive notifications for my banking app. I don't know why but the waiting got me feeling antsy.." <endOfText>
<human> It's always a pain waiting to hear back from a bank.  I always think something's gonna go wrong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my bar exam. <endOfText>
<human> Is that to become a bartender? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A little random but when I was a kid I wanted the new Hulk movie that came out. I went to the store and I picked out the DVD and begged my mom to buy it. She did and I went home to play it on the TV. Turns out I bought the old 1980's version and I was so disappointed! <endOfText>
<human> Was it good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends went out last night without me, and didnt even bother to ask me if I wanted to join them. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, they don't sound like good friends to me.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it made me feel really bad especially since im new to the area. <endOfText>
<human> You should give them the cold shoulder next time you see them. That's what I would do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, they don't sound like good friends to me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it made me feel really bad especially since im new to the area.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am felling so chill right now since I have most of my bills paid <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I bet you feel like a weight was lifted off your shoulders! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the new Insurgency Sandstorm video game to come out on Steam. It was supposed to come out this summer but no news yet. <endOfText>
<human> There is a lot of buzz for that is there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset the baseball game got canceled. <endOfText>
<human> I don't watch a lot of baseball but was it an important game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have a car anymore but I am satisfied without having one. I don't drive a lot anyway and everything I need is in walking distance. <endOfText>
<human> I do not have a car either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally have a closing date on my home, and i cant wait! <endOfText>
<human> i know that feeling, congraz <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thank you! yes its a great feeling. i love it <endOfText>
<human> your first home ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I owe my friend a pretty big amount of money. I was supposed to pay this week but they said they will give me another month. Did not expect that at all. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you're relieved!  Good friends are like that though, especially if they know you're struggling.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you're relieved!  Good friends are like that though, especially if they know you're struggling. <endOfText>
<human> I know, I am so surprised they gave me another month. I am thankful for his understanding. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back when I was in the Navy, I hated studying for promotion tests, so you can imagine my reaction when I got selected. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no haha, were you prepared for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when you have to wait for the results of creating a new bank account. The waiting is killing me! <endOfText>
<human> Waiting always kills me! How much longer do you have to wait?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Waiting always kills me! How much longer do you have to wait? <endOfText>
<human> No idea, I'm checking my email everyday waiting for the results. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember one night I was hanging out with friends, and got a phone call that the ambulance was at my parents home. <endOfText>
<human> What happened?!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out he had a stroke due to the heat ( also his breathing problems COPD ) <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's never good. Is he doing fine now/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I had to drop my son off for daycare the first time <endOfText>
<human> its a part of life you know <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> was proud of my child, she got all a's in school this year <endOfText>
<human> that is outstanding! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to one of my friends, and I feel bad about it. I just  dont know how to tell her the truth. <endOfText>
<human> Just tell her? She will be grateful for the honesty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh... shes literally about to get married and her boyfriend has been cheating on her. I am scared to even bring it up. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that's rough. I wouldn't know what to do either. It's like you choose to be a good friend and destroy their marriage or let her get married so she's happy. Goodl uck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a biggest spider in my shower this morning. I never knew I could shriek like that.. <endOfText>
<human> Did you jump out or did you brave the war and kill it!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Public speeches always get me. It makes me very nervous and I just can't do them. <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way. I have social anxiety so standing in front of a crowd is pretty terrifying.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel the same way. I have social anxiety so standing in front of a crowd is pretty terrifying. <endOfText>
<human> I will start speaking gibberish and sweat bad. Not only that but my face turns so red!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing baseball and failed to catch the ball, which smacked me right in my mouth and broke one of my teeth! I just wanted to run and hide! <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, I hope you have insurance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have a car anymore but I'm perfectly fine with a bike now. Everything I need is pretty close to my house. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good everything is so close. It really helps out a lot and walking is good for you!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats good everything is so close. It really helps out a lot and walking is good for you! <endOfText>
<human> I agree! I need to start being more active anymore so there's that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt cheat on my diet even tho I was tempted at a party yesterday... <endOfText>
<human> Resist the temptation! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am I am! Its so hard but I am. <endOfText>
<human> Food is the worst too because all that junk food is all around us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really excited to see all my daughter's hard work pay off at the recital <endOfText>
<human> I love those moments where you get to see all the hard work get payed off! How did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I procrastinated and didn't do the dishes for a couple days now. I think fungus started to grow on some of the old food, so nasty! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  I bet you regretted that fast! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to hold my nose shut while doing the dishes. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds bad. It was probably harder to get off too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been single for some time now. It really sucks... <endOfText>
<human> How long are we talking about ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been a bit down lately. <endOfText>
<human> What's wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother asked me if I was the one who took his sunglasses. I did take his glasses but I told him no and now I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> It's hard to admit when we are wrong. DO you think you will fess up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope I will be able to afford a vacation during Christmas break for my kids <endOfText>
<human> I believe in you! Where are you planning on going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother needed help moving out of her house and I ignored her call while at a party. I feel so bad because there is no way she and my dad would be able to move the giant furniture.. <endOfText>
<human> Have you called her back since then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm always trusting of my wife and daughters. <endOfText>
<human> You guys sound like a strong family! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when I wsa told my boss was let go <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not expect France to win the World Cup. It's been a while but I still can't believe it considering a lot better teams made it to the semi play offs. <endOfText>
<human> That was crazy!  I agree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really upse when I found out my co-worker was fired <endOfText>
<human> Was it their fault? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thankful for my dog. Whenever I am lonely, she comforts me and I feel happy again! <endOfText>
<human> What type of dog is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents have been a big letdown in my life. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had crab legs for lunch. <endOfText>
<human> I have never had any. Is it similar to eating crawfish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel bad whenever I cheat on my diet. It's so hard to disciplined with all the temptations around me. <endOfText>
<human> I am with you right now! However tracking carbs accurately in an app has been a gamechanger this week <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy I got to see my cousins when they came in town <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! How old is your cousins? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet at a store that I frequent near my home. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you get it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the worst and busiest day at work yesterday, and when I came home my house was a mess because my wife decided she didnt want to do anything that day. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe she was tired or something. Don't make her feel bad, just encourage her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know its so hard though after you have had such a crap day, and then you come home to that. I wasnt hard on her just a little moody about it! ugh <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling. It's part of being human though and I hope you guys worked it out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am assured I will do very well on my exams tomorrow. I have prepared very well all night. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you will! You seem prepared.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you will! You seem prepared. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you. Wish me luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish it was next year already. <endOfText>
<human> WHat are you anticipating for next year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty sure I was going to get a good grade on my paper <endOfText>
<human> "was" pretty sure ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see homeless people, I am so thankful for where I am in life. That could easily have been me, they just got the bad roll of the die. <endOfText>
<human> It's such a terrible situation. You just never know what circumstances have brought someone to where they are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was overcharged at the grocery store but did not realize it until I got home. <endOfText>
<human> That suck's, have you tried calling the bank to let them know about the mistake? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't until next summer! This past summer was such a happy moment in my life! <endOfText>
<human> What do you do in the summer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid of death. <endOfText>
<human> Who isn't? I am scared of death because I don't know what will happen afterwards. I fear the unknown. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I listened to some old music I used to listen to recently. It literally made me feel like I was reliving the past! <endOfText>
<human> Music can do that to you sometimes. I listen to mine regularly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lot of people have no concept of personal space anymore. <endOfText>
<human> I know right. If you invade my personal space, prepare for backlash. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to fart in a meeting room and it ended up being really loud.... and there was a lul in the conversation so everyone heard it <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh!  I would be mortified!  Did your face turn red? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like collecting survival items in case of an emergency! I will be ready for any disaster or zombie Apocalypse that comes my way! <endOfText>
<human> What all do you have stored so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when I see people get bullied. It makes me so furious! <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I do not like that either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not like being bothered when I am working. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, it throws my frequency off.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too, it throws my frequency off. <endOfText>
<human> I try to shut my door but people still knock on it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've done a lot of extra work this summer. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of work did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is about to start. Summer is over. <endOfText>
<human> Bummer. I enjoyed summer so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm optimistic about my finances. I've been trying hard to pay back the debt on my credit card. <endOfText>
<human> You can do it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really proud of my sister when she graduated <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were. That is a great accomplishment!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you were. That is a great accomplishment! <endOfText>
<human> It is.  I am pretty happy for her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a nice letter in the mail today, when's the last time you got an actual letter? <endOfText>
<human> Like years. I use emails a lot but I don't feel the need to use actual paper letters. It's 2018! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing people in great physical shape makes me so inspired. Also, lowkey envious! <endOfText>
<human> It seems like an almost unachievable goal, especially at my age. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a beautiful sports car <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun.  What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my daughter babysit my youngest daughter for the first time <endOfText>
<human> That must have been nerve-wracking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just sit at home all day alone. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I feel you bro. It's ok at least make sure you are being productive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog loves to hide whenever she has to poop or pee. So I always find hidden treasures around my apartment and boy is it gross! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds gross lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed my high school reunion <endOfText>
<human> Those are always so much fun. Catching up with old friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got promoted at work last week but I was not. We started at the same time so it makes it kind of hard to be happy for him. <endOfText>
<human> That is disappointing.  Is there other things you can apply for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My just graduated from high school in the spring. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! You must be excited to start your career. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the Frozen Four. <endOfText>
<human> What is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little nervous about driving on my tire <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened? Everything ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It keeps getting low and I have had to fill it every day. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you can bring it to the tire place. Maybe they can patch it real quick. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I got a new table the other day. I just stubbed my toe on it running across the room. It really hurt. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I hate that feeling.  Is it better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was watching the news but not paying much attention,when I heard a familiar voice, and when I checked it turn out to be my neighbor, that was being interviewed. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, what was the interview about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so relieved to be working from home full time now <endOfText>
<human> are you making good money though ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i finally felt comfie taking my shirt off at the beach, i lost my beergut <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  Well done! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt just call to tall me that she will be visiting next week. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you guys enjoy your visit! Are you guys really close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was packing for a move to a new city and I stumbled upon my old diary. Brought back so many memories. <endOfText>
<human> You must have felt nostalgic of the old days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was more than ready for my first day in my new position <endOfText>
<human> What position was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think work is finally starting to pay off for me the way it should. <endOfText>
<human> That is great! I bet it feels good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just won a math competition in his school! <endOfText>
<human> That’s great! I bet he is ecstatic! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy to have my nephew spend the weekend with me <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great!  How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been somewhat uneasy about money lately. <endOfText>
<human> have you thought about investing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the garbage to the dump a couple of days ago. one of the bags broke and spilled all over the bed of my truck. <endOfText>
<human> thats awful, did it clean up easily? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found the sweetest restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope you enjoyed the food.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really liked being able to coach my daughters softball team <endOfText>
<human> Nice, softball is fun. I used to play baseball but always had fun playing softball in gym class <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did too.  It is cool to work with the kids too <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it's rewarding teaching kids and helping them learn how to become functioning human beings. I have a 2 year old nephew who's nuts and asks questions all the time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a phone interview for the job and after going through a ton prior to landing that job I was happy to be able to get the job. It was interesting because the job involved using an app on my phone as part of it to complete my work every day. <endOfText>
<human> That’s interesting. What did you have to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've just recently got my pilot's license! I can't wait to hit the skies! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing. I have only been on a few planes in my life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dialed the wrong number today. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, did you apologize to the person after they answered or did you just hang up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a brand new car for cheap! <endOfText>
<human> That is something I need too.  How did they get new so cheap? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty thankful to live close to my sister <endOfText>
<human> It is very important to stay close to family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really is. Our kids can play together often too. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful to hear.  When times are tough, family is all you have in this world. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm glad to have a lot of work to keep me busy <endOfText>
<human> You don't get any free time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met my daughter;s teacher tody. <endOfText>
<human> Did you like them okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love spaghetti so much. <endOfText>
<human> I do too.  I have a fantastic recipe <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty disappointed when I found out I was passed over for a job <endOfText>
<human> OH that sucks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know. I really thought it was in the bag. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think the other person deserved it at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty upset when my friend lost her husband. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is. The hospital was negligent. <endOfText>
<human> That's really bad. What is she going to do about it> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought so much junk food yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Have you eaten it all yet ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a big scare a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not a very good cook and everyone knows it. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are good at many other things though.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure you are good at many other things though. <endOfText>
<human> Well at parties and pot lucks I am asked to bring the wine and punch. Never a real dish <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> was very sad to hear of my friends passing <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry for your loss. That sa to hear. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you.  He was a really good man. <endOfText>
<human> It must be really tough. It will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just lost another bet to my sister. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea? What was the bet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That my mom never worked at McDonalds when she was younger. <endOfText>
<human> Everyone's got that low minimum wage job at one point in their life sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sleepy but have so much work to do. <endOfText>
<human> Take a power nap. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just ruined a carton of eggs. <endOfText>
<human> That’s no good. How did she do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad that I couldn’t be there for my friend when she went to court <endOfText>
<human> Did everything go okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it went well. Thank you <endOfText>
<human> Your friend probably understands if you couldnt make it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let one rip during dinner just now. <endOfText>
<human> lol c'mon man, show some class. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I havent seen my cat for days <endOfText>
<human> Did it escape your house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I was the only one to think to bring Smores supplies on our camping trip! <endOfText>
<human> Smores are a must when camping. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the street the other day and I found 20$ just sitting there on the ground! I was so happy! <endOfText>
<human> i have never been so lucky. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I order a burger today with no onions. I am allergic. <endOfText>
<human> Allergic to onions? I have never heard of anyone with that allergy. Must be tough  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Allergic to onions? I have never heard of anyone with that allergy. Must be tough <endOfText>
<human> Not if I don'te eat them. There were so many onions on that burger. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother built a fence all by himself. Saved himself some money from having to hire people <endOfText>
<human> I would love to do that. Did it cost him much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once put our fishbowl in the window so our beta could get some sun while we were gone all day. <endOfText>
<human> Hoping the beta was okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got home and everything looks like it got a fresh paint. <endOfText>
<human> Did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought it was really cool when my friend offered to buy me a car if he won the lottery <endOfText>
<human> That would be nice, but it's highly unlikely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know. The though was cool though. <endOfText>
<human> It sure was. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is working on a school project without having all the information on it. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds familiar.  Is there someone she can get it from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I yelled at my mom, because I was sleepy. I feel so bad. <endOfText>
<human> What did you yell at her for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros for the nintendo switch <endOfText>
<human> Mario is such a classic. Haven't played smash since gamecube I think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my friend's senior ring that she left behind before going to college. I miss her. <endOfText>
<human> Why don't ou call her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I voted today and can't wait to hear the results. <endOfText>
<human> Oh. Who did you vote for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, we have a councilwoman who has been arrested for drunk and disorderly several times and she wins the election every year. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What does she do that peole would vote for her every year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I considered becoming a vegan, but I'm not so sure if it'll work out. <endOfText>
<human> I have never tried and never will lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like the idea of it, for moral reasons, but I can't imagine I'd like any of the food. <endOfText>
<human> That's what I think. Plus I'd miss bacon too much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My four year old drew a picture of me today. <endOfText>
<human> You must be his role model! That's awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting a shipment from my mom. I'm so excited! <endOfText>
<human> What's inside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> Appreciate them while they are with you and try not to worry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to pick up my kid, and saw him helping a pregnant lady carry her stuff. <endOfText>
<human> Well you seem to have done a great job parenting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I look through old family pictures and get nostalgic about holidays. <endOfText>
<human> Do you guys still spend the holidays together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I threw away the safety deposit key. it's worth $500 to replace it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is what you have in there worth more than 500? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is being bullied in school day after day. I've gone in and had so many meetings with the principal but it keeps happening. I. Am. Fed. Up. <endOfText>
<human> I hate bullying. You should talk to the kiids parents. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the students registering today. <endOfText>
<human> For college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way. Everyone isn't as fortunate to have family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I Can;t believe my favorite show is ending. <endOfText>
<human> What show is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working hard to meet my work goals this summer. <endOfText>
<human> What are your goals? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There were 6 kittens in front of my doorstep this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Are you keeping them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disappointed with the new Mario Tennis game, it did not live up to my expectations <endOfText>
<human> Oh. How was it different to the previous ones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking forward to hanging out with my friends but looks like I'm stuck at work <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, why are you working extra? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going on vacation this weekend. I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> Where are you headed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was proud of my friend when he was the high school valedictorian, he did a great job! <endOfText>
<human> That's an incredible achievement. He must've worked really hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried spincah alfredo for the first time the other day. <endOfText>
<human> how did you like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A major health win for me, I quit smoking a few weeks ago after 30 years. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I have been trying. How did you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a day off tomorrow after 3 straight weeks of work and my throat is starting to bother me! Figures! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, I hope you feel better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The adoption people called me about the dog we applied for. Think we're getting him! <endOfText>
<human> What dog breed is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is super smart and younger than me <endOfText>
<human> It sucks, but sometimes you just can't compare yourself to other people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just went through a break up. Think some good movies and food are in order <endOfText>
<human> That's tough, it's good he has a friend like you to help him out though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to buy stuff for a party, I knew he'd come through though. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to have reliable friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is dyslexic and has ADD, with a little work he ended up winning his spelling bee! I'm proud of him! <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing! I'm happy to hear that. I can relate, I feel like I have undiagnosed ADD. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While in a grocery store I told my son he couldn't have the snack he asked for, and he began screaming at the top of his lungs! <endOfText>
<human> I can relate to that! It's so mortifying because everyone begins to look at you like you're a bad parent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a new hotel that's been headhunting me to work for them, but I think I'll stay at the one I'm at now. They've been good to me. <endOfText>
<human> I'd probably stay loyal too, after weighing the pros and cons, making a list for myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disappointed with the new Mario Tennis game, it did not live up to my expectations <endOfText>
<human> I have not played it. Are you going to go back to the last and quit playing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been going through some financial troubles, but my family has come through. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good. I hate that your having difficulties.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea. I wish neither of us have to go through tough times. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah its tough. But, we just got to keep working. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats good. I hate that your having difficulties. <endOfText>
<human> Yea. I wish neither of us have to go through tough times.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away a week ago. Feels different not having anyone to come home to <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry. I know the feeling, Im really sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other night I literally fell asleep at my computer writing the first paper of the semester. When I woke up I knew there was no way Id finish it before the due time and so I got ready for my first grade of the term to be a doozy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. At least, you've got some other assignments to bring that back up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am nervous because I am having a surgery tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> is it a major or minor surgery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> Families are really precious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This girl fell during a race, and everyone stopped to help her. <endOfText>
<human> That is very sweet of them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> That's really sweet, I think most people feel the same way as you. Families are really important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is getting married, I'm so excited for her! <endOfText>
<human> When is she getting married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been faithful to my girlfiend of almost 3 years <endOfText>
<human> So many people cheat nowadays. That's good to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our fence fell down. It's going to cost so much to get it fixed. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good, how much will it cost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Broke up with my girlfriend last week. I don't have anyone to do stuff with anymore. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, why did you break up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think surgery is so gross.I know it is helpful but I can't help it. <endOfText>
<human> It can help, but I could not watch it... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. I think family is very important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> Our family are the first people in our life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found the gift my little brother gave to me, when he was 6 years old. <endOfText>
<human> Is it still in good shape? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really care for my girlfriend, she is so sweet <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How long have you two been tegether? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has been traveling for work, and he still manages to take care of his sick mom <endOfText>
<human> That is a big burden, hope he is holding up okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my girlfriend, we have ben dating for almost 3 years now <endOfText>
<human> Thats really good. Trust is important in a relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hopeful for the new pokemon game, I think it could be good! <endOfText>
<human> I think I haven't play pokemon since Gameboy. What will this new one be about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just graduated from nursing school while working fulltime <endOfText>
<human> That is a good accomplishment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just adopted a dog. I can't wait to see him! <endOfText>
<human> What type of dog is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> How many people are in your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend gave up his dream school to go to a local college so he can stay close to his mom. <endOfText>
<human> Thats sad. But, sometimes people need others to help take care of them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I killed my friend's cactus <endOfText>
<human> How did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to meet up with my volleyball team today, but I'm so tired. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you so tired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely before I met my girlfriend and all my friends <endOfText>
<human> People come into our lives for a reason sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad I'm near a Taco Bell and Chipotle. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not much for eating out, I heard Chipotle is good though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone play an entire song by themself at a talent show once. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice. What instrument did they play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just came home to so much cake! <endOfText>
<human> How did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend said she wanted to talk to me. No idea what it could be about. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a guess? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my girlfriend, I am very grateful for her <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. How did you guys meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've never been to Washington, DC before. I'm pretty excited <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting, what are you doing there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend and I are planning our weddings at the same time but she has a much bigger budget than I do. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, must make you feel bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got 3 quarter pounders and 3 big macs. This is gonna be good. <endOfText>
<human> That is a lot of food, hope you can eat all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am grateful for my girlfriend, she is one of a kind <endOfText>
<human> she's a lucky girl. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my girlfriend, I am very grateful for her <endOfText>
<human> That's nice to hear. How did you guys meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Loaned my friend 10k. My family said I shouldn't have, but I think he'll come through. <endOfText>
<human> That is a lot, I hope he does! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't find my phone anywhere. Everything is in it! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, have you tried calling it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> They must have really been there for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I invested 5k in different stocks <endOfText>
<human> That's a lot of money, how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You wouldn't believe my night last night. I went home, and my entire house had been cleaned from top to bottom. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. So who was the fairy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost the shoes my friend bought me. <endOfText>
<human> were they expensive shoes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely before I met my girlfriend and friends <endOfText>
<human> When did you meet them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell asleep during my date last night. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the lake in my old neighborhood and thought about my childhood buddies. <endOfText>
<human> How was that? Must have been a throwback! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The local restuarant near us is closing. I thought business was good. <endOfText>
<human> What is it called? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt confident when I aced my job interview <endOfText>
<human> I hope you get the job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy to have the family I do. <endOfText>
<human> Good, how big is your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel pretty alone when nobody is home. <endOfText>
<human> i like alone time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was making fries and started a grease fire but luckily I always keep a box of baking soda on hand when I cook and I was able to quickly put it out. <endOfText>
<human> That is super unfortunate, did you manage to save any of the fries by chance?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did, it was just one of many batches. I usually have to go through like 10 or so every time I make fries. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad that you did not lose all of them, it would be terrible if you did all that work for nothing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is super unfortunate, did you manage to save any of the fries by chance? <endOfText>
<human> I did, it was just one of many batches. I usually have to go through like 10 or so every time I make fries.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad before I met my girlfriend, I did nothing interesting <endOfText>
<human> Why not? You only live once get out. Make the most out of every day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want skydiving a couple weeks ago! I had to put a lot of faith into my instructor! <endOfText>
<human> i bet that was fun, were you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally left my dog outside in the heat for too long recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Was he OK?  I hope there was no permanent damage! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife talked me into bungee jumping a couple weeks ago! It was insane and I was scared out of my mind! <endOfText>
<human> Wow I could never do that, I really hate heights. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my friend isn't really my friend at all. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This tax war that US has started is borthering me because prices are now increasing because of it. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it sucks. I have noticed it too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago I was on a bus trip. I had a ticket back home for a late bus but I wanted to leave earlier. There was an earlier bus that was supposed to be full. I decided to take my chances and try to get that earlier bus. I asked the driver if there was any chance of getting on and to my surprise I was able to! <endOfText>
<human> You really got lucky that day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so lonely. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone around in your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son graduated from high school this year. I was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> How happy you must be! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home the other day to find my brother waiting for me! I had not seen him in almost 5 years! I couldn't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> Aww how nice of him! I bet you were happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A toddler was eating something that he took from the floor. His mother was not paying attention to what he is doing. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hate when I see that happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to visit with my mom but we hadn't been speaking in awhile so I was nervous. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds troubling. How did your visit go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was okay, a bit tense but mostly okay. <endOfText>
<human> Well that sounds like it worked out fairly well fortunatley. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had my third job interview this month yesterday! It's been really great having so many job interveiws and I've gotten positive feedback from all of them! I really think I'm going to get one of these jobs! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hope you do get the job! What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just can't wait until this weekend! I am going on a trip to the Bahamas for a week! I can't stop thinking about it! <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my friend's birthday cake on some kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that's horrible. Was the kid ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend told me that she has a crush on me. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like her too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a lot of people voting today. I voted early. <endOfText>
<human> Were the lines long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked a girl out for dinner today, and she turned me down while a lot of people overheard. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A homeless woman asked me for money for food and I said no. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My moms friend had a son that passed away the other day from Cystic Fibrosis. The last time I saw the friend was when she was pregnant with this child (her only child), but my mom felt we needed to appear at the viewing anyway because of the bond they did have 16 years ago (when he was born). <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is sad. It was hard when she told me and my mom to enjoy my son because she will never have grandkids. I think my heart broke when she said that. <endOfText>
<human> It must be devastating for her. Do you think she'll be able to overcome the loss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend graduated valedictorian while working full-time during his junior and senior year. <endOfText>
<human> Your friend must be superman! (or woman) Lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed the sale at the supermarket. <endOfText>
<human> That's always disappointing. What were you wanting to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to face my fear of heights. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool. What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rode a taxi one day and ended up not having enough to pay the fare. The driver was nice enough to offer to cover my fare. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I"m surprised. Didn't know they were that generous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very proud when my 6th grader made the A honor roll last year. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, you must have done something right to make a kid so bright. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss wants to talk to me after lunch. I don't know what it could be about. <endOfText>
<human> It could be something good maybe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through a hard time but praying helped me to feel strong enough to get through it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you got through it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son tried out for football at our community center <endOfText>
<human> How old is he? Is he excited?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How old is he? Is he excited? <endOfText>
<human> he's 4. He just wants to run around and play. I'm the one that's excited. And I know nothing about football. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You will grow to love it. Football is amazing sport. Your son will love it. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so. I just wish it would get cooler outside before they start practice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently bought a brand new Mercedes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm supposed to hang out with my friend, but's like 15 minutes pass the time now. <endOfText>
<human> Are you anxious about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally have enough to buy a new computer. <endOfText>
<human> Yay! Congratulations! Have you been saving for awhile? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was running late this morning and went outside to find a nail in my tire. It was flat. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. I hate that. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to put the spare on and take the damaged tire to be fixed. It was so frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that happened. How much did it cost to repair? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually wear my pajamas when I drop my son off at school since I don't have to get out. <endOfText>
<human> Pajamas are comfortable. No shame in that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got $20 worth of Taco Bell. I haven't ate all day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! You must've been hungry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the food bank for some formula today, because I ran out unexpectedly. I am glad they were able to help me. <endOfText>
<human> Some organizations are really life savers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah exactly, my town is full of wonderful people who are very charitable, pretty much everyone here volunteers and participates. <endOfText>
<human> Not like mine then. So many fronting to donate, but they're actually stealing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is getting really old. He's always been there for me, so I'm going to take care of this little guy as best I can in his last days. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that but he is lucky to have you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have to go to the doctor tomorrow to see if I have strep throat. I hate when they have to swab the back of your mouth to "make sure" that it's strep so they can treat you. Really hoping to avoid that this time around. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, the trouble of going to the doctor just to "confirm" its strep throat is the worst. It's like I know I have it, just help me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog wants to play tug of war with me with this little rope toy she has. But when we played last night, she got so wild and energetic, that she started attacking my other dog! Not sure if I should do it again.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! maybe she needs a break for a wahile <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went grocery shopping like I usually do today, but I did something different. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's curious... By different, what do you mean? Did you buy different stuff, or go to a different store, or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law lived with us and she was so lazy, she slept in until five pm everyday on our couch with the curtains drawn and expect us to all just stay in the dark all day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, that's so annoying! How did you deal with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so pleased with the service I received from the delivery company when I bought my new stove! <endOfText>
<human> Well that's good, are you enjoying the new stove? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I borrowed a friend's hammer and broke the head off <endOfText>
<human> It is always a bummer when you borrow something and it breaks right away. You feel responsible and have to replace it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is always a bummer when you borrow something and it breaks right away. You feel responsible and have to replace it. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, exactly. Apparently, he really loves that hammer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man yelling at a little boy for no reason. <endOfText>
<human> Were they related? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't heard back from my mom yet. Wonder if she's ok <endOfText>
<human> I hope she is okay also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone is my neighborhood has a nicer car than me. <endOfText>
<human> Must make you feel jealous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On my way home from work today I had to wait a really long time for the train the ended up being super crowded due to a police investigation somewhere down the line. <endOfText>
<human> That is weird.  Do you know what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when I realized I had a $100 bill in an old pocket <endOfText>
<human> Wow that would be a really awesome thing to discover! Did you use it for something fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy when I spend time with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> You guys sound really happy together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went rock climbing, and remembered I used to climb with my brother all the time <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds so scary! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got me a new phone. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's awfully generous of them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well that's awfully generous of them. <endOfText>
<human> It is. I didn't even ask for it, and it's not a special occasion. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to reach out to my estranged mom, but she insulted me and refused to speak to me. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. I'm so sorry you had to experience that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haven't seen my friends in a while, we had such a great time at the lake. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. When was the last you have seen them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a mistake at work but everyone blamed a coworker. I feel so bad about ir. <endOfText>
<human> Will you explain it to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed my friend's phone call. Her car broke down. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes. Did she have to walk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a nice time with my aunt going through my uncles things after he passed <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. What did you guys find? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my grandma in 5 years. I'm so excited she's coming to visit. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. I loved spending time with my grandma! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You would not believe this girl! I was at my kid's graduation. Afterwards, my mom and I went up to congratulate him. I was just about to hug him and one of his ex's pushed me and my mom out of the way, jumped on him, and wouldn't let him go for 10 minutes! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new Call of duty is going to be the bomb <endOfText>
<human> Nice. Did you pre-order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was digging my nose thinking I was alone. <endOfText>
<human> I know where this is going lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not impressed when I realized that I left my badge at home <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you need it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ruined dinner tonight I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> What happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Bright side, it would have been a great excuse to order pizza. <endOfText>
<human> That's exactly what I did lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been letting a stranger stay with us this past couple of days <endOfText>
<human> A complete stranger? How the heck did that happen? I'm sure you must be confident that it's safe, if they're staying with you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate trying to apply for jobs, putting so much effort into it, and then not getting any sort of response back. It's like, yeah, okay, I understand if you can't hire me, but can you at least tell me that you're denying me, and maybe why, too? <endOfText>
<human> I think we're just another number for them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been waiting for a story to finish, but the author passed away <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Which author is it? That really stinks when you can't finish a story. An eternal cliff-hanger. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad just walked in with a piece of cheesecake only for himself! Cheesecake is my favorite dessert! I really wish I could have gone to Cheesecake Factory with him. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. He didn't get you one, hu? Thanks Dad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It warms my heart to have my parents to have such a good relationship with my kids <endOfText>
<human> It's great that your kids are having such a great relationship with their grandparents. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is going on vacation out of the country with her friends for 2 weeks <endOfText>
<human> That is a long time.  What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My exroommate was horrible! He refused to shower. We were lucky to get 1 shower a week out of him. And he refused to clean up after himself <endOfText>
<human> That's insanely gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids are gonna take care of me when I get older. I just know it <endOfText>
<human> That is a great thought! What makes you so sure? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I saw a bat in my kitchen last night <endOfText>
<human> Ugh that would freak me out! Did you ever find out if it was a real bat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was about to go to bed when my mother in law called with the shocking news that my sister in law was pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> Why is it so shocking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am anticipating a really long day tomorrow and it makes me nervous <endOfText>
<human> Oh. What's happening tomorrow? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a statewide licensing test last week. I had to study really hard for it. But in the end I was rewarded quite well. I got the highest score in the entire state! <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing, did it lower your insurance rates too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a long walk and couldnt get home on time to get to the bathroom. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That sounds awful. Were you able to stop on the way home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first time I spent the weekend at my boyfriend's appointment, I was greeted by flowers all through the apartment and my dog had treats and toys waiting for him <endOfText>
<human> That sounds wonderful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds wonderful. <endOfText>
<human> It really was so sweet. He still spoils us rotten. I haven't quite gotten used to it yet lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Saw this guy ate 3 bowls of large pho. <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow, that's impressive. I bet they had to be carried back home. Did they even break a sweat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On the way home on my bike, I couldn't hold it in any longer and I... went to the bathroom on myself. #2. It was horrible. I had another mile to go before I got back to my house. So much to clean up. I felt so mortified! <endOfText>
<human> Oh god, I've been through that. At least, a bike is easy to clean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's birthday soon. I want to be a better person. <endOfText>
<human> Make that wish when you blow out the candles <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss when my toddlers were tiny babies. <endOfText>
<human> aw how old are they now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor's party is still going on. I need to wake up early tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> What time is it there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lie to my boyfriend constantly. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just left for the Army. He is going to have an amazing career. <endOfText>
<human> He's definitely going to learn a lot. How long will he be away for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Let my 16 year old brother borrow my car to take his date out. <endOfText>
<human> Did he take good care of your car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had to give a presentation for my group at school. Think I did well. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Did you get nervous prior?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome. Did you get nervous prior? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea, I'm super nervous in front of a lot of people, but I prepared a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone in my family snuck $20 out of my wallet without asking me. It had to be one of them, because it's been here on the counter all day, and I know I definitely had two $20 bills in there. No one will own up to it... <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. If you can't trust your family how can you trust. Are you going to say something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when the Ice Cream Man used to come down my childhood street. <endOfText>
<human> Those were the days. I remember buying 25 cents popsicles. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You wanna know what takes me back to those days? <endOfText>
<human> What is it?  am curious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when I realized I left my door open at night <endOfText>
<human> Wide open? Or just unlocked? That's crazy! I guess you got lucky you didn't get robbed or have some animals become new roommates. Hard to believe decades ago people loved to go to bed with their doors unlocked. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was wide open <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! That's scary. I bet you won't let that happen again. Well, I'm glad everything ended up okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my brother's children are going to have to be put up for adoption soon. He and his wife just aren't fit for parenting, as they fight and get drunk all the time. It's a shame, because I love the two nephews myself, and I hate the thought of not being able to see them again. But it may be for the best... <endOfText>
<human> That is really a shame.  Too bad they won't get help for the kids <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was notified that I did not receive a promotion at work. Really sucked. <endOfText>
<human> That is so disappointing. Will you stay there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband always stops at the store on his way home from work. <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice! What does he usually get at the store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents threw a surprise party for me last night. I was so happy! <endOfText>
<human> I love a good surprise party. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY ex has a gambling problem. Thats why we broke up <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. What game did she used to play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yup. Because as soon as you give him a sweet stack of cash, he's probably going to blow it at the slots. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly. He is just doomed.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad at the democrats. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at my cable company!  My internet and TV keeps going out and their technicians are incompetent! <endOfText>
<human> I am having a similar issue.  You shouldn’t have to pay for a service they aren’t providing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having a similar issue.  You shouldn’t have to pay for a service they aren’t providing. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, but they never credit me anything for the lost service time!  It makes me see red! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pretty excited to go shopping <endOfText>
<human> Shopping is fun!  What do you plan on getting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It felt great to see my son graduate. Like I succeeded as a parent. <endOfText>
<human> That <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That;s awesome. high school? <endOfText>
<human> Yes. College is the next big step! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest daughter got the last spot in her pre k class. <endOfText>
<human> In terms of grades or something else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my baby didn't weigh enough so I devoted my time to helping him catch up. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome that you devoted time to care for him!  How is he doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe how nice that car was!  She did really well getting that new car. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's cool, having a nice new car always feel so sleek and cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There once was a hurricane approaching my area. <endOfText>
<human> Ah! That's always such a scary thing, because there's such a dreaded anticipation that goes along with it, a whole, "Will it? Won't it?" kind of game of seeing whether it will head in your direction. I live in the southeast, so I've dealt with worrying about plenty of them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little boy is testing to see if he can get into a prestigious private school. Really hope he gets into it before the school year starts! If he does, they say kids from these schools are set and will easily get into a good college <endOfText>
<human> I really hope he gets accepted! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the new season of this is us <endOfText>
<human> I've never watched it but i've heard it's really good. Maybe I should give it a try <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting my new job tomorrow. I've never been so nervous in my life. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Four more days and the kids ar back in school!! yay <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What do you plan to do with a house empty of kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stayed home from work today because my son was sick <endOfText>
<human> Stressful. Was your work understanding? Is he ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever had strawberry shortcake ice cream? <endOfText>
<human> Like the creamsicles? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Took the trash out yesterday and it burst all over the ground. I was pretty peeved. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that.  It will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I proposed to my girlfriend the other day and she said yes! <endOfText>
<human> Nice and congrats! How long have you been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to his 8th grade graduation.  Such a handsome boy and I'm glad he's doing good in school.  He's going to high school now! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry who is going in too 8th grade? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I have worked hard and lost some weight and toned up a bit after a year of not working out. I finally feel good when I go out in public instead of gross <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow that's amazing!  Good on you!  How much weight have you lost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got up on stage and completely made a fool of myself <endOfText>
<human> Where were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids go so crazy when they have any sugar. <endOfText>
<human> I always hide my sweet whenever I buy any <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> these people at work are so disrespectful and racist!! I can't wait till i quit! I'm an armed guard and they want me to help customers to find products and i'm not there for that!! <endOfText>
<human> Hmmm sounds like an unpleasant job. Maybe they ask you for help because you're the only one around? It doesn't hurt to help those in need. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran a red light yesterday because I didn't think anyone was out on the road at 2AM. But a cop managed to nail me. <endOfText>
<human> oh man, i'm glad you didn't get into an accident though. please be careful next time. did he give you a ticket? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset the Jonas Brothers broke up. <endOfText>
<human> They did!  That is so terrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby walked for the first time just the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That is cool, did you film it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get scared when moving to a new neighborhood. <endOfText>
<human> That's typically a nerve wracking experience. Did you meet any kind people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a physics test tomorrow that I have been studying for non stop. I feel really good about it. <endOfText>
<human> PHysics? I'm glad I never took that class. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to graduating next year. <endOfText>
<human> What is your degree in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma died last month and now we are sorting through her things. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It has been kind of fun going through all of her old family photo albums though. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's one nice thing to enjoy. That's sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to have a baby and I wanted to do it without medication. i was not sure if I'd be strong enough but I was optimistic stil <endOfText>
<human> I bet you did great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't end up making it haha but I went further then I had in any of my previous pregnancies at least. <endOfText>
<human> But that is still okay. Either way you accomplished something difficult! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY new neighbors just moved in downstairs. <endOfText>
<human> Have you met them yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an argument and lost my temper. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. We're all human, and that does happen sometimes. I guess all you can do is do your best to not say or do anything you can't take back. Is everything resolved now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still have the first Valentine my daughter ever gave me <endOfText>
<human> Wow. How old is she now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got onions on my burger I order today and I hate onions <endOfText>
<human> Why did you ask for onions then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling down since my pet died. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY new neighbors have a nice car. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What kind of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shy when starting a new school. I did not know anyine <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know what you mean! Its so weird because for that first month or so you like dont even fit in.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My street almost flooded very bad up to my garage because of the heavy rain today. I have things in my garage that I wouldnt want to get wet and didnt even think it could flood. <endOfText>
<human> I do hate flooding as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be the skinny one in my friend group. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter painted me a picture the other day <endOfText>
<human> Did you love it? That was sweet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I ate 12 buckets of KFC. Feels bad man. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my lord! How are you still alive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little nervous for placement testing <endOfText>
<human> How do you think you did once you took the test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its been almost a year since my granny passed. I miss her so much <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. I bet you you miss her. That is so hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working really hard in school lately. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry about that. I hit some wrong keys. It is a psychology class. <endOfText>
<human> Psychology made me sleepy lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss living in the city. <endOfText>
<human> Did you move to the country? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im glad I still have my parents around <endOfText>
<human> Some people are less fortunate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt alone when my friends were gone for the summer. I felt like I had no one to hang with <endOfText>
<human> oh no, what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hopeful when the raptors got khawi leonard <endOfText>
<human> They might win the east <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt contentment when my brother was going to get married. I just felt glad for him <endOfText>
<human> Congrats for your brother! When is the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my friend that I was busy last Friday night, but really all I wanted to do was stay home. <endOfText>
<human> Staying in is good sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always donate my old things <endOfText>
<human> That is commendable.  I try to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "i was happy when Lebron signed with the lakers <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah! So was I. That was so awesome!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah! So was I. That was so awesome! <endOfText>
<human> yea i hope they take down the warriors <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so frantic when I am late for appointments. I had an eye doctor appointment and was 15 minutes late. <endOfText>
<human> what ended up happening <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought the eye doctor was going to be upset, but they were fine with it. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good customer service is important to me. <endOfText>
<human> It's important to me too, since I work in customer service.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's important to me too, since I work in customer service. <endOfText>
<human> I have always stayed loyal to stores who have great customer service. I can't spend my money somewhere where I am treated poorly <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an interview for my potential job tomorrow and have been practicing in front of the mirror all day. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you get the job. Just don't be nervous . It shoes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went skydiving the other day and was so frightened to take the leap out of the plane. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you, that feeling is the worse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I see a very expensive car on the road, I get so envious! One day... <endOfText>
<human> I do too. What is your ultimate dream car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going hiking with my friends tomorrow. I have everything I need and I forget bug spray like last time! I am ready! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds pretty neat! Where are you going to hike? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I have a dark confession to make. I ate 24 burritos from Chipotle the other day. Felt so bad about myself. <endOfText>
<human> I hate overeating especially when I'm on a diet. I feel so guilty about it all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I managed to bag 50 squirrels the other day when I was hunting. I felt marginally bad. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to eat them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in dried dog poop today on my way to my car. It was so nasty! <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that is some nasty stuff. Did you take your shoe and shove it in the face of your sworn enemies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son spoke his first word yesterday. I was so impressed and proud. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! How old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt ready when I went to work <endOfText>
<human> Work is always so boring for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really happen I got to keep my computer when i moved. <endOfText>
<human> why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love that my extended family likes to keep everyone together <endOfText>
<human> Yes that is awesome!  I bet it makes for good times! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was under the influence and facebooking LOL.  Not something that should go together but I was kinda mean to an ex coworker when she asked me to write a letter of recommendation for her <endOfText>
<human> oh wow.  Haha  Did you talk to them and make it right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when i didnt win the lottery! <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, I hope you win next time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Public speaking makes me so nervous! I get very sweaty and start to shake uncontrollably... <endOfText>
<human> I hear ya.. practice makes perfect tho! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wedding is tomorrow and I've been going over my vows over and over. Never felt so ready! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ove binge watching tv shows <endOfText>
<human> Me too. What kind of tv shows? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for simple things like clean water, some people in Africa have to walk miles just to get that! <endOfText>
<human> tell me about it! It's good that you appreciate these things <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i gained so much weight and i look so horrible... it's embarrasing <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling! Eating is so addicting... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy to have a home in a good neighborhood <endOfText>
<human> how long have you been there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe the lakers will crush the warriors! <endOfText>
<human> You really think so?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You really think so? <endOfText>
<human> no but i hope so! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for invention of cars! Can you imagine have to walk or take a bike to places very far away? <endOfText>
<human> I couldn't. I would love to be able to walk to work, but it's just too far. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY son went to the potty all by himself today. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats awesome, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to attend a funeral and left my dog with a sitter.  When I came home 2 days later he was so happy to see me!  It warmed my heart ;) <endOfText>
<human> Dogs are loyal like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so loney out here. My closest neighbor is two miles away <endOfText>
<human> Hey that makes for peaceful living doesn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have a car anymore but I'm ok with that. I'm perfectly fine with my bike because everything I need is very close to me <endOfText>
<human> That is a great place to be.  Sometimes less is more.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a great place to be.  Sometimes less is more. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I am perfectly content with having to ride a bike at the moment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always and will always be true to my loved ones. I would never jeopardize their trust. <endOfText>
<human> You sound like a very faithful and loyal person! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling lucky to not have plans <endOfText>
<human> I like not having plans too. I enjoy just relaxing sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad was recently diagnosed with diabetes. I'm really worried what this will mean for his health going forward. He's in his mid-60's and I want him to live as long as possible, but this obviously gets in the way of that. <endOfText>
<human> My dad has diabetes too but he was born with it. I heard veggies help a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There has been a fly in my room that won't stop landing on my face. I am about to lose it... <endOfText>
<human> That's one of those things that never gets old to complain about, because it's one of life's time-tested annoyances. And what's worse is you open the door or window for them, and they still refuse to leave... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I was eating dinner and my dad kept laughing during it, and I wondered why. Turns out he accidentally dropped the plate of meat on the ground outside after grilling it, but decided to serve it to us anyway! <endOfText>
<human> That is hilarious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate all of the ice cream last night. <endOfText>
<human> All of it! Dang.. I bet someone wasn't happy about that. Unless you live alone, in which case, no big deal. Did you just feel like eating it, or were you feeling sad about something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im geting a new car this year. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what type of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom has been very depressed lately with her work lately. They randomly changed her schedule and she is having a hard time adapting. <endOfText>
<human> that sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> WE didn't swim all summer! <endOfText>
<human> That sucks! Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love watching old movies I've seen a long time ago. I notice things I didn't pick up on when I was young. It was like reliving the past. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. I do it all the time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neigbors are terrible <endOfText>
<human> What's wrong with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work in retail, but the otems arent that hot and the staff is rude. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks man. Why don't you get a new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter said her first word yesterday. I was so proud. <endOfText>
<human> that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that;s terrible <endOfText>
<human> What? No it isn't. It's good that she is learning how to talk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is awesome. <endOfText>
<human> So is mine! What makes yours awesome? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared when I watched the new Insidious movie. I am such a scaredy cat! <endOfText>
<human> I do not like those movies because of that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was let down when my aunt missed my graduation. I really wanted her tehre <endOfText>
<human> Why was she not there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a visit from my uncle I wasn't expecting <endOfText>
<human> Well, I guess that might have been a nice surprise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my shift was over <endOfText>
<human> I can undersatnd that.  Big plans or just relax? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start camp this weekend <endOfText>
<human> band camp? you know what happens at band camp. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for the camping trip this coming weekend. I made a list of what I need and I'm pretty sure I'm not forgetting anything. <endOfText>
<human> where are you going camping? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very envious when my friend got a new car that I wanted. It was just maddening <endOfText>
<human> what kinda car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was irked when the lakers got Lebron <endOfText>
<human> They wont win anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure my neighbor will return my lawnmower in it's original condition. <endOfText>
<human> Let's hope so. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like anyone in my apartment unit. <endOfText>
<human> Not even friends or faimly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to let my dog back inside yesterday before I went to work. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea did he run away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes he did and we did not find him until the next morning. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe that I have such kind parents <endOfText>
<human> That is a great thing! What do they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I also have a great parent. However I got a bit too mad at her when she threw away a lot of moneys worth of special vitamins accidentally. <endOfText>
<human> oh no that is not cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was saddened when my dad got in trouble. It just gave me some shame <endOfText>
<human> What did he do if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran a blatant red light today. I felt so bad about it afterwards because someone could have gotten seriously hurt. <endOfText>
<human> Its okay, you can learn from it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying not to beat myself over it but I can't stop feeling so guilty over it. <endOfText>
<human> You will feel better tomorrow <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family and friends threw a party for me out of the blue. Did not expect it at all and I felt so appreciated! It was an awesome night yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great!  You must have felt amazing!  Was it your birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I did something at work that I am not too proud of. I went in my coworkers desk and took some supplies. Now, it is eating me up inside. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you felt guilty about it afterwards. Just let them know you needed it really bad at the moment and maybe return it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to go to my son's AIT graduation with my parents. And then they said I could go but I couldn't take my service dog. <endOfText>
<human> That's not fair <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sister was recently fired. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am listening to some music I loved 5 years ago. I feel like traveled back in time, I miss the old days... <endOfText>
<human> That always makes me feel nostalgic too.  What kind of music is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had to attend a funeral of a family member in another state.  I haven't seen some of my family in a couple years or more.  It was nice getting to see them again. <endOfText>
<human> It was nice seeing them dead right? Just kidding, I know you meant other people at the funeral haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got a brand new computer! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told myself I wouldn't eat after 10 pm yesterday and I already broke my promise. I feel like I've let myself down, again. <endOfText>
<human> Its okay, you can learn from it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty worried about being home alone <endOfText>
<human> are you living alone in general or do you get anxious when you are alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two dogs got into a fight with each other, and now they're avoiding one another. They even drew blood on each other during the fight. They're usually good buddies, so it kind of bothers me that they did that <endOfText>
<human> That is too bad. Are they getting along now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the store the other day and made a mistake. <endOfText>
<human> The sounds like it might be bad... What was the mistake? Maybe you're overthinking it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Here I am, another night all alone. You ever feel like you will be alone forever? <endOfText>
<human> I often dream of ending my own life because of being alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray that the sun rises for another day for me. <endOfText>
<human> Stay positive and hopeful! What's wrong ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't seem to keep any weight off. My friends can keep whatever they want and not gain anything! I am so frustrated... <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Do you know the reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to babysit for my niece this weekend <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like so much fun? How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son used to give me such a hard time in the morning when he had to get up for school. <endOfText>
<human> I experience that too.  It is frustrating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank goodness since he has gotten older he has grown out of that. <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I hate my life because of certain circumstances but I've learned to be happy with what I have. I just need to be more grateful I think <endOfText>
<human> You do just need to accept it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was excited in a surprising way when my brother came to my graduation. I was not expecting him there <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. How long has it been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my best friend's other friends was talking bad about her to me. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's awful.  How did you handle it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever just sat on the beach for a whole day?  It's so relaxing. <endOfText>
<human> I used to live right by the beach. You just described my daily life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to snuggle all day with my little boy tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Aww I miss my kids being little and having snuggle parties! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my 20th class reunion last year <endOfText>
<human> that sounds exciting.  Did a lot of people show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very convinced that I have severe trust issues. It's really hurting my relationships with other people. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry! I can relate to that to some level, as I often feel leery of other's intentions as well. Any reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had food, water, and a place to sleep last night. I need to be more thankful for stuff like that that I take for granted... <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to appreciate things like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when my mom wanted to get a divorce. My dad did so much for her <endOfText>
<human> Wow, she is so selfish <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hoping the lakers crush the warriors! <endOfText>
<human> LOL I'm not a fan of NBA that much but I do know I don't like Golden State <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to drive 5 hours the other day to attend a funeral of a cousin of mine.  It was a sad day.  Got to see family though. <endOfText>
<human> oh im sorry to here that. always good to see family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember back when my mom made me a birthday cake. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of her! What flavor was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex roommate was so nasty. He refused to clean and only showered once a week <endOfText>
<human> That is so disgusting! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my grandma passed away. It was so random <endOfText>
<human> How old was she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some random guy at the gas station asked me if I wanted to see a ninja flip so I thought it can't hurt to see what he was talking about for a few seconds. He did the most insane flip I have ever seen in my life! <endOfText>
<human> That is very random but very cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm still single. I am optimistic that I will find the one for me soon... <endOfText>
<human> I am too.  I don't go out much so maybe you should make sure you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Make a point to do that even if you don’t feel like it <endOfText>
<human> It's hard to do it when your mind is playing tricks with you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet dog, Gabe, passed away recently. I have been so down lately because of it. <endOfText>
<human> oh im sorry to hear that. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when I didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry.  I hope you didn't get your hopes up too much.  The odds of winning are really low! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in school I cheated on a test. <endOfText>
<human> Who hasn't cheated on a test at school? You'll be fine, don't feel so guilty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a pretty well-built person at a restaurant today. If only that was me!! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you look fine! You can get built if you want to! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't follow through on my diet plan and ate too much. I am feeling very let down <endOfText>
<human> Diets always such honestly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend left me after a long time being together. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, I hope you find someone else <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My upstairs neighbor kids are so rambunctious and loud. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes, kids can be a lot! apartments should always have kids on the bottom. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I completely agree! The parents don't watch the kids and let them do whatever they want. <endOfText>
<human> I don't know why some people have kids! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the grocery store today and a very young bag boy helped an older man run his food card. He was having such a hard time. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of him! That's not common to hear about young people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when one of my employees submitted his two weeks notice yesterday <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Listening to feel good music makes me feel so good. I don't about you but music can really cure a lot of negative emotions <endOfText>
<human> yes, who do you like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting everything together for my meeting tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> What is your meeting about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My exhusband was a soldier who was gone a lot. It got lonely. <endOfText>
<human> I can feel your pain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am single and wish I had a girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. I am sure you will get one soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared when my dog got loose <endOfText>
<human> That is really scary, did you find them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got angry at my brother one time when he ruined a football game score that I had recorded <endOfText>
<human> why did he do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's always a shock finding dried poop hidden away in my apartment. My dog is so sneaky!!! <endOfText>
<human> how big is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not too big but you should see the size of the poop. <endOfText>
<human> i can imagine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when the Lakers got lebron <endOfText>
<human> I don't watch basketball. Is that bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My exhusband left me for his best friend's wife on my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful!  You deserve so much better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe when I found out my sister in law was pregnant <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared when that spider ran across my bed <endOfText>
<human> How big was the spider? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so envious of rich people and their nice cars! That stuff is low key inspiring <endOfText>
<human> whats the plan to get into one of those cars?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man blow his nose into his shirt. <endOfText>
<human> Ew, why not a napkin <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was torn away to hear that my dad was having health problems again. It's always so stressful <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  Will he be okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I feel all alone <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, that's terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped on a puddle of water at a restaurant this morning. I'm pretty sure a lot of people saw it and laughed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am sure you were embarrassed.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I am sure you were embarrassed. <endOfText>
<human> For sure. I hate it when others laugh at me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got sick and had to move away from everyone I loved so I could come stay with family. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for the new NFL season to start <endOfText>
<human> When does it start? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend who is kind to everyone, even when they are being derps <endOfText>
<human> that sounds like a good friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when a hamburger was only a dollar. <endOfText>
<human> Inflation sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a homeless person today. I instantly felt so thankful for what I had in life and where I was. <endOfText>
<human> That is a very healthy way to think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend who overshares. <endOfText>
<human> That can be hard sometimes. Have you talked to them about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend took me in when I escaped an abusive situation. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! So many do not have a safe place to go when they leave <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm satisfied with how I'm doing physically right now. I just need to keep at it and stay motivated. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im hoping to win the lottery tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Good luck!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my family way more than i should! <endOfText>
<human> Why, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of my partner that is doing treatment and doing it on his own for once. He never has picked up anything to work on himself..BY himself before. <endOfText>
<human> That is great news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not happy that he didn't go to jail. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an old man using a food stamp card and having such a hard time. I am grateful I am able to afford food. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, me too! That's very sad. We do have much to be grateful for! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A year ago, a tornado approached our house. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were afraid. Was everything fine? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I couldnt believe i didnt win the lottery yesterday!" <endOfText>
<human> I would be far more surprised if you did. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in shock when I saw a car accident on the highway. <endOfText>
<human> was everyone ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at a restaurant this morning and the Sriracha bottle looked like it was 1000 years old. <endOfText>
<human> In a cool antique way or a disgusting way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have lived in the same area my whole life and worked the same job for 10 years. <endOfText>
<human> Is it getting boring? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very irritated when people reach around me to get items at the store. <endOfText>
<human> thats the worst! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a car yesterday that I wanted so bad! <endOfText>
<human> Ooo! What kind was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend left town a couple days ago and he won't be back for over a week. <endOfText>
<human> what are you gonna do? partyyyyy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sometimes I feel all alone! <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. That's no fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are wanting to buy a bigger vehicle soon. It will be great to have more room for our family. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure it will be helpful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when Obama was president. Time really flies. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it seems like that was just a couple of months ago. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad I cheated on my diet. <endOfText>
<human> That is a horrible feeling I know, but you can start over again the next day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids went on vacation with my parents for the week. <endOfText>
<human> Where did they go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We sent off our brazilian foreign exchange student last year.  In line at the airport she gave me her necklace to keep. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah we had a fun year.  I miss her :( <endOfText>
<human> Do you stay in touch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a girl in college and we had a date yesterday. It went very good and I am very positive about out future relationship <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Do you see yourself marrying her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The Dallas Cowboys won a bunch of games last year! <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. I don't watch too much. Are you a fan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very hopeful about the USA economy <endOfText>
<human> I am too, things are going great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel shame for lying to the police. <endOfText>
<human> What did you lie about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out to dinner at a fancy restaurant with my husband the other night. <endOfText>
<human> What did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been wanting a new suv and a few months ago my daughter went and bought exactly what I had been wanting. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what SUV? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I been waiting a while for the official release date for a new video game. There's been a lot of rumors but nothing set in stone. <endOfText>
<human> My sons are always talking about the new video games coming out. What game are you waiting on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It felt great to see my girlfriend finish her painting. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of paintings does she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was worried he wouldn't be liked because of his weight. <endOfText>
<human> That's not a reason to dislike someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray America will be great again. <endOfText>
<human> You like Donald Trump? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Driving gets me so nervous sometimes. At any moment, I know I can be involved in a deadly crash... <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but do you drive safe? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes but sometimes you can't do anything about a drunk driver smashing right into you <endOfText>
<human> True but the odd's are slim. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live alone and I feel lonely a lot! It has it's perks but a lot of down sides too <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that you feel lonely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is coming up next week. <endOfText>
<human> happy birthday! What year is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy I just got a new promotion! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Congrats! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away last month. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I am so sorry! I have lost many this year too. I hope he had a long life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well police never show up in my neighborhood. Never. Even with gunshots going on for hours and we are a small city. <endOfText>
<human> I sorry that you have to deal with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sat home alone on my birthday last year and no one same by to see me <endOfText>
<human> I wish that was not the case, I would have came. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my daughter take my credit card to the mall today for school clothes shopping. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I would have been scared to let mine do such a thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My children are both fast asleep and I am the only one up around my neighborhood at this hour. <endOfText>
<human> Is that relaxing to you or lonely?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is that relaxing to you or lonely? <endOfText>
<human> It is both in a way, more so the second than anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the bar exam last month. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about how I will pay rent on time this month. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, did you lose your job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when I thought I bought 5 packages of gluten free cookies today on clearance...and they weren't! <endOfText>
<human> Didn't you check your bought items more thoroughly before putting them in a bag <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my close friend had somewhat fierce argument about Donald Trump policies yesterday. And now he is not responding to my calls <endOfText>
<human> Thats too bad. I hope everyone remained respectful. Seems like everyone is being kind of childish about politics lately and getting mean fast instead of keeping it decent. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a beach vacation coming up and I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! I am jealous! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids have been begging me to let them stay home alone without a babysitter while I work. They are old enough now I guess. <endOfText>
<human> Do you trust them to be home alone?  I bet you're scared, huh? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am on vacation and I know my girlfriend will get us to the hotel safely. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you guys are always safe! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a test last week and failed miserably. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good. Did you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to a funeral of one of my family members two days ago. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. I am sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start my new job next week <endOfText>
<human> Oh how exciting!  What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my baby's unbmilical cord stump in an old box and it reminded me of when he was little and ne w. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that is so sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend recently bought a new Porsche. <endOfText>
<human> Wow have you gone for a ride in it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate just moved out of our dorm. <endOfText>
<human> Oh is the new extra space a good thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Mcdonald's and they completely messed up my order. <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that. What happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to buy the Nintendo Switch from the store but they were sold out. <endOfText>
<human> sorry about that, did you try checking on another store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lied to me and I was so upset I yelled at her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, did everything get resolved? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I proposed to my girlfriend last week and she said no. <endOfText>
<human>  Oh my gosh, seriously??? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my gosh, seriously??? <endOfText>
<human> I can't believe how hurt I am about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My room mate keeps bugging me to take the trash out but it's his turn. <endOfText>
<human> That is so annoying. Maybe you'd have to get a chart to keep track. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just graduated from college. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! You must be so proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really looking forward to the upcoming NBA season. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, do you love basketball a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling so bad after fighting with my spouse and realizing it was actually my fault. <endOfText>
<human> Did everything turn out okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car broke down on my way to work yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible. Must have been annoying, huh? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling very good right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I already have 6 kids, getting pregnant again is so alarming :( <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds like a very busy household. How are you able to manage them all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my toe last night and it really made me  lose my temper. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch! I know that hurts, been there too. Does it feel better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to go to the movies on my own. I saw the latest art film and had the theater all to myself. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you go to the movies by yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a lottery ticket earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Ooh, did you pick your own numbers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was following this sad story about a missing kid just trying to be optimistic that they'd find them. <endOfText>
<human> was it a young kid? sad nonetheless <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new car and it's great on gas mileage <endOfText>
<human> Ooh how fun you must have many adventures planned. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling really on edge still. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, do you know any way to help yourself calm down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son learned to spell his name all by himself which wowed me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's fantastic! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had all my stuff moved from my old apartment to my new one, but the truck got into a wreck. <endOfText>
<human> Holy heck are you okay? Was it like, a fender bender or a full on collision?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Holy heck are you okay? Was it like, a fender bender or a full on collision? <endOfText>
<human> Full on. The person in front decided that slamming on their breaks at 70 MPH was a good idea. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My idiot manager decided that I could handle working a seven day shift, and like half my days are double shifts. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks! I can barely do 5 without needing a break <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I can stay just one more day i'm so unhappy that I will be leaving today <endOfText>
<human> Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My last semester of school is coming to an end. <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool you are moving into the job market. Yay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't stop thinking about estranged family I was missing one day. <endOfText>
<human> How does it make you feel when you think about them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a bit down in the dumps. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when kids would play out in the neighborhood. <endOfText>
<human> those were the good times, now kids just want to be on their phones <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my favorite perfume and it broke into a million little pieces <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible. Can it be replaced? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma went out of her way to print out and send me some old pics. <endOfText>
<human> That's sweet of her! You should put them all together in a nice photo album. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when a restaurant claims to never have received your online order. And they do not offer to fix the situation! <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that. Sometimes there can be a technical  problem <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very irritated at how my junior colleague never listens to instructions <endOfText>
<human> Some people think they know all the answers. It's sad as they usually don't grow as much as people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If he does not behave himself, I am afraid I would have to write a query so that he is removed <endOfText>
<human> I hope he does, for his sake. But I imagine he will come around <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned my friend a good bit of money, but he does not seem to be in any rush to pay me back <endOfText>
<human> If you report him to his wife, the shame will make him pay you back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in high school, a few classmates and I cheated on a math test. I regret that too this day. <endOfText>
<human> It's a chance to turn a new leaf by  getting a high score even without cheating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready to testify in court against those wicked people that steal in the office everytime <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! Stealing from anyone is a really bad offence.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for you! Stealing from anyone is a really bad offence. <endOfText>
<human> I have proof and they don't know I instructed the security team to record any strange thing and I have it all in camera <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today someone at work at my lunch without permission <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I would have been upset! How did you react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever get all A's back in highschool? I remember the first time I did, the looks on my parents faces. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must have done lots of reading then? i dont get As all the time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did I ever tell you about the last day I got to spend with my grandmother? <endOfText>
<human> No. I hope it was a pleasant day for you and not sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends threw me a surprise birthday party last year! <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broked something at home and everyonw blamed my brother. I didn't say anything. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible! Why did you blame him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time, I was in the elevator with a couple people inside and I accidentally let out a fart. I could not wait to get out of there! <endOfText>
<human> Oh lol, I'm sure it was embarrassing but it's happened to most, so understandable.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh lol, I'm sure it was embarrassing but it's happened to most, so understandable. <endOfText>
<human> I know it that is a common scenario, but I could not stop thinking about that for the rest of the day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will always stay with my husband no matter what, be faithful because I vowed during marriage to be <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same as long as I am treated with respect <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I order something online, I feel so impatient waiting to receive it <endOfText>
<human> I have felt like that as well :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid just completed his last year of high school, valedictorian and all! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. You must be very proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family went on a vacation without me because I had to study for final exams. I have to stay home by myself which feels a bit like I am living in exile. <endOfText>
<human> Awh, that really bites. It's the worst when it feels like everyone is having fun without you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a long trip to Florida coming up.  Don't really like car rides. <endOfText>
<human> What is it about them that you don't like so much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was checking out today at the grocery store and one of my items busted. It went everywhere and the cashier was so rude about it <endOfText>
<human> That's very unfortunate. That cashier needs to find a job they actually like doing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally ran into a glass wall at work. D'oh :( <endOfText>
<human> Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a feeling of great accomplishment at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really?!  Tell me about it I'm excited to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A good friend of mine organized an unexpected birthday celebration for me, it was very sweet of her to do that for me. <endOfText>
<human> You must be a very special person to her. Is she single?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You must be a very special person to her. Is she single? <endOfText>
<human> She is actually in a long term relationship. She is a considerate person though, which is cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very uncertain if the fuel will be enough to drive me to the next station before I can buy <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope you can make it!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If it goes off. I might have to walk for 1 hour to the station <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that's quite a walk! I hope that doesn't happen. Do you have anyone to call for help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I hope you can make it! <endOfText>
<human> If it goes off. I might have to walk for 1 hour to the station  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really thought the Doctor knew what he was talking about. After all he is a Doctor. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sure that I will be able to buy my dream car in 2 months <endOfText>
<human> Why's that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally saved up enough to build my very first PC after waiting several months for it! <endOfText>
<human> That is a great accomplishment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my mom used to make Thanksgiving dinner. <endOfText>
<human> Good memories I take it? I loved not having to make it myself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad for firing her <endOfText>
<human> Was she a bad employee? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No she wasn't <endOfText>
<human> Then what caused you to fire her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family felt me alone for vacation at home. It was boring being alone. <endOfText>
<human> sorry about that, you could have called a friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember being so happy when I was a child during Christmas. I loved opening presents with family and sharing that experience with them. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I remember those days too!  What was your favorite gift from a family member? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got my suitcase packed.  So ready to go! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! Do you know what your destination will be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got a new girlfriend and I have no idea how he does it. It takes me months to find one, and it only takes him less than a week to find a good one! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will find a great girl soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to have back surgery next month. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope it goes well as I've heard those can be tricky procedures <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been able to see Mission Impossible, I was supposed to go a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Really? It is a fine movie <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A guy held a knife toward me <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend borrowed a book from me, but he went and lost it! It was one of my favorites too <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's terrible.  Did he say how he lost it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an uncle I hadn't seen in awhile the other day <endOfText>
<human> How was that for you? Are you close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sad that I didn't drive my mother to the airport <endOfText>
<human> Why? Was it because you didn't take those last few moments to spend time with her? Sometimes we have so much going on, we don't have time to do it all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an emergency at work. I am a doctor and it was a life and death situation :( but now I regret because I could have assigned someone else and driven my mother because that was her life visit <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no, I'm sorry to hear that. You had no idea that would be the last visit, but I can understand how you would feel that way. I have no doubt she understood why you didn't though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm starting a new job in September! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What kind of job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into the ladies room at the store today. It was so gross. <endOfText>
<human> I've never been in one, but I always assumed they were cleaner! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty happy today I would say. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really?  What's the good news? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had my eye on a new laptop for ages, but I could never afford it until now! <endOfText>
<human> What model or brand of laptop were you considering? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really looking forward to my special dinner with my partner! Our ten year anniversary is coming up! <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic! Congratulations! Is it at a restaurant or home prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite horse, Gracie, died the other day <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's too bad.  What was the cause? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can I work so hard and not get a raise meanwhile others colleagues are. I am so jealous what do I do? <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you feel that way. If you feel that you do good, honest work, you should demand better pay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son recently won a swim meet and got first place for butterfly stroke <endOfText>
<human> How long has he been a swimmer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom left me over night with some of her friends when I was 8 years old. I cried myself to sleep. It wasn't until later in life I realized she could have been possibly cheating on my dad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, that's such a heavy thing to think about. Did you ask her or confront her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but she denies it. <endOfText>
<human> Well, I hope they've figured it out together during this time.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I hope they've figured it out together during this time. <endOfText>
<human> They stayed together 39 years and then my dad passed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom decided to give me a precious family heirloom this past Christmas. It was quite unexpected! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a wonderful surprise. Was it something that you had seen before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to renew my drivers license by taking a test. I really wanted to be ready for it. <endOfText>
<human> Those tests can be stressful. How did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet hamster was eaten by a pit bull. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. How that happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister was a little bit depressed, so I bought her gift to cheer her up. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice! What did you get her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After dating my girlfriend for 3 years she still won't accept my marriage proposal, I am so angry with her <endOfText>
<human> Ouch that's rough. Maybe she just isn't ready.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ouch that's rough. Maybe she just isn't ready. <endOfText>
<human> I think she is secretly cheating on me :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite watch the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are you thinking about buying another one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year my mother took me grocery shopping for my birthday <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's... odd.  Was it for a cake? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a game of DoTA today! I can't believe it, it wasn't even my fault. <endOfText>
<human> If it wasn't your fault, then what caused you to lose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I went into a store only to realize that I had on two different shoes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my. How did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog was dying of old age <endOfText>
<human> You will be fine, just get a new one <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked at how fast my hair is growing these days <endOfText>
<human> Really? did you use marijuana ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In a few days I need to go to a company presentation and make a big speech! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I bet that's exciting, but also makes you a bit nervous. Congratulations though, I'm sure you are proud to do it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered for a pizza,she brought a hambugger,i declined it ,she just yelled at me angrily <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope you were able to get over the disagreement. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my recent eye exam, and it went very well. <endOfText>
<human> What's wrong with your sight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not so sure how I feel about buying a used car. <endOfText>
<human> Well, if the milleage is not too much and the car is clean go for it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just gave birth to a bouncing baby boy. I am going to be a proud father <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That is such a big step in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel a bit down in the dumps now. <endOfText>
<human> What's got you feeling down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This lady behind me in Target was driving me insane. I can't believe it. <endOfText>
<human> What was she doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got take out and when I got home I had an extra dessert. I was quite pleased <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What did you end up getting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of my friends moved out of state after college, so I'm really the only one left <endOfText>
<human> That can be sad, but luckily you can plan to visit them in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh, it is so frustrating when you pay extra for express delivery and the shipping company messed up! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea, I've had it happen a few times. It's even worse when they "lose the package" for a while <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This is ridiculous. I have to take my car to the shop again. <endOfText>
<human> I hate having car troubles! What is it this time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling warm with good memories. <endOfText>
<human> Of what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had talked on phone a night before <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish my friend didn't cancel on me last minute, I was really hoping she could go with me to that special concert. <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame. Is there someone else who can go with you? I'm available. LOL <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure she really wanted to go. Sometimes we have to make choices we don't like. My offer still stands. <endOfText>
<human> That's true. Thanks for reminding me about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What was your experience like? <endOfText>
<human> Looking through my picture albums really makes me relive so many memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I waited till i got a call <endOfText>
<human> not for the time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very good about myself now. <endOfText>
<human> I'm happy to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am angry because I didn't get served when it was my turn <endOfText>
<human> What were you expected to be served? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was least expected though! <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? and what was  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why is that? and what was <endOfText>
<human> Was promoted barely a months of joining my new company <endOfText>

<human> Happy birthday to him! What did he get?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Happy birthday to him! What did he get? <endOfText>
<human> He got some awesome gifts like LEGO sets and color books. He really is creative! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the past year, I was caught cheating on my wife. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. Did you have to cheat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling really sick earlier today. I thought I was going to die. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! I hope you are feeling better! Did you go to the doctor to see why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud to have helped the company grow to what it is today. It's time for me to retire after 20 years of decicated service <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's a long time! Kudos to you. It's hard for me to imagine being in one place for that long <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Speaking of, I start a new job tomorrow and I can't sleep. It makes me nervous <endOfText>
<human> You will be alright, it's always like that  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, and I hate it. I wish I could just turn that off sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Think about the positive aspects of this, you are moving forward <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You will be alright, it's always like that <endOfText>
<human> Yes, and I hate it. I wish I could just turn that off sometimes.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel pretty bad about some things I have done. <endOfText>
<human> Really? What sort of things have you done that make you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night was terrible! I heard a huge noise and was so scared I almost pooped my pants. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought someone was breaking in my house! But it was only my cats being crazy. <endOfText>
<human> I see. lol. I hate cats, sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why won't I get angry at you for not passing your exams <endOfText>
<human> OK ,why would you in the first place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's ok <endOfText>
<human> Not just that ,but my important documents that's worth a fortune <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very good about my relationship with my partner. My partner values my opinion about things. <endOfText>
<human> ok, so sweet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling very spooked at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that, what is wrong <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing serious, but I watched a horror film last night and it was very scary. <endOfText>
<human> sorry, those horror movies can scare you to death. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey!  The weekend is coming up :D <endOfText>
<human> Are you high young man? It's just wednesday..hahaha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> t's not unexpected that you are the best <endOfText>
<human> This is true.  I have often been told that I am the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I witnessed a man eat an entire 3 foot burrito the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa! What was in that burrito? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker did an amazing presentation recently. They did a good job. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Never regretted it one bit ,amidst the spate of marital problems these days <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. Don't live with regrets. Learn from mistakes and move on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's certainly not something I would want to live through again. I try to fly as little as possible these days <endOfText>
<human> Why? Did something bad happen to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful I got a new job making more money. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool! Has it been a good transition? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents have been married for many years. I cannot wait to help them celebrate their anniversary this year! <endOfText>
<human> Thats sweet.  How long have they been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I confident  in my children's abilities because I taught them well <endOfText>
<human> That's good! You should always encourage your children's talents and let them grow <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a newly opened candy store near me for the first time. It brought back waves of childhood memories <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's good. You will make some good money while having a good time remembering childhood <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I farted in front of my relatives during christmas dinner <endOfText>
<human> LOL. Sorry. Was it embarrassing or did you laugh it off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The exams will certify me in my profession <endOfText>
<human> That is quite interesting. You must be proud of yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished doing all my laundry and packing for my trip.  Finally.. ready to go! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went camping the other week, and it was so nice to not worry about everything like I normally do <endOfText>
<human> Oh I love camping.   Was it relaxing?  Sometimes camping can be work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life has been kind to me. I am grateful <endOfText>
<human> That's great to here. Anything good happen recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel good and ready for this semester. <endOfText>
<human> You did super well I guess <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my toe this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope your toe is feeling better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew gave me the sweetest homemade gift of a painting he made for my birthday! <endOfText>
<human> Thats so sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was robbed at a fast food place years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was it traumatic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my baby cousin over the other day. He's so cute but he's oh so fragile looking. I had to be very careful. <endOfText>
<human> The little ones always feel so fragile, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, my son did not get A grade in his math class. <endOfText>
<human> What grade did he get? He doesn't have to get an A in everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, I am having issues with financials at college just because I couldn't get a 34 on my ACT. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, You can take it again though and try to get a better grade! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling horrible.. I cheated on my husband last week. <endOfText>
<human> Well, good thing is you realized your mistakes  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, good thing is you realized your mistakes <endOfText>
<human> Indeed.  But now I feel so bad.. I feel like I need to tell him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pleased with my children's score at school <endOfText>
<human> Thats always a good thing.  Did you give them a fun reward? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a dude drop his phone the other day but he kicked it up into the air and caught it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is really impressive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a sweet birthday cake for my nephew, and I was ready with all the ingredients laid out for me. <endOfText>
<human> I bet he was stoked. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I have a very important exam tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, what subject is it on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset when I didn't get to go on this one trip with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> That is sad, Why were you not able to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just confessed that she cheated, im irritated at her behaviour. Totally dissapointed <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear about that.  I hope you both can find a way to work things out with each other. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is no fixing buddy, in my religion once a woman cheats she is not desirable anymore <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's too bad.  Well then I hope you can find happiness again in the future.  Good luck to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took some of my friends food the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you. What type of food did you bring? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I have no friends at my new job <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  Don't say that!  I start a new job today! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend has really been getting on my nerves!  He never throws anything in the trash and my whole place is a mess. <endOfText>
<human> That is disgusting! You must talk to him about this! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had never been to a music festival before, so I was super excited. I was going to get to see my favorite bands, and I was taking a road trip to get there with all of my best friends. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! I've never been myself, but I've always wanted to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh really? You should definitely consider it! <endOfText>
<human> I shall :) I need to make myself get out more. It would be good for me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing some shopping in a thrift store recently and came across a toy similar to one I had when I was a kid. It really made me remember my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should buy it for keep sake  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe you should buy it for keep sake <endOfText>
<human> I thought about it but I'd really have no use for it now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I caught my wife red handed cheating on me I feel so bad <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's got to be very tough! I'm sorry to hear that. How did you respond? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through some old photos of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> oh really find anything cool? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my first year of college i didnt have much contact with people which got old quick. <endOfText>
<human> You must felt really lonely because you need friends in college <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year as a freshman in college I thought I was gonna fail my calculus final so hard. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! So what happened? Did you end up passing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped off the plane and the heat, humidity, and foreign smells hit me like a garbage truck. I was in another world. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you land in then? India or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't face my wife, I had a child out of my one night stand <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so stupid, now I know better <endOfText>
<human> You should tell your wife to clear your guilt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some guy just married my childhood crush! <endOfText>
<human> oh my god!. I hope he loves her as much as you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time in freshman year I got invited to this really shady sounding party. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds kind of worrisome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother finished high school last year. <endOfText>
<human> Did he? Where do you both go to school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was forced into covering for my coworker who was supposed to give a large speech to a packed auditorium. I had no time to prepare for it and really no idea what I was doing. I still had to somehow make my way throught the speech! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds pretty stressful. How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling pretty good after my performance review at work. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I'm happy for you. Will you be getting a raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> SO I was at the mall the other day and saw my ex <endOfText>
<human> Oh that must have been awkward.  Did you two talk to each other? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, my wife took me paragliding yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, where did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really bad about what I did when me and my  brother got new phone cases. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  can't wait to know if my wife is going to have a boy or a girl child <endOfText>
<human> That's a very exciting time in life. Do you have any preference for gender? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want a girl, girls are closer to fathers than sons ..hahaha <endOfText>
<human> I've heard that as well. I'm male I know I was much closer to my mom. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is starting college this fall. The application process was very long and stressful. He studied really hard and did great on his SATs. He actually ended up getting accepted at Harvard! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the money that my parents have been looking for, I feel bad <endOfText>
<human> Oof i know how that can feel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had no roommate my first year of freshman year of college which got quite old <endOfText>
<human> ok how did you manage the situation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked home through the park last night. There was a homless man there who smelled absoltuely horrible. It seemed like he hadn't cleaned himself off at all in months! <endOfText>
<human> That has got to be hard on the poor guy. Did you offer any help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I was cleaning the dishes and lost my wife's wedding ring. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That's horrible! Did it fall down the drain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to spend some time with a friend last weekend but everyone that I tried to get in touch with was busy. That was very upsetting for me. <endOfText>
<human> They're not very good friends then. You should confront them about this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone cut me off in traffic this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, I hate when that happens. It makes me so angry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend borrow my car yesterday and I regret it now. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take a licensing test last week for my new job. I spent hours studying for it and felt like nobody could be more prepared. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, did you get the license? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have worked all week to prepare for the meeting and feel I will do great! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great! What's your meeting about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got crashed into this morning by another car who was texting while driving which was horrible <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Were you hurrt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I am elated that my dad bought me Porsche Macan. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that is an awesome car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cut someone off in traffic this morning, made me feel a bit bad. <endOfText>
<human> You shouldnt feel bad. It happens to all of us at some point. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing that  my wife bought a white color when I  asked her  to buy green disgust me <endOfText>
<human> I would be really frustrated with that as well. Did you exchange the colors? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She promised to go and do that since she realizes how i feel <endOfText>
<human> Well it sounds like she's listening to you at least. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently won a performance award at my job. That made me so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. You have done well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'd been having computer problems for quite a while. Finally I decided to take my computer into a shop. I was shocked at how quickly and fast the tech fixed the computer and had it working like new. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, these shop mechanics can be extremely knowledgeable when it comes to computers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was having dinner yesterday and just stopped for a moment to thank the Lord. <endOfText>
<human> Well that sounds like a good thing to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a friend who was really driving me crazy last night. He was constantly calling me trying to get me to help with a project that he's working on. Unfortunatley I really don't know anything about his project so anything I could do was very limitied. <endOfText>
<human> He should be understanding of that and not keep on. That's just frustrating for everyone involved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone crashed into my parked car yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Omg!, does the place have camera? at least so that the police can track down the person <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The latest models of cars are sophisticated <endOfText>
<human> I agree. Do you have a new car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visitied New York last weekend. The trip there made me remember other trips there that I took with my parents when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> OK let me in on it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad for having a drunken one night stand. <endOfText>
<human> Why does that make you feel bad? You're allowed to have fun sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a new job yesterday. It seems like a great fit for me! It pays so much better and is so much more stable than my current job. I think I have a great chance at getting it! <endOfText>
<human> You must be quite hopeful to get this new job then! I hope you do as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom stayed with me for a few days last week. She was very helpful around the house taking care of all of my needs. <endOfText>
<human> I hope I will still be helping my kids when they are grown up. I like to feel they will always need me.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope I will still be helping my kids when they are grown up. I like to feel they will always need me. <endOfText>
<human> I think they will. Kids usually never outgrow their parents deep down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Now I am getting older, I realise there are things that I miss doing, like playing tennis or football. Maybe I should start again. <endOfText>
<human> You should definitley pick them up again. Don't let age stop you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can you imagine a 60 year old on a skateboard! <endOfText>
<human> lol well as long as you're fairly active and fit it shouldn't be too big of a problem. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My stepfather has been in the hospital this week and I haven't called him. I feel kind of ashamed and awkward about it. <endOfText>
<human> Why, did you hesitate in the first place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> To be honest, I don't really like him. It hasn't been a very good marriage with my mom. <endOfText>
<human> I see than, I could tell you that you should just overcome yourself and do it, but its you own personal business... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I accidentally had an affair with my wife's coworker. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds rough! Have you told your wife about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had planned to get my wife flowers for her birthday but I completly forgot. I feel very upset about having forgotten and think she'll hate me. <endOfText>
<human> Is there still time to get one? You can if you hurry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had so much belief in people that I gave my car to someone and he drove it and never came back with it <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness. Who is that guy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone I met at a religious gathering, so much for trusting! <endOfText>
<human> What an impostor.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This is an important time for our family because our son is applying for colleges this year. We're all nervous! <endOfText>
<human> It's a great stage in your life, what is he majoring in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Most likely he will study finance. His grades are good but not the best, so we just don't know what to expect. <endOfText>
<human> Well I wish luck to both of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very sure about getting to my kid's school before 1am for the parent teacher's meeting <endOfText>
<human> Is there anything that could spoil that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker was given a great work assignment this morning. It seems like she did nothing to even deserve it. I wish I could get such great assignments! <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens.  Things always seem to go that way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love by myself and it gets so boring.  Its just me and my dog. <endOfText>
<human> Your dog doesn't keep you good company? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy.. my sister just had a baby! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats. Boy or girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend went to the hospital last week because of a heart attack! <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that. I hope he is okay now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is next week and its the only thing I can think about. <endOfText>
<human> Well, early happy birthday. What will you do to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is getting ready to go off to college and I find myself so happy and sad at the same time. I'm just remembering all the wonderful times we had with him growing up. It went so quickly! <endOfText>
<human> Well you knew that you would have to let go one day, didn't you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just got a new car. Here I am driving the same car for 10 years. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you. I need a new one asap. POS falling apart. Cost me lots for a repair recently <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've bought a lottery ticket every week for years. This week shockingly I bought the winning ticket! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, how much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agreed to watch my neighbor's cat last week while she was on vacation. Unfortunatley I forgot to do that. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to the cat?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a brand new car the other day. I parked it in front of my house. Then some neighborhood punks came by and keyed it the first day! <endOfText>
<human> That is so aggravating! I am sorry to hear this happened to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, the workers at my firm have not been performing their tasks to the required standard. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds horrible. Are you trying to motivate them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As I opened ,it was a friend I had lost contact with for about 20 years <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, that is along time. Did you feel nostalgic?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my, that is along time. Did you feel nostalgic? <endOfText>
<human> Who wouldn't? He just showed up like a ghost from the blues.. Lol! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up with a pimple on my face and brother won't stop teasing me about it! <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling! Maturity I suppose <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling like I have not been the best roommate lately. <endOfText>
<human> Why, what did you do, to feel like that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got a care package from my sister who lives overseas. She didn't tell me that she was sending it. But it really delighted me. <endOfText>
<human> You are so lucky to have such caring sister <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died, I feel so lonely <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry to hear that. How long did you have it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been attacked last week by robber with a knife. I am still terrible afraid of getting out alone. <endOfText>
<human> I really hope you are alright. Did they catch him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is really sick right now with a fever. I've been taking care of her day and night for the last week. <endOfText>
<human> Are't you afraid to catch the fever? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so confident and then three people stepped up and I knew we had the title. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean they stepped up but you still had the title. Wouldn't they be the ones with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally yelled at an elderly person becuase I thought they were being mean to me when they were trying to help me while I was driving. <endOfText>
<human> oh what were they doing to you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was making gestures as I was driving past and I thought he was telling me to slow down. I wasn't going that fast and it distracted me so I got upset. Turns out, he was trying to tell me of severe weather in the area. <endOfText>
<human> oh , elderly people are little tough to understand  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was a very nice man in the end and I apologized profusely. <endOfText>
<human> yeah thats very nice to apologize to elderly people  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh , elderly people are little tough to understand <endOfText>
<human> He was a very nice man in the end and I apologized profusely.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the fall, i had a week off and I didn't make any plans because I was pretty broke. My oldest and best childhood friend flew in from where they live in Europe to spend the week with me- they didn't tell me they were coming. It was wonderful! <endOfText>
<human> oh wow.. where did you all go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The best part was just seeing each other- it has been five years. We didn't really do much, all our time was spent chatting. <endOfText>
<human> that was so great of your friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was shocked when I didnt win the lottery!" <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I'm sorry. It  sure would solve a lot of problems, wouldn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, I brought dishonor on my family by not getting A in my math class <endOfText>
<human> oh wow, you should have known better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy last week when it was fridaaay! <endOfText>
<human> i agree, I love Fridays, Did you have any plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of my friends are taking summer vacations. I've stayed home and have nothing to do because nobody I know is around. <endOfText>
<human> why arent you taking a vacation with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to do anything for my best friend's birthday this year. I've known him for a long time but it just completly slipped my mind this year. <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 5 what? <endOfText>
<human> 5 hundred thousand dollars <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was at my sweet sixteen birthday party, my crush asked another girl out. I felt terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have a back up plan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, we still had the party. I didn't like another guy. I just felt bad. <endOfText>
<human> Well, now you that such is life, it makes plans for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was mad when I woke up and it was only Tuesday!" <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I dislike Tuesdays because they are so far from Friday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I heard a loud sound coming from my kitchen <endOfText>
<human> was it a bear? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids got me started watching the show America's Got Talent. It's really quite amazing how many talented people are out there! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes. I love that show I can relate to real life families. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents decided to send me to a new school out of the area <endOfText>
<human> a better school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when i woke up and it was friday! <endOfText>
<human> what are you looking forward to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> And that resulted to an agruement <endOfText>
<human> what did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've put in like 10hts of studies daily <endOfText>
<human> I can not even imagine one hour! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that.I know how it feels,especially with the family concerns <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My appartment was robbed last week. The police called me to tell me that theyprobably found some of the objects that have been robbed. I hope it is true. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that is terrible I hope you recover everything that was taken from you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I have a really essential certificate exam tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! Have you studied for it? Do you feel prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I walked through the park to get some fresh air. I saw a mother beating up her kid in the park. I can't believe that some people really will do that. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds aggravating. Did you say anything to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when it was only tuesday! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, Tuesday is just the beginning of the week and more to go. Is that why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very proud to be able to make that importante change at work and I think that my boss will do something for me. Maybe it will be a raise in my salary. <endOfText>
<human> It always feels exciting to do something big at work. It always feels good to feel like you are making progress in your career.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It always feels exciting to do something big at work. It always feels good to feel like you are making progress in your career. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, and my collegues and friend are very happy too. They see me as a new leader in the group. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Also, maybe this is something you can put on your resume and it will look good in the future. <endOfText>
<human> Sure I will do that. But I really enjoy working at that place and I wish to stay there many years.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I entered a writing contest, but I didn't final in it. I was disappointed about that. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that. You should try again and stay confident. The most important is to try. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's how I feel. Every time one thing doesn't get accepted, I submit something else. <endOfText>
<human> Good. Stay focus and you will have success. We always learn something in our good and bad experiences. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I entered a contest to win a free vacation to Puerto Rico last month. Much to my shock I actually won it! I will be taking that trip at the end of this month! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. Are you going by yourself?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congratulations. Are you going by yourself? <endOfText>
<human> No I'm taking my girlfriend with me. I can't wait! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating one of those ferrero rocher candies once.  A worm was inside it.  It was so gross!! <endOfText>
<human> Eww, that must have so disgusting. You should report this to the FDA. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> haha.  Nah I just threw it away.  It almost made me sick.  It was my fault though since it was a little expired <endOfText>
<human> Oh I see, try and avoid expired food next time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi there, my lovely wife is leaving town next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh?  Where is she going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked to see my dog missing the other day! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no I hope you found him and he is ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are always not listening it drives me so crazy <endOfText>
<human> time to lay the smack down <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the airplane, last week, I was borred by someone knocking repeatedly and aggressively on the toilet door. <endOfText>
<human> what...? you were in the toilet? and they were trying to get in? whut? i am so confused, why would they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, i have made no new friends in my new class <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry. Have you tried to talk to people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking for to my birthday party. It was the first big one I'd had in years. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, it is always to good to celebrate your birthday in a fancy way every few years! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think birthdays are a lot of fun and should be celebrated no matter how old you are. We went to a nice restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> That is quite interesting. I hope your day went very well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I was having dinner yesterday and just stopped for a moment to thank the Lord. <endOfText>
<human> That is gracious of you. I haven't done that in awhile. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought he would not pay back after a long time <endOfText>
<human> Had you lent someone some money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He failed to pay back when he promised he would <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I see -- but did he ever pay you back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was not a lot of decent paying work in my area <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its been a fantasy since I was a kid <endOfText>
<human> oh what was was that fantacy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There always seems to be bad news on TV these days. <endOfText>
<human> Who even watches TV this days? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because history is not made, it is written. <endOfText>
<human> Well if we carry on, the world will not cope with so many people polluting the place. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on my first rollercoaster ride about a month ago <endOfText>
<human> Neat, did you like it/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband has been home working, so the house needs to be quiet. The kids are home from summer break. My dad has been nice enough to take them out and keep them busy so we can work. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great that you have someone to take them out of the house and help out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He has been so wonderful. They are having fun and I don't feel guilty. <endOfText>
<human> Becoming a parent is funny, I used to so look forward to summers. Now, even though its nice to have time with them it adds new challenges. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After months of DIY projects I spent the two days before my wedding getting everything ready. We made all of the bouquets and flower arrangements, my mother an I made all of the food, and we got the reception space ready the day before the wedding. It was a lot but I felt really prepared. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful to have a personal touch for your wedding. It makes it all the more special.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is wonderful to have a personal touch for your wedding. It makes it all the more special. <endOfText>
<human> Everything went over really well, except I put the song I walked down the aisle to on a CD and the stereo we had didn't take CD's! Thank goodness for smart phones, my cousin downloaded the song and had an aux cord so it worked out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of a co worker that got a promotion and not me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, how does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you know today is my birthday? <endOfText>
<human> No, Congratulation. Do you have something planned today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> applied for a job recently and put loads of effort into polishing my CV. I really wanted the job because the salary was really good. I felt like the interview went really well but obviously not because I didn't get offered the position. <endOfText>
<human> oh what really went wrong <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He did not meet up to his project dealines <endOfText>
<human> Are you talking about a co-worker of yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's a source of satisfaction, I must say <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once when I was in high school, I unexpectedly received an award. It was for the work I did for the school year book. <endOfText>
<human> What exactly did you do for the school year book? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I'm a hermit but most times feel sad that I don't have a social life. <endOfText>
<human> I understand <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A fried asked me to make a song intro for an upcoming show <endOfText>
<human> Nice, is that within your skill set? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's fantastic. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you!  I'm going to the show so I can see how it sounds with the crowd going. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to be ready before a long trip. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I agree.  Do you have a long trip coming up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I woke up this morning I just couldnt believe that work had gave me a large bonus! <endOfText>
<human> oh cool, how much did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 150! It was crazy. I was not expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> sweet! so you planning to invest it into something or celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss lied to me. Im so upset about it. <endOfText>
<human> oh no.. what did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He promised he would fix my paycheck, he always does after he makes a mistake then he never fixes it. <endOfText>
<human> he seems like a terrible guy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my temper the other day with my child when she threw food at me, and I felt like I was too mean! <endOfText>
<human> well, we all have that moment in our days.. dont worry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know, but still feels bad each time even if you just raise your voice a little and then see their little face all upset. ugh parenthood is hard! <endOfText>
<human> true.. but it is for their own good only, discipline would help them moving forward <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend move into my house, I own 2 properties and figured she could live there for free because she is having a hard time in life. <endOfText>
<human> thats is really nice of you as a friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I have to believe she wont ruin the house, or her children. <endOfText>
<human> she wont, good deeds arent punished <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a wallet in the subway. Instead of bringing it to an agent, I took it with me. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> You can still turn it in! Just drop it off to the police or the people in charge at the subway.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You can still turn it in! Just drop it off to the police or the people in charge at the subway. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I can do that but I already spent the money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its so hard being alone when you are used to having your family around. <endOfText>
<human> very true.. do you live alone now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No with my wife, and daughter but every year they go to Peru to visit her family for a few weeks and it sucks being by yourself! <endOfText>
<human> i feel you.. but look on the bright side, it makes the moments being together far more special <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So funny story, not funny - careless of me, but still somewhat maybe funny? I forgot to put a diaper on my toddler when she went into the clubhouse pool................... <endOfText>
<human> oh damn.. it is kind of funny yes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You can only guess what happened from there, she dropped it like its hot right in her swimsuit and everyone seen me running with her to go back home ha ha <endOfText>
<human> lol.. i guess that would be a cool story to tell you child when she grows up huh? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a toothache today but no time to get to the dentist. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  Do you have any meds that could help relieve the pain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked upon a snake in my backyard a couple of days ago. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow I really hate snakes, I would've freaked out! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was shocked when i saw my dog missing the other day <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every year my brother tries to top me on christmas with gifts and luxury because he has a super good job! It drives me nuts. <endOfText>
<human> lol, you are so lucky to have such a sweet brother. what do you buy him in return? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh pffft he doesnt do it for me, for my parents lol. He always tries to out do me every year. <endOfText>
<human> haha.. thats hilarious, i thought he was spoiling you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i saw my dog had gotten out <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, have you found him yet?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, have you found him yet? <endOfText>
<human> no... hopefully he returns soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared, but felt so sure of myself to make the long drive across the USA! <endOfText>
<human> wow thats a nice little drive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes it was it took me 6 days, but it was so much fun and I knew I could do it. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow i would think it would take longer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I couldnt believe i got a bonus at work!". <endOfText>
<human> awesome! how much did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up extra early just to make sure I made it to work on time for my new job. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get there on time? I do the same thing, I like to be prepared for any traffic that could pop up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did yes, I felt very ready for the first day. You never know about traffic thats right! especially in the city. <endOfText>
<human> Something always comes up whenever you need to be somewhere! That's how life works! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when I wasnt able to leave work early <endOfText>
<human> oh i see.. did you have any programs planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day, and they were going pretty fast too. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, were you hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait until after work today I get to go pick up my new car.! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what kind is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its a jeep, I love jeeps. 2018 compass <endOfText>
<human> I've never owned a jeep, are they nice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've not been around too many people lately. <endOfText>
<human> Why not? Whats going on?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why not? Whats going on? <endOfText>
<human> Nothing, just haven't felt like getting out lately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god, how so what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh god, how so what happened? <endOfText>
<human> Well we were just driving on the highway and he cut into my lane with just barely enough room. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I swear traffic is the worst in this city. I was almost in a car accident on the interstate going 80 MPH the other ady with my baby in the car. <endOfText>
<human> Wow you too! It's crazy how many bad drivers there are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know for real she was literally right beside me, didnt even look once and just swerved right into my lane - luckily there was no one beside me because i had to swerve to avoid her hitting me it was intense. <endOfText>
<human> Well I'm glad you weren't hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend asked to move into my home that I am selling and live there for free until she can find a place. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that's a tough place to be in. She's very forward for asking something like that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know shes a pretty close friend, but its still scary the thought of letting someone move in. They say dont deal with friends or family when it comes to business. <endOfText>
<human> They do and you never know what could happen, let's say you guys get into a fight and then she trashes your house! Not a good outcome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I blew my budget a little this year and had some financial emergencies so I won't be able to go on a vacation this summer afterall, it's no fun. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks! I cant save money at all I always overspend even just for groceries. I hope you can save up atleast al ittle money and take like a "daycation" !  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks! I cant save money at all I always overspend even just for groceries. I hope you can save up atleast al ittle money and take like a "daycation" ! <endOfText>
<human> That's a good idea, I didn't think about that at all! There are a few cheap things around my city I've been meaning to check out, this is a good excuse for it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! how are you? I'm getting ready to go on a vacation and am really excited! <endOfText>
<human> Cool! Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent weeks seraching for a new tv online <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it can be hard to find the right one at the right price, did you find one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just mesmerized with the kid's performance. <endOfText>
<human> yeah that kid were more lovely and attractive. i was love kids <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She sung a song. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats nice  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very impressed to find out that my partner did not receive any tickets or citations within two years of driving <endOfText>
<human> Same as me! Everyone is always shocked to know that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roomate is leaving at the end of the month to move up north <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to have any other roommate or you will be living alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had picked out some school shoes for my daughter the other day and was waiting for my check to hit the bank so that I could order them. <endOfText>
<human> Did the check end up hitting in time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would be too. ugh that sucks! <endOfText>
<human> She really wanted them too. Now I have to find something else and school is about to start. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my wallet at the store and lost all of my money and id. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That has happened to me before.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah it super sucks because now i have to get my id and social back and all of that! <endOfText>
<human> That is a long tedious process too. You have to have one thing to get the other and they make you run around and get more things. ugh <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. That has happened to me before. <endOfText>
<human> yeah it super sucks because now i have to get my id and social back and all of that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY mother has so many televisions at her house <endOfText>
<human> How many does she have?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a lot wow, she must really love watching tv atleast it gives her something to do tho! <endOfText>
<human> She even has one in the kitchen. I only have one tv in  my entire apartment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for the next 2 weeks. My house is going to be sold, and my wife is starting her new job! ahhhh <endOfText>
<human> That's great. You both must be excited <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are really I am just so ready for it my god i cant even wait!! <endOfText>
<human> Are you moving to a better home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a speech one time in school and I was very nervous for it. <endOfText>
<human> That can be nerve wrecking. How did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a promotion at the casino in town. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Do you visit the casino often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my dog out late last night and a skunk was there. I got scared when I spotted her/him trying to scurry away! <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear! Did you get sprayed? That would frighten me too, especially at night. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got cable in my apartment after 5 years. well, satellite <endOfText>
<human> wow nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the taco Bell breakfast this morning <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! how was that? I have never had Taco Bell breakfast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a huge risk and moved from 1 state to another without a job. I really wanted change in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That is a bold move! Which state did you move to/from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know for real, it took me 3 years just to do it but I had positive vibes. NY to FL! ( running from the cold! ) <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. I have considered moving from Missouri down to either Lower Alabama or Florida.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is awesome. I have considered moving from Missouri down to either Lower Alabama or Florida. <endOfText>
<human> Do it! Its so worth it. :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It impressed me to see Lebron to go the lakers <endOfText>
<human> That's incredible! I would have never expected him to leave Cleveland. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell down the stairs yesterday I was okay <endOfText>
<human> oh my god!!! what happend??? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of myself for winning a medal at the track meet we had last year. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. I never payed any sports. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoyed them because I like competition. <endOfText>
<human> Did you win a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School starts soon. I just spoke with my daughters teacher. <endOfText>
<human> What grade is she in, and how did it go!?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What grade is she in, and how did it go!? <endOfText>
<human> Pre-K. She is excited for school. Turns out the teacher already knows her. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I think a lot about all the little birds in my neighborhood, I always try to make sure I feed them and any critter that comes along. <endOfText>
<human> i love all the cardinals in the woods behind my house <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that dang storm last week upset me <endOfText>
<human> why did it upset you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend went crazy. He stole my rent money <endOfText>
<human> I hope you called the cops on him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping to win the lottery today and quit my job! <endOfText>
<human> I would love that too lol! What would you do if you won? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live alone now and It is hard sometimes but it's good as well. <endOfText>
<human> its a gift and a curse as they say <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As is much of life but it's better to live alone right now and not be abused. I guess I'll take lonely over abuse <endOfText>
<human> thats very true <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got engaged to her girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter left for vacation with her friend. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Where did they go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im glad i'll be able to leave from work on time today <endOfText>
<human> thats great, are you usually not able to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when I didnt get paid my entire check <endOfText>
<human> I would be mad too. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im being evaluated at work soon. <endOfText>
<human> for your job or mental health? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I'm going to be single forever. <endOfText>
<human> Don't say that. There is somebody for every single person on this earth. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone using a trashcan as a drum set on the street yesterday. I was inspired because they were so efficient with what they had! <endOfText>
<human> thats cool.. take any pics? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was ready for that test yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Nice, did you ace it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very taken aback when my neighbor told me he still had his dogs. <endOfText>
<human> What exactly do you mean? Did you expect them to be taken away from him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get stuff for a party, I knew he'd pull through though. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I forget to feed my pets. I feel so bad about that it afterwards <endOfText>

<human> What happens on saturday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I'll forget to feed my dog. I can't help but feel bad about it... <endOfText>
<human> That's not good at all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't afford to go to the salon. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thankful for my neighbors <endOfText>
<human> why what was the reason <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I love my job.  I get to you tell students that they can't take certain classes at the school I work at. <endOfText>
<human> That's great that you love your job, that is really important! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is walking a bit slower these days, he's 15. <endOfText>
<human> what breed is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new Mexican restaurant <endOfText>
<human> I love Mexican food! How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was great!. I had fajitas <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so good.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds so good. <endOfText>
<human> They were so good. I had chicken and shrimp  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on vacation next week. I had been stressing out trying to find someone to watch my dog. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. I love dogs. Do you have any family  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great. I love dogs. Do you have any family <endOfText>
<human> Yes. My sister stepped up and said she would watch him for me! Now I can be excited about my trip! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just purchased my first home. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's exciting! Was it what you were looking for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super nervous about getting on my flight to Peru last week. <endOfText>
<human> That is scary! I've never flown before, the only time I have ever been on a plane was when I went skydiving. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi. I was driving down the road and seen a man beating a dog. <endOfText>
<human> did you intervene? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother likes ordering Hawaiian pizza (with ham and pineapple). I can't even watch him eat it. It makes me gag. <endOfText>
<human> That does not sound good to me, either. I cannot stand pineapple! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoy my job. I get to look after many patients every day. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like you have a fulfilling job. That's great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had to pass all of my classes to graduate. <endOfText>
<human> congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend just published her own book. I don't know how she does it! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What is the name of the book? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I honestly can't remember right now (don't tell her I said that), but I know she worked on it for a long time. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I produce audio and I have an album coming out by the end of the summer! Tell her to keep it up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying to prepare for my grad school interview. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That must be quite nerve-wracking, although I am sure that you will do great! What are you planning to study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was in one of those rent to buy furniture stores the other day and of course I got hounded by a salesman. He was pitching me some unrealistic sounding deal on a kitchen table that I totally didn't believe. It was so hard to get him to leave me alone. <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when salespeople do that. Did you buy something or leave? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I brought my lunch to work the other day and put it in the fridge like I always do. Guess what one of my dumb coworkers did. <endOfText>
<human> Probably ate it or threw it away! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got all my paperwork for grad school ready. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that must be relieving.  College in general can be pretty stressful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just got the lead role in her school play! I can't believe it. She makes me so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome! You guys will remember that forever. Make sure to catch it on video so you can show her when shes all grown up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is learning his ABC's. He can go to C now and count to 3 so I think he will do well learning the rest of it. Im proud of him <endOfText>
<human> That is great!  There is no better feeling than the one you get when your kid makes you proud and happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister ate my food that I wanted all day. <endOfText>
<human> What food was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely for a bit after my girlfriend and I broke up. It was not something I was expecting <endOfText>
<human> Break ups normally have that affect  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Break ups normally have that affect <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I know that now for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thankful when my aunt paid my college debt. It was a great gesture <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is very nice of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Walmart to buy groceries and had to wait 20 minutes in line. <endOfText>
<human> They are always busy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "My dog injured herself on her tongue and had to go in for surgery and my child went to his grandparents house that day so it was weird having the house so quiet. It was almost an eerie feeling. <endOfText>
<human> It is eerie, isn't it. You must have felt quite strange. Hope your poor doggie is ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes she recovered well. Yes it was strange. I was jumping at every sound because I knew I was the only living thing in the house.. or was I? <endOfText>
<human> That must've been terrifying for you. It's amazing how we can hear every little thing around us when we're alone! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very good about a math test. I had studied for it all week. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! You must feel so accomplished! What math class are you taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when my aunt got me a computer for school. It was very nice of her <endOfText>
<human> that is great! family is the best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my dad was going to take care of me when I got the flu. He just wanted me to get better <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of him. He sounds very caring. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I only have one semester left of college and the classes are going to be very difficult. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will get used to them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's dog died <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I am so sorry.  Had she had the dog for a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I missed my friends wedding. I just did not have time to make it <endOfText>
<human> Although you felt bad, I am sure your friend would understand.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Although you felt bad, I am sure your friend would understand. <endOfText>
<human> He did eventually thankfully <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt alone when my dad passed away. I just felt I had no one to turn to <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. Dealing with the loss of a loved one is always difficult but feeling alone in the grief must be so much worse. I hope that you are feeling less alone now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so proud of myself.  I started a new job today! <endOfText>
<human> Oh YAY congrats! You should be proud of yourself, that's a good accomplishment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not understand the number 4 <endOfText>
<human> Sorry, I meant I was excited when I got to go visit a potential college. It was somewhere I wanted to go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I lied to my dad about where I was the night before. I was not sure he would understand <endOfText>
<human> It's something we've all done, dont feel bad. Would he have gotten mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so piss-of at Trump right now <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, what aspect of his presidency is bothering you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a huge test in my Law class today. I won't know how I did until next week. <endOfText>
<human> Did you study hard for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get a good feeling of the past when I hear a certain song. It makes me think of the past which was fun <endOfText>
<human> Mer to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very sad these days.On a deep funk. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, what are you sad about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to get into a school that I wanted. I just worked hard for it to happen <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Congratulations! Are you in college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait till next week.  School starts on Monday. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Are you in school or teaching? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting to hear back on how well I did on my college entrance exams. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I am sure that you did great! Did you just finish high school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when I had to give away my dog. The place I was going to did not allow animals <endOfText>
<human> It's hard to make this decision ... I'm sorry ... What's your pet's name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my grand parents so much. <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you see them anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy these days. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait for the first day of college. I was just ready for it <endOfText>
<human> I remember that feeling myself back on my first day of college <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i finally fully own my car now! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That is exciting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hugged a random woman at the store today... <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was pretty awkward. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel kinda bad.  I took something that didn't belong to me <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what did you take? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a wonderful surprise the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I love surprises.  What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In order try to get a friend to break up with her jerk boyfriend, I sent him fake texts that looked like they were from another woman. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Did it work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma was very sick and unable to get around very easily. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anyone who's there to help her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when I picked up my drunk friend. He was just being a pain <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry to hear; drunk people can make a situation quite difficult to deal with. Have you been friends for long? <endOfText>
<human> We have, I got over it, but at the time it was painful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i found out my dad was cheating on my mom for 3 years. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. Does your mom know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous when I had to go to jury duty. I just did not want to go <endOfText>
<human> I can understand your apprehension. Have you ever served on jury duty before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is the best.I am so proud of her. <endOfText>
<human> What did she accomplish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know... I have never cheated on my husband, or anyone else for that matter. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you.You are a person with morals. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's tough seeing my dog get old and have trouble walking now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh mine too, he is 12 and lost eye sight <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I got picked over for a job, it was a real bummer. <endOfText>
<human> were you qualified ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my sister won a small loterry and she gifted me 500 bucks <endOfText>
<human> That was really lucky! And also very nice of your sister. What'd you do with the case? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was told yesterday while i've been away my pet turtle had died. :( <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Did he at least live a good life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel so bad when I see my other friends with new clothes. I wish I could have clothes that weren't purchased at a thrift store... <endOfText>
<human> I don't think having designer brand is all that great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So when i went to New York for business i had this kid behind me on the plane. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah.. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got a brand new house.. and I feel like a loser because I am still in an apartment. <endOfText>
<human> It is nice to have your own place. Think about just being able to do whatever you want. You can just punch your walls if you want. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbor has this big old dog that keeps pooping huge poops on my driveway <endOfText>
<human> I hate that, did you ask them to stop <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this year. I am so excited for her. <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic! Senior year can be such a fun experience! I hope that she enjoys it. Is she going to take a senior trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So man i had my friend john come back to town. He's looking for a house and last i check he didn't have a job. but apparently he got a job and runs a business now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, he must be proud of himself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i am really mad right now. Brother took my car without asking and i have to go to work. <endOfText>
<human> That would really upset me! How are you going to get to work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get my foot checked out at the doctor recently, always makes me nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will be okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my friend who got better grades then me even if it was me help him study. <endOfText>
<human> That is tough.  Does he help you study too?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so bored sometimes.  Last night I was mega bored... just me and my dog. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try watching movies or playing video games? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want backpacking in the woods last summer. I had a great time but it was strange not seeing any other person for over a week. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes being alone can be a good thing though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to see my favorite band last night. They were good <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is pretty neat. Who is your favorite band anyway? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was alone last summer when all of my friends were gone. It just felt like I had no one to hang with <endOfText>
<human> That would be discouraging.  Did you make new friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not at point. <endOfText>
<human> That's no fun. Hopefully you got some stuff done around the house then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the longest day of work in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.. why what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home today and my whole house was clean.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! that is pretty nice to come home too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of my dad. He got to retire earlier than expected <endOfText>
<human> thats so great! i love my dad too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Least year I took my final performance exam for my pilot's license.  I thought it was going to be easy.  I was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I bet that is a very difficult test. I can't believe how many instruments are in a cockpit! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday was last week. I had to work and was bummed when it seemed like no one even knew it was my big day. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate.  Did the people you work with by any chance surprise you?  Please say yes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew I was going to get into a school I wanted to. I was just glad I had a chance <endOfText>
<human> Congrats!  What school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a long week, we are all packed for a weekend camping excursion. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my brother finished school. I was proud of him <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. Was it high school or college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids left for college last summer. I got teary when they got in the car to leave. I was thinking about how quick their childhood had gone by. <endOfText>
<human> I have those kinds of feelings as well. I think memories are a good thing though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when I got to stay at a cabin last weekend. It felt like home <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really nice!  Did you enjoy yourself and relax? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For the last couple years I had a crush on a girl I knew from high school. I saw her recently with her boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> That must have felt sort of defeating.  There is still hope if there isn't a ring on her finger! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out my attic and stumbled upon my old Star Wars action figures! Going through them really brought back some good memories! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that is awesome. I remember when those came out. Everyone wanted to have one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Argh, I'm so angry about yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's not good! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad last summer when my dog ran away. I thought I would never see him again. <endOfText>
<human> Man, that is so sad.  I don't know what I would do if my dog ran away!  Did you ever find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to hire a plumber last week for a leak in my kitchen sink. Everything was great until I saw the bill. Talk about sticker shock! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah those guys sure charge a lot. They know they are needed for emergencies, hah! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend came home with a giant box today. I have no idea what she was planning. <endOfText>
<human> Is it your birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mislead by a worker who wanted to undermine my work. I had a high estime toward his co worker before this. <endOfText>
<human> That's always hard to deal with. What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made sure to study really hard for my CPA exam. I took the exam last week and thought I knew all the answers. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you will do well, sounds attentve <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat of 13 years was the best thing that ever happened to me, he is now gone <endOfText>
<human> How sad ... you must be desolate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I decided to get a divorce. I feel absolutely defeated and distraught because of it. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that. no chance of working it out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No.  What's done is done.  There is nothing I can do.  It's over unfortunately. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving to the store yesterday when some yahoo cut me off. They almost hit my car. <endOfText>
<human> did you give them the finger ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i do  not like dogs since they chased me when i was a kid and bit mre <endOfText>
<human> That must have been really scary. Maybe you like cats instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost hit a deer driving down the highway a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thank goodness you didnt hit it, for youre sake and the deer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a email from a distant relative recently that said they needed surgery but couldn't afford the bill. I was so worried they would die. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, that is terrible.  They don't have insurance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lady backed into my car the other day and proceeds to tell me she doesn't have insurance. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my. That would really tick me off. In my state they will lose their license for that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very surprised at the USA economy. <endOfText>
<human> in a good way or bad way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet the other day and my neighbor returned it. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that is a good neighbor. I hope you return the favor some time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had prepared so hard for his piano recital last week. He had nerves but did so good and everyone clapped when he was done. <endOfText>
<human> Dang. Did she practice a lot leading up to the recital? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my 25th anniversary high school reunion is around the corner. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Do you think you are going to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bowling alley all alone yesterday because my friends ditched me. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks!  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks!  Bowling is definitely a hang out with friends kind of sport <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, none of my friends wanted to go for some reason. I was so sad and alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week at work I kept hearing people laughing when I walked by. I couldn't figure out what they were laughing at. <endOfText>
<human> That's odd. Were they laughing about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what do you mean by 5? <endOfText>
<human> Sorry - my keyboard was malfunctioning! I meant to tell you about the time my dog pooped on my carpet. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My owl ran away yesterday, but my neighbor managed to find it! <endOfText>
<human> what a joy ... as it is called <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog threw up on my $10,000 tuxedo that I purchased with my lottery winnings. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was almost hit head on by a driver that was texting, I hate people like that! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! How did it feel when it happened? Were you mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I mislead a coworker to undermine his work. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Are you guys still friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park to read a book yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so relaxing.  What book did you read? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting a delivery today but the mailman did not come. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. What was supposed to be coming in the mail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my longsword to me this morning after a heated battle with the adjacent neighborhood. <endOfText>
<human> Did he do any damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to a dim sum place after work. Haven't had some in a while <endOfText>
<human> How is the food usually? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a coupon for free coffee. It's not much, but $5 is $5. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of coffee will you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a total trust in our current gouvernment. I think that they handled very well the tax war that Trump has started <endOfText>
<human> I agree with you. I think everything will be fine in the end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad we have cell phones now as my friend accidentally left my apartment with an important document. <endOfText>
<human> What was the document? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> How did you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mortified. I was going to the bank and tried to open the door. I kept pulling and pulling until I realized I was supposed to push. Unfortunately, a bunch of people saw me. <endOfText>
<human> I had a similar experience the other day at the gas station. It's terrible when that stuff happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend never got back to me about our vacation plans <endOfText>
<human> oh. was it cancelled? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just visited just my best friend the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh? Did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had his wisdom teeth pulled today so I'm doing whatever I can for him while he rests up. <endOfText>
<human> Has he been needy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate a box of donuts yesterday when I promised myself I wouldn't cheat on my diet. I am so let down on myself <endOfText>
<human> It happens, sounds like you need to remove all the bad food from your home <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am impressed how Canadian gouvernment stand against Trump new tax policy. <endOfText>
<human> Are they against Trump? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have already ordered all of my books for this semester <endOfText>
<human> How many? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What are the books about? <endOfText>
<human> They are mostly psychology books. Big and boring lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wireless service. <endOfText>
<human> Which wireless service provider do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My computer keeps overheating when I play intense games, it won't stop bugging me. Ugh <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I hate when my games are interrupted for any reason. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am satisfied with my performance in a video games this morning. I am starting to be patient more. <endOfText>
<human> No rage quitting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY favorite restaurant is closing its doors forever. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of place is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so happy that my cousin got a full ride scholarship! She really worked hard for this chance to be successful! <endOfText>
<human> That is great! You must be so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time my best friend comes back in town, we go eat at the old restaurant that we used to work at when we met. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that brings back a lot of great memories! Is the food good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having a sharp pain in my chest lately. Tomorrow, I go to the doctors and I am optimistic it isn't something too serious... <endOfText>
<human> Where on your chest? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY niece visits me often. She is five. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, she can already drive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I got everything I need for my job interview tomorrow. I got my fancy clothes and answers prepared for common questions they usually throw at u. <endOfText>
<human> Like, What are your weaknesses? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just thinking about the Sunday dinners we use to have at my grannys. <endOfText>
<human> Do you not have them anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My decorating skilss are bomb yo <endOfText>
<human> Ddi you take classes or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was Mark Cuban. I would be rich. <endOfText>
<human> You and me both. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughter has started to dress herself in the morning. One less thing I have to do. <endOfText>
<human> That must save you some time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure that my brother will come home from Iraq. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job does he have in the military? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy to be an American. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, do you like Trump? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the Mile 22 movies to come out. It has one of my favorite UFC fighters in it and I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> I saw the trailer, looks good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything is falling into place for me. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that is a great feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the good days of Halo 3. It was one of the best moments of my life as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I couldn't get into that game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait for the new Mission Impossible movie. <endOfText>
<human> Me either I love adventure movies! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to get a full ride scholarship. I'm attending an ivy league school. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is impressive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice to know there are faithful people still out there. Keep it up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend and I have lived 5 minutes or less away from each other for the past 20 years. <endOfText>
<human> You must see them a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the fall. <endOfText>
<human> I love the fall. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just invested in a case of heineken for tonigh. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, whats the reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its Friday. I feel bad though because I have to get up in the morning and do school stuff. <endOfText>
<human> Will you not go out then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I went to take the trash out and I almost died. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A truck almost ran me off the road the other day, thank god the median was there. I never understood the expression life flashing before my eyes, but after that, I did. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I would have freaked out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a hissing noise outside my door and I swear to god it was a snake. It turned out to my brother playing a prank on me. <endOfText>
<human> I would be so mad. I am terrified of snakes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the next McGregor fight <endOfText>
<human> I just read about that today.  Do you think he will be ready for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe that I got a call from an old friend <endOfText>
<human> What did they call about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very reluctant to confront my boss on her behaviors recently. She is picking on all the male employees for no reason.. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is growing so fast. <endOfText>
<human> Are you the mother or father? Time flies so fast.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh I can't believe what happened, he doesn't deserve this. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I promised my friend to pick her up after work but I totally forgot. I just left her at work and now I feel like I let her down immensely. <endOfText>
<human> She was probably disappointed at you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the middle of the night I heard some weird noises coming from my basement. I grabbed my flashlight and baseball bat and tip-toed down there. <endOfText>
<human> Should have grabbed the gun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got 2 working arms and legs. I am so thankful for that. <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear. Disabilities are never easy for people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a little conflicted and disloyal today. I told my boss I applied for a new job. He was sad. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe he should give you a raise so you can stay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I think he'd like to, but I just need to move on. I feel bad because he's been good to me though. <endOfText>
<human> Well you have to think about yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to rush home from school to catsh a soap opera <endOfText>
<human> Really? Which one was it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really? Which one was it? <endOfText>
<human> Passions <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was that in the United States or somewhere else? I used to love All My Children and General Hospital. <endOfText>
<human> It was in the US it had a bunch of young people on it. We would all talk about it at school the next day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds like fun! I wonder if you could find old episodes online now. <endOfText>
<human> Probably. A lot of the actors have gone on to be in big movies <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter lost her last baby tooth today, she's growing up and it gets me a little choked up. <endOfText>
<human> I was just talking about this with my friend. They are getting too old <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked to the store the other all cool and breezy. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have plans to pick up something special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am satisfied with my gains so far. I hit the gym only 2 times a week but I am ok with that. <endOfText>
<human> Are you making some good progress? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Times sure have changed. When I was a kid no one locked their doors or had to get weapons for self-protection. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, the crime rate has steadily been rising. Not good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker got a promotion that I was pushing for her to get. I am so happy for her! She really does deserve it. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. I bet she worked really hard to get that promotion. Good for her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I think back to the early 2000's, it was such a great time for me personally. Everything was perfect. <endOfText>
<human> It feels nostalgic, what did you like most about that time period? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever been to a haunted house? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I didn't like it at all. I'm not into jump scares. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to have the best next door neighbors. <endOfText>
<human> Was there any reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister and I got into this huge fight and she called me a fat cow. <endOfText>
<human> I call my sister that all the time.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> To be funny or what? Because I think it's really rude and unforgiveable. <endOfText>
<human> OH. I'm sorry. We do that to each other. I  didn't know she hurt your feelings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I call my sister that all the time. <endOfText>
<human> To be funny or what? Because I think it's really rude and unforgiveable.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a game off of the internet and it came in on a way later date than expected. <endOfText>
<human> Thats Sucks I download games so I don't have that problem <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a little scared to move to a new neighborhood <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well as long as they're good people than it shouldn't be that bad. <endOfText>
<human> I hope they are nice. I want to feel cofortable <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is the worst. <endOfText>
<human> What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad that the summer is almost over. <endOfText>
<human> IT went by fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had eggs for breakfast this morning. I don't think I cooked the eggs enough and the yolk was raw, I felt like vomiting. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's the worst to spend time cooking something and then taking a bite and it's awful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to get to the ocean! It's been a long time coming for me! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Are you going scuba divng? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I helped an old lady with her groceries the other day. Made me feel good. <endOfText>
<human> What did you carry for her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I didn't tell her about the vase. <endOfText>
<human> What ahappened to the vase? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not in the best financial situation right now. Hear me out, these ramen noodles will turn into filet mignon steaks one day! <endOfText>
<human> Hey. It happened to me. It could happen to you too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a box of honey buns yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> You know, thinking about it. I don't think I've ever had a honey bun... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new neighbors are already on my list. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of list is that? Are you bringing them some Christmas cookies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spotted my dream car the other day. It is a Honda Civic Type R. <endOfText>
<human> Ok. That's kinda neat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love looking at my kids pictures. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's sweet! How old are your kids?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww that's sweet! How old are your kids? <endOfText>
<human> 4 and 5 and 14. I put up a ulletin board in my office and filled it with their pics. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I had a really scary experience where I was walking home by myself in a city where I was studying abroad, and a man started following me and verbally harassing me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I would have screamed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I called a friend on my phone and talked to her. Thankfully I coincidentally ran into some other students that I knew and they walked with me the rest of the way. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. No police were involved? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a great night the other evening. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never go on a diet like I say <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. What's holding you back?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that. What's holding you back? <endOfText>
<human> I just never do it. I want to wear a two peice bikini one summer lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just keep working at it. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks for the support stranger lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The last season of game of thrones is soon. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, the last one? How many seasons have they made? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my exam yesterday. It was so tempting because the girl next to me didn't even bother covering her answers. <endOfText>
<human> did you get an A? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm perfectly fine with being single at the moment. It gives me a lot of clarity and time to self-reflect. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. I can focus on myself for a while <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't a very good girlfriend to my ex. <endOfText>
<human> At least you are thinking back on it and doing some self-reflecting.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At least you are thinking back on it and doing some self-reflecting. <endOfText>
<human> I used to pretend to be asleep when he got off work just so he wouldnt talk to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some car trouble the other day. My car wouldn't start and I didn't know why. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very pleased with the work Trump has done. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I really liked those hunting trophies he got. We should be allowed to kill any animals we see! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had escargot? <endOfText>
<human> No, that's a little too expensive for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never been more appalled in my life, my husband stole money out of MY bank account and then tried to cover it up! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. What was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been reluctant to confront my mother on her stealing my money. I know what she's doing is wrong but she is mother after all. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I have no advice there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going shopping tomorrow! yay <endOfText>
<human> What are you planning on buying?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ACtually Im going with my mom. She always buys whatever I want <endOfText>
<human> You self-entitled brat! Just kidding, your mother loves you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What are you planning on buying? <endOfText>
<human> ACtually Im going with my mom. She always buys whatever I want  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the winter storms. <endOfText>
<human> Storms? Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous for next weekend. <endOfText>
<human> What is this weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stop thinking about when Christmas will be here. I love how New Years comes right after that. <endOfText>
<human> I am waiting for Halloween. Its my favorite. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love when my mom invites me places <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. You guys sound very close! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very amazed about how great the circus was. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? I heard the circus had to close recently. What is your favorite part? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I got my car washed. I was pulling out of the car wash and a bird nailed my hood with its mess. <endOfText>
<human> Did you clean it again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I got accepted to school <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss being a kid <endOfText>
<human> What do you miss most about being a kid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> How old will you be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked the Red Sox beat the Yankees today. <endOfText>
<human> They did? I've never seen a baseball game lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pleased that I got to meet Donald Trump. <endOfText>
<human> I don't believe you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until tomorrow. It's going to be lit!! <endOfText>
<human> What will be lit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was 26 when I had my first child - that was a very scary experience.  I'm actually surprised we went on and had another one! <endOfText>
<human> That is scary! As a 26 year old I cannot imagine actually having kids at this age. I'd be running around like a chicken <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car broke down on the side of the road in the country <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did you have a cell phone or did anyone come out to help you?  I literally hate car problems. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought a new mobile. <endOfText>
<human> What kind did they get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter went shopping for her school clothes without me for the first time <endOfText>
<human> It's sad actually. But be happy she become independent. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband really did a number on me when he proposed to me - I was completely not expecting it! <endOfText>
<human> That's crazy! I hope to propose one day. Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently, a person cut in front of me in line at the grocery store. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, that is so annoying. Did you say anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat constantly jumps on my keyboard even though I put him on the other side of the room <endOfText>
<human> Did you try taken him to a specialist to help with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today, it is rainning because of that I can't get out. It is boring. <endOfText>
<human> Rainy days are boring, but I do like the sound of them. It's calming in a way <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what? <endOfText>
<human> Who? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it was terrifying indeed!  We were swimming just fine when all of a sudden a big wave sucked us under and spit us out into a deep section. We were seperated and out of breathe.  I surely thought this was the end for both of us. <endOfText>
<human> Glad you are both safe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day I was behind a guy on a two lane road that was going 10 miles under the speed limit. We approached a light that turned yellow. He floored it and I got stuck at the red light. So mad. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least you followed the law and didn't end up running a red light. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you watch POWER? <endOfText>
<human> no , but i heard about it in commercials  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no , but i heard about it in commercials <endOfText>
<human> I didn't think it was going to be as good as it is. You should check it out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i will try on do this asap , dude yesterday i forgot to pay some money i owed my friend, i felt kinda of ashamed <endOfText>
<human> tell me about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i did not feel good at all of what had happened <endOfText>
<human> Well, maybe your friend will understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is finnaly fully potty trained! <endOfText>
<human> That is a great accomplishment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving in a parking lot and someone stole my parking spot. <endOfText>
<human> That makes me mad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moced out of the city. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you move to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous.  I have a blind date coming up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh. That's kind of exciting though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cooked a relly nice breakfast this morning <endOfText>
<human> Hey great! What did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our family has been really sad. We recently lost our 23 year old niece. <endOfText>
<human> Thats terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have heard of that. <endOfText>
<human> It is like and infection in the brain.  It came on pretty sudden though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids are still sleep at noon on a Saturday! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I remember those days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Wendy's and the cashier overcharged me. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is so energetic. I miss when he was a little baby. <endOfText>
<human> Why is he 2 now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yeah, its Saturday night and I am just sitting here chillin... <endOfText>
<human> By yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a nice breakfast for me and my kids today. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds nice.  What did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty thankful to have family living close <endOfText>
<human> I wish my family lived close. You are lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This city has become so boring <endOfText>
<human> How so? Just used to the way things are? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife got a promotion yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous about tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you so nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son recently graduated from high school. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. What is he doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just sitting here going through old photo albums.. looking at family photos.  A bit sad.. but fun.. <endOfText>
<human> I do that a lot.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do that a lot. <endOfText>
<human> I kind of miss having photo albums.. the internet sure has changed how we do things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I look forward to our family reunion every year. <endOfText>
<human> thats cool that you have one every year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My company will give us a bonus because the quarter was good. I am happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I've never gotten a bonuse at work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have worked so hard in school lately. <endOfText>
<human> Are you tired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my taxes last year. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get caught? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out and stocked up on storm supplies yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is there a storm approaching? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think all of my friends are just around for my money. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure they're not - what makes you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I passed all of my classes last semester. That's a first. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! That is great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son always used to be a really good student. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im a little nervous.. I just finished my online class and the grades are still not up yet. <endOfText>
<human> That can be nerve wrecking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm leaving for college soon. I have never been so far from home alone. <endOfText>
<human> How far are you going?  What school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The test was so hard, but I think I got a good grade! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you get a good grade. Were you well prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of friend didn't come to my birthday party. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's so sad, I hope you had fun though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty happy to find out I was having a girl <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool!  How pregnant are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad.. My husband wont stop playing his video game. <endOfText>
<human> That would be annoying.  How about meeting up with a friend or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to not like dramas because they were too emotional <endOfText>
<human> I like being emotional <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel horrible. I did something bad. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put an empty envelope in the collection basket at church. <endOfText>
<human> Lol. I've done that before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to visit my family for four weeks. Now that I am back home, I feel lonely. <endOfText>
<human> I would imagine so.  It is difficult to be away from family for long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  am pretty certain I will be able to afford a vacation for my family <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome.  Where are you wanting to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yeah.. I am taking care of my mom now. <endOfText>
<human> That can be stressful. Is she ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won 20$ off a lottery ticket this morning. Didn't expect it to be honest! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that rocks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love spending time and helping out my grandma <endOfText>
<human> That's kind of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt had just lost her husband and was very upset. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sucks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very ready for my exam tomorrow. I stayed up all night studying. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hated being tagged in photos from the weekend <endOfText>
<human> Lol. Are you embarrased? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I saw this guys drop twenty dollars in the store when he got his phone out of his pocket. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got 2 working arms and legs. I am so thankful for that. <endOfText>
<human> That is something to be grateful for. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids are a real blessing <endOfText>
<human> How old are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am perfectly satisfied with having no car. Everything I need is within walking distance. <endOfText>
<human> I am very content with having no car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to only eat microwaveable food. <endOfText>
<human> That can be very unhealthy for you but it's so convenient <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to feed my pets this morning. I feel terrible about it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! <endOfText>
<human> Yes, they are all angry at me and I feel so guilty <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so envious of rich people <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I like to see them as inspiration <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am optimistic about the results about my exam test. I think I did well! <endOfText>
<human> What is the class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A really young guy hooked up my cable yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Are you a guy too? I bet you were envious of his looks and age hahah <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going on roller coasters makes me so nervous. I can't stand the feeling in my chest on the comedown. <endOfText>
<human> I hate them too. I havent been on one in ten years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost all my money in my bank account due to fraud. I am so broken... <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Won't the bank help you out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter told me last night she wanted a guitar <endOfText>
<human> Are guitars expensive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The best shows come on in the fall <endOfText>
<human> What shows are you referring to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my money in my bank got stolen due to fraud and I am so mad... <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Will you be able to get it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my ex boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> how long were u together <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ust got my first apartment and I love it <endOfText>
<human> Nice, is it expensive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my daughter go out with her friends today. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of you, do you usually let her go out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out yesterday with a shirt that had a huge hole in the back. I didn't notice until a stranger pointed it out and I was so humiliated. <endOfText>
<human> Lol. That sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of the classes I wanted to take are full <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that sucks. Did you find another class that is open? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure I will do well on my test tomorrow. Wish me luck. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck. What is the class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so excited to see my kids when they came home <endOfText>
<human> Aww. That's nice. Did you dosomething special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am reluctant to confront my my best friend's girlfriend. I think my best friend is cheating on her... <endOfText>
<human> You should definitely first talk to your friend and clear out the concerns with him before talking to his partner <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I became on of THOSE people <endOfText>
<human> Im almost afraid to ask <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the good ol' days of when I didn't have any responsibilities and I was a kid! <endOfText>
<human> I know right. I was just talking about that with my friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my phone outside all night last night <endOfText>
<human> I hope it didn't rain <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for date night <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome!  What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am praying that I get the part <endOfText>
<human> What part is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like blowing a trumpet I am so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Yay! What made you very happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My naeighbors are really getting on my nerves. <endOfText>
<human> That is no good.  What are they doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy that I found all these old pictures <endOfText>
<human> What are they pictures of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very sad about someone last night when they chose to ruin all the trust built up over something stupid. <endOfText>
<human> THat sounds bad.  Are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a smothering parent. It's terrible <endOfText>
<human> Are you a helicopter parent?  Do you spin? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sooo mad.  I came home and someone burnt a pizza in my oven and left it there. <endOfText>
<human> OH. That's terrible.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> OH. That's terrible. <endOfText>
<human> I know and it was one of those expensive frozen pizzas too... Made my blood boil. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very compassionate towards someone I know with a mental illness and how they need a permanent place for a home. <endOfText>
<human> Did you give them a home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get a break from the kids soon. <endOfText>
<human> Would you like me to take them? :) I like kids, sometimes! I totally understand needing a break <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently bought a lotto ticket and won $50! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome.  I love gambling.  Was it a scratch off?  Pick 3? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sooo I just got done packing and I am ready for my trip... <endOfText>
<human> Cool, where are you heading to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited to go to the park with the kids today <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! What kind of park is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in despair that someone ruined everything over nothing. They continue to ruin their life and everyone's around them. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible.  What can you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super grossed out when I left some noodles in the sink last night and today there were maggots. I about vomited. Fly summer :/ trying everything! <endOfText>
<human> I had to buy a fruit fly trap this summer as well.  But as soon as I set it up they stopped flying around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have sticky traps and keep things cleaned with bleach and lemon. I need to put lime in the yard and see if that helps. It's like they get in ANY crack everyday! So gross! <endOfText>
<human> I feel your pain.. I really do! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so nervous taking my dog to the vet today... <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord, I hate the vets! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoy sitting outside on a nice cool day, watching my kids play in the yard. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great.  What do they like to do in the yard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to get on the road <endOfText>
<human> Going for a road trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Facebook showed me the old pic from 9 years ago! Hard to believe so much time passed. It made me a bit sad in remembering my cats who have passed. it was a pic of my cat. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, how cute. Do you miss playing with your cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Welp.. I am a little nervous about going back to school this year. <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to school for? Online or in person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super sad yesterday when someone I know ruined the little bit of trust I had in them. <endOfText>
<human> What did that do..  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did that do.. <endOfText>
<human> I allowed them back in too rebuild..and they ruined it again. So I really don't know if I'll ever let them back in again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really upset when I heard my best friend lied to me <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel. I hate lairs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super frustrated that someone I know keeps ruining their life. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate.  Especially when there's nothing you can do to stop it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my keys at a bar last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! Are they car keys as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep.  and it gets worse.   Apparently sometimes people will steal keys,  then come back and steal your car after you leave, according to the bar tenders.  So I got my truck towed home.  And... no house keys.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! Well please get ALL your locks changed. The car will be more difficult however hopefully they have no idea where you live so you should be ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very anxious this weekend as someone I was trying to fix a relationship with is acting up again. <endOfText>
<human> That is very difficult. I wish you will find a solution. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting my exams results. I wish I will have good grade. <endOfText>
<human> What are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to be off work <endOfText>
<human> Tell me about it! I think about getting off as soon as I walk in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine spent all night partying instead of staying home to study. He ended up failing an important exam! <endOfText>
<human> That is no good.  I bet he regrets it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new foster dog finally run around last night. She has been very abused and starved but is so young. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that is so sad to hear. I'm glad that she has a good home now, though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really thinking about switching jobs, but I'm not sure if I should. <endOfText>
<human> What are the pros of switching jobs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night my new dog finally played! She was so starved and abused but she is so young! <endOfText>
<human> I also have a dog that was starved when she was young! She is so afraid of everything even to this day, but she's almost 8! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We recently got 9 chicks and we've been having to work on making them a coop! I had to do so much research but I think we finally have a place that they'll enjoy living when they aren't able to free range. <endOfText>
<human> OHH! I Love chickens ! I have always wanted some. I have a duck! lol- What kind of chickens are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well someone I am thinking of working things out with talked about coming over on Sunday. I felt really uncomfortable with that because they haven't done enough to build back enough trust with me yet. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should be straight with him?  That’s the only thing that will make it good in my opinion.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always am but I just have to word things in a good way..however lo and behold..they acted up and made the decision for me anyway. <endOfText>
<human> I know the type.  There are better people out there that you just have to be patient for.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe you should be straight with him?  That’s the only thing that will make it good in my opinion. <endOfText>
<human> I always am but I just have to word things in a good way..however lo and behold..they acted up and made the decision for me anyway.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  am so glad I get to see my cousins this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Were you all best friends as children? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been going to the gym for the last 3-4 years and haven't missed a single workout. <endOfText>
<human> Now that's dedication! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a gift card I forgot I had in a drawer! <endOfText>
<human> I love that when that happens! What is it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its for a restaraunt here in town.  So i've got a couple of free meals <endOfText>
<human> Love that! Glad you found it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very happy last night when my new dog was running around playing, I didn't think she knew how. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, dogs have to learn how to play.  Kinda funny you don't always consider that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hello how has your day been going <endOfText>
<human> I'm great how are you doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy that my daughter is doing so much better in school <endOfText>
<human> thats great to hear , getting along better with the other students ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A found a box of my old toys from when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was fun to look through <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting my exams results. I am sure that I passed the exams. <endOfText>
<human> i hope that you did well on them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am angry with how my neighbors talk to their dogs. <endOfText>
<human> I can't stand people who treat animals horribly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super OVER the people who litter on the outside of my lawn everyday. <endOfText>
<human> I understand. Did you catch some of them in action? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the time when I was young and I can do a lot of sport. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! How old are you? As we get older, all kinds of stuff doesn't work the same <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe how much work my boss is able to do every day without getting tired out or slowing down! <endOfText>
<human> Some people have incredible energy and drive!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some people have incredible energy and drive! <endOfText>
<human> It's amazing to watch! It's one of the few occasions where you can just watch a person and understand WHY they have the position they're in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was totally grossed out by a guy who threw his nasty cup of something out the window on the EXPRESSWAY. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, I HATE when people do that! That stuff can land on someone's windshield! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really hurt when my boyfriend moved away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! Why did he move away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a neighbor who sits outside all day and it's across from my backyard so I can't sit and relax and watch the birds. <endOfText>
<human> How come you can sit also? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to babysit for my nephews <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Babysitting kids is sometime nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have knee problems and a coworker don't stop making jokes the way I am walking. He making very angry each time. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible.  How do they get away with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today has been uneventful but, I got a lot of errands done. <endOfText>
<human> That is always good! Errands can be a pain! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom lost some of her teeth in a car accident and full coverage car insurance NEVER covers them. <endOfText>
<human> I guess I never  thought about weather or not car insurance covers your own injuries too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really happy last night when my abused dog started running around and playing! <endOfText>
<human> That is great, what was wrong with the dog, how was it abused  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great, what was wrong with the dog, how was it abused <endOfText>
<human> She was starved and I don't know what else besides being bred and being quite young. So starved she was quite aggressive about food at first and so tired..I could see her hip bones. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty shaken up from the scary movie <endOfText>
<human> Me also when I was young. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting some help from a coworker but he didn't keep his word. Before, I held him in high esteem. Not anymore. <endOfText>
<human> That is disappointing. I am sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sad some people I like are such bully's to others. It's a real big turn off. <endOfText>
<human> I hate bullies, but they usually get what's coming to them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend fell on hard times, so I let him borrow my brand new car so he can get to work. <endOfText>
<human> That is incredibly kind of you, I hope he is a good driver :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other week it sounded like a bomb went off. I am in a very dangerous city, so you never know here. Between the gunshots and fireworks..AND fire balls..it's hard to tell! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I'd be afraid to go outside! I hope you are able to stay safe! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish there will be more opportunities at work to make more money <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! Have you thought about starting a side business? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super proud of my little dog. She is sharing her space with a big gal dog who was really abused. <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice of him to welcome that poor dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got payed yesterday , so i finally bought new clothes and went out to eat with some friends <endOfText>
<human> Payday is fantastic! What kind of clothes did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very irritated with people who want to make everyone else miserable when they are. <endOfText>
<human> i freakin  hate that, like dude be sad or mad on your own dont take it out on your family, friends , or co workers  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i freakin  hate that, like dude be sad or mad on your own dont take it out on your family, friends , or co workers <endOfText>
<human> WHOA! That's EXACTLY what I say- if you want to be miserable fine..but I don't want to be, so don't take me down with you! Do it to yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will never give up on my family <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear! Are there any issues? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very apprehensive about someone coming to my house this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> How come you were worried about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> love getting together with my brother and reminiscing about when we were younger <endOfText>
<human> Things were much simpler when we were kids. You are your brother must have a close relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really needed to fart and so I let one out down a grocery isle while shopping thinking I was alone, but I wasn't! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Was anyone around? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating at the Mcdonalds when someone who smell very bad sat behind me. The smell was so bad that I was going to throw up. <endOfText>
<human> That's disgusting. Did you move to another table? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt died. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. How are you feeling now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pretty crappy at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> I understand. It is tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty excited to have a night out with the girls <endOfText>
<human> How long has it been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty lonely last night as it was Friday <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry that you had to go through that.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry that you had to go through that. <endOfText>
<human> Oh we all have I am sure :) Thanks. but then the person who is trying to build trust with me acted like a (fill in the blank) and I wasn't so lonely anymore. I remembered why I prefer being alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found $100 in an old pair of pants. <endOfText>
<human> OH! That is the best isn't it? What will you do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hopeful that good things come to those who wait. <endOfText>
<human> What good thing are you waiting for, exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have messed up a lot with relationships in my life..picking the wrong people so I am happier to wait until it is right and I can trust someone. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you'll find someone.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I logged in too facebook, I do not very often and felt a bit sad that I don't talk to anyone anymore. <endOfText>
<human> It is good to maintain that contact with people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy to relax on this fine day <endOfText>

<human> Did you tell his parents? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we have been getting in a lot of christmas freight over the last couple of months at my store, it always brings back a lot of memories of the good old times <endOfText>
<human> I know, Christmas was the best when we were children. Now that were adults it's not as exciting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  am so excited to spend each day with the kids during the summer <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Are you planning activities to do with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend will be going to school in another country for 4 years <endOfText>
<human> which country? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a laptop on sale but by the time I got to the store after work, it was sold out. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I have recently started gardening, but am not very good. Thankfully, my dad came over and helped me out! He saved ma a lot of time and effort! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I wish more people would garden, so much healthier to grow your own food. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently lost some weight and now when I dress up I feel more confident. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! You must be feeling more alive and well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad! My insurance company keeps denying a valid claim and it causes the Doctor to send me a bill! I keep having to call and do their job for them! <endOfText>
<human> Insurance companies suck.  I hate dealing with them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I inherited my grandfather's rifle. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome!  I would love to get something like that from a relative!  Does it have any sentimental value? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so proud of my son who just finished 6th grade. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! 6th grade, that's amazing. Are you planning on celebrating? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Fun! He must be really passionate about learning <endOfText>
<human> Yes he really does enjoy. He's always telling me about stuff he's learned. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm almost ready to put my Venison wellington in the oven. I think its going to come out great.". <endOfText>
<human> What's wellington? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad just bought a new motorcycle for my sister since her old one isn't safe anymore! Why can't I get a free motorcycle?! <endOfText>
<human> Anymore? Are they ever safe?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was excited that my neighbor came to my door <endOfText>
<human> Good, How long haven't you talk to each other? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able sort out some communication problems that I had with my manager. I can finaly enjoy my job with peaceful mind. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that feels good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoy looking after defenseless animals. All of our cats are rescues! <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like you have a lot of animals! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am volunteering to be a class mom this year. <endOfText>
<human> That is very considerate of you. What are your duties as class mom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat threw up a hairball on bed yesterday. I was so peeved! <endOfText>
<human> Those are so gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saved up money for four years to buy my motorcycle. <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool.  You got it then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to visit my aunt <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet! How long has it been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my childhood friends. We were so close and always playing together. <endOfText>
<human> I miss mine too. Where did you guys grow up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow I have an interview for a new job. Never been so prepared in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. Good luck with that. You are interviewing for which position? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to play hours of video games last night after a tough week at work. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds relaxing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can finally say my son is sel sufficient <endOfText>
<human> It is a great feeling when we can say that. My 37th child just became self-sufficient last year as well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My food order today did not turn out as well as I had hoped. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear!  What all did you order?  And what was wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought so many groceries today. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. What did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went hiking all by my lonesome yesterday because my friends blew me off. <endOfText>
<human> Are you mad at them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I preordered a New Tesla 3 last fall and have still yet to be contacted about when we will get it. Tesla is such a let down for us right now! <endOfText>
<human> wow. was it expensive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to a party this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Awesome!  Are you excited to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma didn't make my oatmeal right yesterday. I was so mad that I poured the chunky, boiling contents of the bowl all over her wrinkly head. That'll teach her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!  You were pretty angry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a good moment yesterday...my son spoke his first word! <endOfText>
<human> Oh. wow. Did you cry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new job is so great. <endOfText>
<human> What is your new job like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a physics test tomorrow. I think I can say that after 10 days of nonstop studying and copious amounts of adderall, I am finally ready. <endOfText>
<human> Physics? That must be crazy hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the garbage to the road last night and the bag burst. Got nasty stuff all over my shirt. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, that's the worst!  Bright side - at least you weren't far from home that you were able to clean everything up, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I swore off fast food this month. <endOfText>
<human> Good job!  How are you doing so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister and I watch each other's children while we work <endOfText>
<human> That's nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker won the lottery. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! They are pretty lucky! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son moved out on his own last year. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, a bird left the nest.  How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is finally using the potty. <endOfText>
<human> That wonderful!  Did he initiate it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so grossed out to see my ex <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my sister were so close growing up. <endOfText>
<human> Are you still close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to be having my baby next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Congrats?  Boy or girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So thankful for good friends <endOfText>
<human> It's always nice to have some good friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a annoying day at work last week. <endOfText>
<human> I've been there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to this new restaurant and it wasa amazing <endOfText>
<human> What kind of restaurant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Me two. No bills and just relax and play. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being stressed never helps. <endOfText>
<human> Being broke never helps <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I embarassed myself in front my class in high school once. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Winter come so quickly. So I need to be well prepared in advance. <endOfText>
<human> We have cold winters but hardly ever any snow. I'm glad too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A guy cut us off in the car today and almost made us get in a car accident. <endOfText>
<human> Did you follow him home and confront him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my daughter go shopping for school clothes with her friends today <endOfText>
<human> How'd she do?  Did she get the right clothes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I did something terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what was it?  Not too bad I hope. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the best time this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to ace all of my classes this semester. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  I know that took a lot of hard work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt a little bad I accidentally bought 5 packages of clearance cookies. I thought they were gluten free but I got the wrong kind. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to eat them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex and I broke up but it was nice and clean. <endOfText>
<human> That is great when that can happen but it doesn't always if one or both love a lot! I hope you remain friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My refrigerator broke today. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible.  Did you lose all the food that was in there or were you able to save it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is pregnant with our first child. I can't wait to see this baby for the first time! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Congratulatios <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> HUGS! I saw a mom and baby bunny around 8 and they were letting me talk to them. It was a bit shocking as usually bunnies take off whenever they see or hear anything. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how adorable! There are so many bunnies around right now.  My parents house has especially a lot of them and they don't really run off like normal either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to have grandkids. IS that weird? <endOfText>
<human> Not to me!  Some part of me is anxious to be holding a grandchild, and then when they poop or get fussy, to hand them riiiiiiight back to their parents! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when I saw two bunnies..a mom I assume and her baby, running around tonight. <endOfText>
<human> A.ww that must have been so cute <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im not sure my boyfriend is the one <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is a hard thing to think about. You might want to take some time apart and find it out to be fair to him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids are gone for the weekend. My house has never been so quiet <endOfText>
<human> Is that a good or a bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super aggravated at people that just can't let things be peaceful. Even if you disagree. <endOfText>
<human> That makes me mad too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughter left our freezer open for hours today. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! Was everything ruined? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh how disappointing. <endOfText>
<human> I know <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are out of town on vacation with my parents for the next week. <endOfText>
<human> That must feel awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the DMV today to renew my license. It took 4 hours and I ended up having to use a sick day...Not happy! <endOfText>
<human> I swear, the DMV is the *worst*! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my ex <endOfText>
<human> That's understandable. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super sad that people I've known and cared for do not want to change their destructive behaviors. I <endOfText>
<human> that sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker ripped a nasty ole fart in her cubicle the other day. Which just so happened to be next to mine. <endOfText>
<human> Lol. That's gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my phone today. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good. How did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got out of the slammer last month after being there for 50 years. Hoping the remainder of my life is spent on a beach like at the end of Shawshank Redemption. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow.  That's a long time.  How old were you when you first went in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "Last week, my husband surprised me with a trip to Charleston, South Carolina next month. I am so excited! We haven't had a vacation in years so I can't even believe it!" <endOfText>
<human> South Carolina is really nice. What are you planning on doing there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Eat at as many restaurants as I can, go to Folley Beach, explore plantations, and take a carriage ride to name a few. I have been researching a lot. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a grand ole time. Everyone likes the good ole carriage ride every now and again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a new job last week. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get a call back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost another wallet today <endOfText>
<human> Oh darn that is stressful I bet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy I am not being abused today. <endOfText>
<human> I happy you're not being abused either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always have to save up to buy myself something nice. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you :) I do the same <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends wouldn't go with me to the gym last night. I was so mad that I shattered my phone. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, sounds like you really like working out with your friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was married to my wife for thirty years, and even though she has passed I can't bring myself to date anyone else. <endOfText>
<human> After being married for that long, I really don't blame you. Do you want to move on and find someone else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter stayed home while I ran errands today <endOfText>
<human> Did she get into any trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Surprisingly she had cleaned the house. <endOfText>
<human> Well that was very nice of her. Did you give her anything in return? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my grandma to the ER yesterday because she broke a nail. <endOfText>
<human> Did she get a cute bandaid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss old times when my grandma was with us. <endOfText>
<human> I hear ya there.  When did you lose her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love that I have friendly neighbors that like to sit outside and have a bee on the weekends <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice to friendly neighboors. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I just found out that I'm pregnant. Its exciting but also scary because I lost my last baby at 18 weeks along. I'm just really trying to have faith that it'll turn out well." <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  I'm sure everything is going to turn out well.  You probably have to see your doctor more than usual to make sure everything is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, they told me that I would see a specialist along with my regular OBGYN and they seem to be staying on top of things.  I am now also eating a plant based diet and feeling much better than my other pregnancy. <endOfText>
<human> That's definitely a good sign! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex flaked on me again today. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Why did he/she do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a wee lad, I was always afraid of going to sleep. Always thought there was a big ole scary monster lurking in the closet. <endOfText>
<human> I used to think that too. I could sleep if it wasn't closed all the way <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was robbed at gunpoint once when i worked as a cashier. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!  Did the guy get caught? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes he did and I had to testify against him. It was very scary. <endOfText>
<human> That would be.  I am so sorry you had to go through that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love that my kids have started helping out around the house now <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like you have some good help now. How old are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My big soccer game is tomorrow. I am so excited that I can't even sleep <endOfText>
<human> What position do you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't ask the girl I like to the Prom and I really wish I had just gone for it. <endOfText>
<human> What was holding you back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a random bonus in my last paycheck I received this week. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome.  Did you find out what it was for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy to snuggle in my boyfriends arms and watch tv all day tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a jolly good time, ole chap. What shows/movies are you planning on watching? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter and I found a sweet little bird that was hurt yesterday, sitting outside our door. We are trying to give it water and help it heal. Its so pitiful and helpless. <endOfText>
<human> Awwwww!  You guys are doing the right thing.  How is it doing today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned for a great vacation, then someone at work got sick so I couldn't go. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. Did you already made reservation and purchase airline tickets? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily I was driving, and was able to cancel my hotel reservations. <endOfText>
<human> Good. There was no else that could replace the person sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to find that at work my coworker prepared a birthday party for me. I was not expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you get a lot of presents?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow. I bet that was a nice surprise. Did you get a lot of presents? <endOfText>
<human> Yes. The most that we could garther together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took out the trash last night and had the displeasure of seeing a herd of cockroaches at the bottom of the bin. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that is disgusting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe my friend started working with me <endOfText>
<human> Where do you guys work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mad last week when I got a flat. It was in traffic too <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer. Did you get it repaired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter said her first word yesterday. I was so proud! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I bet that made you smile <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait to go to the amusement park. I had no been in awhile. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun. Did you ride a lot of rides? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughters all made the A honor roll at school. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was. They work very hard to make their goals. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure they learned from you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am lucky to have a roof over my head <endOfText>
<human> I am as well. Even if it is a simple thatched roof. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to the park alone yesterday. Feels bad, man. <endOfText>
<human> How come it felt bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy to be working and making money.". <endOfText>
<human> Yes, thats always a good thing. Have you been working long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Mother was ill. I was very worried about her condition. <endOfText>
<human> That is no good. How is she doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She is better now, but when she was sick I never left her side and made sure she was well taken care of. <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to close a bank account today, and when they got there they said it was overdrawn by an IRS tax lien. I have never been so angry in my life! <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible!  I would've been too.  That actually happened to me but thankfully it was an old account that I didn't use.  Did they take money from you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son goes to kindergarten in a week and I can't imagine him being gone through the day. It's hard to not be worried about how he'll be at school. <endOfText>
<human> He'll have a great time, though.  He'll make tons of friends and his days will be full of joy!  You will need some hobbies though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Friends threw me a surprise party at work yesterday. It was quite the surprise! <endOfText>
<human> Did you have fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to see my aunt at Christmas. I had not seen her in a long time <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Are you and your aunt close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The cashier at the grocery store gave me back the wrong amount of change. i didn't notice until I was at home. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I called the store and spoke with the manager. <endOfText>
<human> what did they advise you to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my driver's license test tomorrow. Been practicing all week for it. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome.  Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very happy to have the whole family at my house for Easter <endOfText>
<human> That's really neat. Did you guys have an easter egg hunt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very envious when my brother got this cd before I did. It was from my favorite band <endOfText>
<human> I understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was waiting in a long line to take the bus. Two young women cut the line and go directly in front everybody. <endOfText>
<human> You need to speak up next time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure I will get this house clean tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> goodluck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad left for his deployment to Afghanistan yesterday. It was a sad time. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, I am sure he will be safe <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure too. Just still so worried about him. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Four is a pretty cool number. I am a bigger fan of 5, though. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry. I meant to say I cared for my dad one time. I just felt like I had to make sure he felt better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had to bury my Golden retriever today. I had him for 10 years. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm so sorry.  I feel you.  I lost my sweet springer spaniel, Pepper, not long ago. Are you coping okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been feeling well and my husband has been so great. He takes care of the kids, goes grocery shopping, and makes sure I'm resting. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice to have someone that is helpful around the house.  Does he work, too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a little nervous about dating <endOfText>
<human> why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its impressive when a team can snag away a start player from another team <endOfText>
<human> It is.  What are you referring to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 50 Big Macs yesterday. Felt slightly bad for the herd of homeless across the street, gazing enviously upon my pile of gluttony. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. How did you manage to eat that many? Maybe you should have shared.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow. How did you manage to eat that many? Maybe you should have shared. <endOfText>
<human> I have quite a large stomach. Only the biggest meals will sate my absurd appetite. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister graduated from high school and my parents bought her a car. I didnt get a car when I graduated. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. How does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Very envious. But she is the youngest so she always got her way. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that's how it was with my younger brother too. He always go his way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared going home alone! <endOfText>
<human> That’s no good. Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt a little let down when I had to leave work <endOfText>
<human> why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my medicine today, one that helps me focus my attention span. I needed it especially because I had a job interview that I wanted to be sharp for. I felt weird during the interview, and now I don't know how I did.. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that sucks. When do you find out if you got the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I threw up all over the bus yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible! I'm sorry that happened to you. I hope everything is okay now. Do you know what caused it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just bought a new house, and she is only 25. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty impressive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She has been working and saving money since she was 15. Very determined young lady. <endOfText>
<human> That is really something to be proud of <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wishing that he would call me <endOfText>
<human> Why not just call him? Its not unheard of. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my golf clubs yesterday after I thought I lost them at the golf course. <endOfText>
<human> That is a good news. Did he kept them with him for a long period of time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my brother because he is better than me in sport. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. What sport? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job as a nurse next Monday and I'm so nervous. Nothing can prepare you for the real world of nursing compared to nursing school. <endOfText>
<human> i can understand that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was nice taking care of my sisters dog the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh fun!  What kind of dog does she have?  What's its name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kept playing a card game with my brothers, and I kept losing. They were bragging over and over, and being disrespectful. I just wanted to spend quality time with them... It gets frustrating sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes sibling rivalry dies hard -- even when you've well outgrown it. Are y'all far apart in age? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can’t wait to go on a blind date". <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where did you meet your date? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a fat ole rat slinking around my garage when I was taking the garbage out. <endOfText>
<human> That is nasty. What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my school reunion alone , my husband couldnt make it. I saw a lot of old boyfriends there. <endOfText>
<human> How did that feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kind of fun, But I let them know I am married and very much love my husband. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in a long disance relationship <endOfText>
<human> That must be hard sometimes, but I guess also has its advantages.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must be hard sometimes, but I guess also has its advantages. <endOfText>
<human> I am not interested in anyone else and I am busy with my kids but I miss him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been studying for my math test all this week. Never felt so prepared in my life. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome.  What level of math is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old teddy bear in a box from a storage unit today. It really brought back some memories. <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool! What kind of memories resurfaced? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was schocked when i had to go home early <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What happened?  I hope everything is  okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew a coworker wanted a project at work but I volunteered for it anyway. <endOfText>
<human> did he get ma? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm kind of ticked off because my friend that I work with got promoted to manager. I really feel like I should've gotten the job and I know she knows that! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, my friend. How do you think it is going to affect your friendship> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling uneasy about going to court <endOfText>
<human> Why are you going to the court? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the bus without paying for it. I feel bad afterward. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was totaly destroyed when I found that my wife took all the money that was in the bank account and left me. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible. Were you able to do anything about it.? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my son was in elementary school he hated getting up and going to school. He used to throw a fit in the car in front of the school. <endOfText>
<human> Ir is almost all kid that do that. He will get used to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was saddenned to see Lebron Go <endOfText>
<human> oh yea im not surprised though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about my interview <endOfText>
<human> What is your interview for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a break from work, so I went to the park to read my favorite book. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really peaceful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister and I went through some old pictures <endOfText>
<human> I bet that brought back memories. Hopefully good ones.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet that brought back memories. Hopefully good ones. <endOfText>
<human> It sure did.  She had a lot of pics I didn’t know of <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I changed my baby's diaper for the first time ever today. <endOfText>
<human> how did it go? congrats btw <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> last week i felt all alone when the family left <endOfText>
<human> Why did your family leave? Sorry that you felt that way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My turtle ran away from me today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god. Did you guys have a fight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt sad when I was all alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Why were you all alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just released from the hospital yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow.. how are you feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke up with my boyfriend a month ago. It was hard but he just wasn't right for me. The biggest problem I have now is that I feel so isolated and lonely without him. <endOfText>
<human> It was the right thing to do. Getting used to not having someone around is going to take some time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is finally coming back to the states after being away for 4 years. <endOfText>
<human> What a monumental event!  I bet you're so excited.  What took her away for so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the carpet yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Is the dog potty trained? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This bird chased my cat on our walk <endOfText>
<human> Did your cat show the bird who's boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you seen the show sharp objects? <endOfText>
<human> No I haven't. Is it good?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I haven't. Is it good? <endOfText>
<human> I like it. Its kind of scary to me though. I don't think its supposed to be scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds interesting. I will have to check it out. <endOfText>
<human> You should. With the lights on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will. But I dont scare easily. <endOfText>
<human> Then you are nothing like me lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister who was my best friend passed away. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad. I'm sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thank you. Now I dont have anyone really to talk to or do things with. <endOfText>
<human> Have you ever tried writing? That's what I do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about not being ready for the party on Friday <endOfText>
<human> You're hosting a party? or attending one? Either way, social gatherings can always be a lot of pressure, so that's why I usually avoid them, unfortunately. What are some of your worries, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching my cousin, who is only 13-years-old, being a pretty good motherly figure towards my 7-year-old nephew while were hanging out today. It's interesting to see how well she performs at a young age when dealing with kids, and how patient she stays when most adults wouldn't be able to <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took me 3 hours to mow the lawn. I'm glad it's done. <endOfText>
<human> damn did you do it all alone or you had help? are you lebron james living in a mansion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was all alone last week when my dog got out <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that! Did you find your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bowling alley all alone yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. You didn't have anyone to go with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a group project, and everyone was delegated their parts <endOfText>
<human> Did everyone end up contributing to the project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Passed by my old classroom. Looking in, it made me miss the time I suffered in the back through lecture <endOfText>
<human> Lectures can be boring <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been trying to save money for a big vacation next summer. <endOfText>
<human> where you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when i wasnt approved for time off the other day <endOfText>
<human> why did they say no? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> too much work.. no one able to take off <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry.. I wish I could fix that for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the skating rink all by myself yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like it could be fun, or was it sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I ate sugar the other day. I am on keto and it's a pain to cook the sweet treats I can have. <endOfText>
<human> That is too bad. Why are you on the keto diet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to do well on my history finals. I studied hard <endOfText>
<human> History is a lot of memorizing. Glad you did well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was supposed to be a party this weekend, but it got cancelled. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well, there is always next weekend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At dinner with my friends, I choked on water and coughed it up all over the food <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord, that made me almost vomit! I choke easy too, I am sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I have a hard time eating, I am allergic to so much! It gives me a lot of mixed feelings when thinking of eating. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know that feeling. What are some of the things that you can eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing scares me more than a snake. <endOfText>
<human> I do hate those too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very calm this last vacation. It was just very relaxing <endOfText>
<human> Sounds nice.. where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has been struggling through treatments for colon cancer. I am trying to be as supportive and helpful as I can. I try to go to every chemotherapy treatment she gets since her family isn't nearby. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's terrible but good she has you. I have had many family members that had that fight.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww, that's terrible but good she has you. I have had many family members that had that fight. <endOfText>
<human> How did you encourage them?  I try to be compassionate and uplifting but finding the right combination is tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They ran out of my favorite dessert at the restaurant I went to. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just went with fruits. <endOfText>
<human> thats a good selection <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was impressive when lebron left the cavs for the lakers <endOfText>
<human> I'm not familiar with basketball. Why would it be hard for him to leave? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is having his first baby! <endOfText>
<human> Thats exciting.  Do they know what they are having? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy.  I got an A in my online class. <endOfText>
<human> Online classes takes some dedication versus going to class. Good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> College is starting in 3 weeks, and I have my apartment all settled, my classes picked out, and my student loans scheduled. I feel like I'm on track to start the semester in a way where I'm not hurried or confused, and it feels good. <endOfText>
<human> That is really good.  Starting off right is one of the most important things for a successful School year.  Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I picked up my son from daycare today and they said another kid had pushed him over and taken his toy. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes kids don't know how to interact well with each other. But it's an important part of the socializing part of life that they work their way through it. All you can do is tell them how to respectfully and appropriately respond and defend themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mad when I failed my science test. I knew I should have done better <endOfText>
<human> It happens even when we study hard sometimes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sister just went back to school at 30 years old. <endOfText>
<human> Good for her. Never too late to go back to school. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Clown movies scare me. <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you. Those things are creepy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not very close with my family. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that, I am not either with some of my family! We are not always born in too families that are like us, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was but its never good when we get together. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, are they very mean or abusive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home and my outside window to my cat room was broken. <endOfText>
<human> Cat room? I've never heard of such a thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No. They had a screen in front of it- the window opens out- It's old- but I don't understand who broke it? And who was in my yard? <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should get cameras <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had family visiting for the past couple of days, some cousins and an uncle and aunt that I haven't seen a long time. It's always great to be reunited with family, especially after you get over that first initial weird social hump of feeling each other out after not having spoken for a long time. It's crazy to see how much the younger cousins have physically changed! Anyway, it's been a blast playing games and catching up with them. <endOfText>
<human> wow thats great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hapy when i got to leave work early! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that's never something to complain about--well, unless you were fired, I guess, but that doesn't sound like that was the case! I'm happy for you, too. Did you do anything fun with your extra time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I bought a bunch of scratch offs today.  I really wanna win the lottery. <endOfText>
<human> Fun!  Those can be addictive for me.  I only get them around Christmas time...not sure why but its a fun stocking stuffer.  Did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning a birthday party for my mom and she lives in another state. So I'm using a caterer that lives near her and banking on them doing a good job. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow.. are you going there to surprise her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My laptop broke, and I lost all the information on it. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good. So no way to get the info back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear happy when I hear this song on the radio. It makes me think of my dad when I was younger <endOfText>
<human> Does your dad still live nearby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was hair in my soup, and the owner wouldn't take responsibility. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross! What restaurant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have a vacuum for a day and my vacuum hasn't been working for awhile anyhow, so my floor was pretty dirty. <endOfText>
<human> Yea. Floors get dirty pretty quickly with dust. Will you be replacing the vacuum? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved watching my sisters dog the other day <endOfText>
<human> What breed is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the beach one time walking by the pier and I saw a diaper floating in the water. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I hope it was a clean diaper. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going camping next weekend. I haven't hung out with my friends in so long. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like so much fun.  I hope you have a good, relaxing time.  Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have started to makes schedules for myself everyday <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Are you getting the hang of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite store is going through some tough times. They're trying to find another distributor so they don't have to raise prices and lose their customers. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. What store is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got cable installed <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Is this your first time having that done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a big piece of cheesecake yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I love cheesecake <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait till tomorrow I am going to the mall. <endOfText>
<human> What stores are you going to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared when a tornado hist close to me. I thought I was going to die <endOfText>
<human> oh my gosh!  I am glad you are ok!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved it when i watched my sisters dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh dogs are so sweet. Was it your first time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A girl was actually hitting on me. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched my daughter be born this morning. It was one of the best days of my life! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing, first child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very shocked that they had a bunch of deli turkey on clearance with so many people shopping today! <endOfText>
<human> Isn't that the best feeling when something you really want is actually on deep discount, and you are just in the right place at the right time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew my favorite soccer team was going to do well. I had a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad they won! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an extra 2 days paid time off from work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet you enjoyed that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my brother didnt show up to my birthday. I really wanted him there <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, why didn't he come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke a window in my side yard today. I don't know when, I assume I was gone as my dogs wouldv'e went nuts. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good. I am glad they are okay though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister got invited on an all expense paid beach trip by one of our mutual friends. I can't believe she's getting to go and I haven't had a vacation in 3 years. <endOfText>
<human> You seem a bit jealous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a Christmas ornament my daughter made for me when she was younger <endOfText>
<human> How precious!  How old is she now?  What does the ornament look like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was confident about my final test. I had studied all week hard <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What subject was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to be going on vacation, but one of my coworkers quit suddenly. <endOfText>
<human> Thats bad timing for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep everything my kids make <endOfText>
<human> You are a good parent.  How do you have space for it all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I looked at a recipe that I wanted for dinner tonight, and I actually had everything I needed to make it. <endOfText>
<human> Thats always a plus <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I happy to see my brother last weekend. It had been a long time <endOfText>
<human> Does he live far away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the best friend I have had for he last 10 years will always be my best friend <endOfText>
<human> That's so neat when friendships last so long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little lonesome last weekend. I was sick and my friends were busy <endOfText>
<human> No one came to take care of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so luck that I had healthy children. <endOfText>
<human> Healthy is important <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when my aunt came to my graduation, She lived far away <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, you must have been thrilled! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter didnt have a good first year at her new school. <endOfText>
<human> Thats not good, I remember bad times at school. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The birds in my neighborhood all gather on my fence if I haven't feed them that day. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of birds are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous when starting a new school. I knew no one <endOfText>
<human> That can be one of the hardest parts of life. Very tough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very upset and a bit disgusted by that the person I live with still doesn't like paying bills. You have to pay bills to have things <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, roommates can be annoying sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has been so busy with work lately, it's left me feeling neglected. But she's working hard to pay off her student loans and to build her savings, so I have to respect that. But at the same time, we're long distance, so the time I have with her when she actually isn't working isn't that fulfilling, either. <endOfText>
<human> That's really too bad. I know how that feels. Have you tried telling her how you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really glad to see how hard my son is working <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a good kid. What has he been working on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We finished painting most of my brother's room today. I think we'll be able to get his room done well before he comes back next weekend. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice of you.  Where has he been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got in a bit of an altercation with a co-worker today, and I'm afraid it may lead to me losing my job. It started with a misunderstanding,and when they didn't want to simply accept that it was a misunderstanding after I apologized, I decided to simply defend myself and there was a verbal back-and-forth witnessed by a few people. This is not the image I wanted to have at my job... <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes you gotta stand up for yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A possom was waiting outside my door. <endOfText>
<human> Talk about an unwelcome guest! I would have immediately slammed my door shut! I never know how to respond in those situations, as in whether or not they're dangerous, etc. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had lost my iPad in an airport a week ago, and even though it had my contact information, I wasn't sure it'd be returned to me. I just figured it was gone for. But it showed up today, in the same condition! <endOfText>
<human> You are so lucky! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am still goin to court for child support. <endOfText>
<human> That must be incredibly annoying to have to deal with. To constantly have to battle for what you feel is justified support, and to always be worrying about it in the back of your head. You have to be really resilient to go through that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was aggravated at myself when I failed my science test. I could have done more <endOfText>
<human> Don't be too hard on yourself. You taught yourself a lesson for next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to deal with an entitled person lately and I can't stand it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  I have experienced that before and its not pleasant.  Its hard to be kind and careful with your speech and actions when you're near a snob. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a ticket today for not coming to a complete stop at a stop sign. So I stopped but they didn't think it was long enough. Ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh! So you have corrupt police officers in your town too? That is a bummer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes.  I'm a great driver with a perfect record but did I get a warning?  No.  I got a ticket but I'm going to contest it in court. <endOfText>
<human> I would too! Most officers dont show up for that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is doing her best to put me through college on her own. She raised me and my brother by herself, and while doing so she put enough aside to cover a chunk of my college expenses somehow. I guess she invested some of they money her grandparents left her, and it turned out to really pay off. She surprised me with this and I had no idea she was going to do that. I don't deserve her. <endOfText>
<human> Your mom is awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids are my favorite people in the world. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? That sounds awesome. That's how it should be! Can you tell me a little bit about them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like to go shopping at big stores. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping my brother is going to make my birthday. He can get busy though with work <endOfText>
<human> I hops so too! Work does come first or the bills can't be paid! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just accomplished one of my biggest dreams and I feel like things are just perfect right now. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Enjoy it! What did you accomplish if I may ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I am in a relationship kind of..but they are away and I can't talk to them so I am quite lonely. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that.  When will you see them again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've owned 3 birds in the past 10 years and my 3rd bird just died last night. I didn't realize how much it would crush me. They were my buddies. <endOfText>
<human> There's absolutely nothing I can say to make you feel better about that. I'm sorry for your great losses. Just from those few sentences alone, I can tell you were very passionate about them. What were their names, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My significant other woke up last night with... a roach inside of her ear! She was complaining about pain in her ear, and a head ache that was incredibly severe. So, we took her to the doctor and he saw it with a light... and put water in her ear to get it out. Disgusting! <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross!  I've heard of flies or ants being in an ear, but a roach?  That gives me chills because I hate roaches sooooo much.  Now I might have nightmares tonight! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Grocery shopping today was the worst <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a bit irritated when the police bothered me the other night when I was simply walking. They do this a lot here. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It can be hard to wake up sometimes when you live alone. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine that. I've never lived alone before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got a new job after being without one for a couple months now. <endOfText>
<human> That is great! Being without a job can be very scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The mechanic who came to fix our air conditioner overcharged us by $200 <endOfText>
<human> Yu should report him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I just love sitting around doing nothing <endOfText>
<human> That is doing something. It's what we call relaxing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went by my old school, and so much has changed. <endOfText>
<human> That happens over time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My electric bill is twice as high as last month <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my roomie if he wanted cake, and he said no. Turns out he ate all my cake. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an Italian restaurant for dinner earlier. <endOfText>
<human> How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's nothing like being in your house after all your relatives have left after coming over for a long weekend visit. It's nice to see them, but once the frenetic energy is done with and you can kick your feet up... it's rewarding <endOfText>
<human> yes! Yin and yang, it's hard to appreciate the quiet without the loud :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to getting a new vacuum on Tuesday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I love cleaning, so tools to do it with that are new are always welcomed. What kind of brand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost got hit by a semi truck today on the highway. It scared me half to death. <endOfText>
<human> Woah! I'm soooo glad you're okay!  Those big rigs are so dangerous and make me so nervous.  I stay as far away from them as I can. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a little cat I tried to help last night. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY children are making me mad <endOfText>
<human> What are they doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were having a big family gathering and dinner today, and one of my nephews, who's four, wasn't feeling well. But his parents kept trying to force him to eat something anyway, and were being short-sighted. Well, the poor fella ended up puking onto his plate and ending everyone's appetite. <endOfText>
<human> I feel sorr for the poor guy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend worked really hard this semester. I'm sure he'll do great. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of you to say about someone else. It's nice when someone can recognize someone else's hard work and dedication without feeling jealous or annoyed. I'm sure he knows how proud of him you are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get a chance to make dinner for my date, so I got her McDonalds <endOfText>
<human> Oops.  That's doesn't have to be a bad thing.  No one can resist fries from McDonalds.  How did she react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is coming home after a year abroad in the Army. I'm about to burst I'm so happy! <endOfText>
<human> You must really miss him! So glad you'll finally be reunited with him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My momand I were discussing starting a non profit the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That's a great idea!  For what cause though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something that helps kids with clothing and other essentials for school. <endOfText>
<human> That is very thoughtful of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I found my gold fish floating at the top of the fish tank dead. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That has happened to us so many times. I thought fidh were easy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Learned earlier today that I had been drinking all day out of a cup that had been used earlier by someone who has bronchitis. I'm hoping it's not too contagious... Why can't people properly clean and put things away so I don't confuse dirty dishes with clean dishes! <endOfText>
<human> People can be inconsiderate sometimes. I hope you don't get sick! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ended up getting a pizza from Costco. I'm so hungry <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, Costco pizza is great, and so cheap, too. It may not be the best, but for the price and quantity, you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend borrow my car today <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of you.  What did they need to use it for?  Were you able to live without it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What?!! That's terrible.  I don't understand how people don't take care of things that don't belong to them when its a privilege to use borrowed things. <endOfText>
<human> I know. She lost that privilege <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought a lawn mower because mine broke and the grass was getting so long. I barely had it 3 days when my shed was broken into and it was stolen! I'm so irate! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Some people ar just no good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up one morning and found a puppy in my bed. I wasn't expecting that! <endOfText>
<human> Whoa! Was that a good surprise, or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way, but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well, actually it was in my parent's bed, and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents, and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lent my car to my 17-year-old sister today. She left at 10 in the morning and it's midnight, and she still isn't back with it. I trust her mostly, but she hasn't been driving for long, and it makes me nervous thinking of her out there on the road <endOfText>
<human> Did you call her? I hope she's ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a year of unlimited pizza. I'm so psyched. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is awesome! <endOfText>
<human> Yea, it is. If I'm ever tired of cooking, I can always get pizza. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready to light a candle and bingewatch <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice. What will you be binge watching? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw firsthand today how caring my cousin can be with children. She was being patient and cooperative with my unruly and difficult two-year-old nephew, and she's only 13-years-old herself. I was pretty proud of how she handled the difficult situation, and it made me imagine her as a mother in the future. <endOfText>
<human> She will do great. OR she might not want to have kids be he is such a handful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends are always flaking on me <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Sometimes it's hard to know who your real friends are, and it takes repeated attempts to hang out with them, only to have them bail on you, to realize that you're not valued by them. I say cut your ties sooner rather than later. Life's too short. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a battle of the bands going on. I hope my favorite band gets so far <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I accidentally stepped in dog feces. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Someone did pick up their dog's poop, hu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet once but someone returned it to me. felt good. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it did. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought lots of snacks for the kids lunches this month <endOfText>
<human> oh that was good of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took off work to go to a concert, but it got cancelled. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a bummer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been really sick, and my cat has been taking care of me <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet of your cat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am taking care of my sister when she get out of the hospital <endOfText>
<human> Good for you.You are an exampler brother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy theses days. <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear.  Anything in particular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking back home today, and I had to go through the front yard. The summer time means lots of rain, and so the grass gets a little tall. While I was walking through it, I stepped on a snake! I screamed like a little baby and jogged away really fast <endOfText>
<human> Oh god that's terrifying haha. I hate snakes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My senior year wasn't nearly as good since my brother left for college that same year. <endOfText>
<human> That's tough. I have two older brothers, so I know how that is. We're separated by four and eight years, respectively, so we weren't as close as you two seem to be, but I always liked having them around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing with football with my two nephews, just throwing the ball around, and I threw the ball too high and hard for my younger nephew. It sailed past him and nailed the neighbor's car behind him, and left a dent in the door. I felt so stupid having to go up to their house and tell them what happened.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  My gut feels sick for you having to go through that.  It happens to all of us but its so painful and awkward.  How did the neighbors take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't played my flute in years. Picked it up the other day, and I was still able to play my favorite songs. <endOfText>
<human> That is cool.  When did you learn? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for summer to be over soon <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's rare. How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought my parents a new car last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's nice of you! What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really sucked, since a month ago I was dating this girl and she dumped me so early on. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry.  Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week was my birthday and I had to work. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Did you get a raincheck on your birthday though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked to an apartment and it took me a while to realize I was in the wrong apartment. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Was someone in there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for having so much land <endOfText>
<human> That's good to have land you own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The store I usually buy bird food from raised their prices at least 4 times. <endOfText>
<human> That isn't cool.  Is there anyone else that sells it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very happy right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's great.  What is the good news? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the next season of Game of Thrones! <endOfText>
<human> Oh me too! I heard it will be the last one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so glad I can talk to my parents about things <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. I always had communication problems with my parents  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for you. I always had communication problems with my parents <endOfText>
<human> That is common.  I feel very fortunate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so disappointed on Trump <endOfText>
<human> You and me both my friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love seeing old friends. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, how long has it been since? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just got engaged to his girlfriend! <endOfText>
<human> That’s awesome!  Is she a good one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend convinced me to go see a new band perform at a local club. I went along even though I was expecting it to be lame. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice. I just recenlt had a baby. It was amazing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am confident the democrats will bet Trump in november. <endOfText>
<human> That's interesting. What makes you confident?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's interesting. What makes you confident? <endOfText>
<human> The recent results on the special elections, all democrats wins. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a little nervous at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> Is there a reason.Are you expecting bad news? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in awe with what I saw last week. <endOfText>
<human> What did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next week I am going camping with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck in your camping.I hope you have a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty sure I am going to get this planning done soon <endOfText>
<human> What are you planning? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband thinks we should have another baby. <endOfText>
<human> What do you think? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so piss off at the Democrats. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What did they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I saw a ghost outside! <endOfText>
<human> Really?? You probably were been very scared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I felt very inclined. <endOfText>
<human> Inclined to do what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was nice to have an adult gathering with no kids with family <endOfText>
<human> Yes! sometimes I like such gatherings <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I saw a person screaming at a puppy. <endOfText>
<human> Why would they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I don't usually get each other anything for Christmas but last year he got me a puppy which was so shocking. <endOfText>
<human> That was really sweet of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it was so nice, it made me really happy. He's very sweet. <endOfText>
<human> I am very happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling disappointed with myself. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you seen the football world cup final? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I did.I t was a great game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very scared for the USA <endOfText>
<human> What are you afraid of? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i got cat hair in my food today when eating a sandwich <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is really gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just graduated college with honors. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations.You must be very proud of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so alone these days. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good. What seems to be the cause? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very scary of the things Trump can do as a president <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Why would you be scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very angry right now. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.What is the reason for this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a car accident a couple days ago and I just got this new car. Not my fault, but still frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.Do you have full cover insurance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really thought that me and this girl were right for each other but things didn';t work out. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am so ready for Thanksgiving. <endOfText>
<human> Will you be hosting a Thanksgiving party at your home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I am allergic to cats. <endOfText>
<human> When did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the shelter to find an animal for my daughter, and I had a reaction to their Cats. <endOfText>
<human> I guess she didn't get a cat then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always watch the news at 7pm <endOfText>
<human> It is good to stay informed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from the church collection plate. <endOfText>
<human> That is very bad, you should return it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just washed my car last week because I was supposed to drive it through the parade. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. What kind of parade was it? <endOfText>

<human> It is great to have a brother you can count. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I deeply love my wife <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My phone broke, so a coworker offered to sell me an extra one he had for a decent price. <endOfText>
<human> Did you take the offer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not believe my dad was fired. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is horrible. Is he okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling very at peace today. <endOfText>

<human> That wasn't very nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just finished high school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really sucked since I took this girl on a date and she told me it went really well. Well apparently not since she dumped me after. <endOfText>
<human> How did she dump you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so lucky I got the scholarship. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow that is awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really hoped my mom would get her job the other day <endOfText>
<human> Did she not get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used my friend's car without permission. <endOfText>
<human> It is unacceptable for a friendship. I think you should not behave in such a way ever again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A week ago, my partner invited my relatives to my birthday without me knowing. It was a good surprise gift from her <endOfText>
<human> That is a very nice gesture by them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got demoted at work this past week. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole from my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what did you steal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first words the other day/ <endOfText>
<human> Really? That's amazing, what words? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time in high school it snowed and I really tried not to slip, but I did anyway. <endOfText>
<human> Did you hurt yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was dancing when I heard I will be a grandfather. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I thought it would rain so i brought an umbrella yesterday <endOfText>
<human> That was smart of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dumped my girlfriend yesterday for no reason. <endOfText>
<human> Did you do it in person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very nervous to be a father. <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry, you will be fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very pleased with the job Trump has done as president. <endOfText>
<human> That is good that you are happy about his efforts.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is good that you are happy about his efforts. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, and I hope he is elected again/ <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am ready for the work week. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Anything special happening? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not looking forward to jury duty. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am angry that I was fired today/ <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, why did you get fired? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Do you live in a place where it regularly rains? <endOfText>
<human> not really its sometimes tho. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Loneliness is worst that can happen to a human being. After a break up with my partner, i am feeling desperate for emotional coddling <endOfText>
<human> oh my gosh i completely agree on the loneliness thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a date at a very fancy restaurant the other night. <endOfText>
<human> oh my, was it worth it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I forgot my girlfriends name. <endOfText>
<human> How did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a twenty dollar bill on the ground today. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like this game League of Legends and looking at my old matches from years ago was really cool. <endOfText>
<human> I have never played that game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the end of summer party. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea im the same, gonna be wild. <endOfText>

<human> I love it too! It's really fancy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a centipede in my bedroom earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Did you run away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to become a homeowner and successfully got my mortgage last month <endOfText>
<human> Is this your first home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still can't believe my dad bought me a car. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. Many are getting into car loan and struggling with car payments <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will win gold at the Olympics. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss just bought a brand new Range Rover. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visit my grandma every week. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet of you> I am sure that makes her so happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend is away on business for a month. <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to do while he is away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will be a judge when I am older. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats a very big position. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was tall like Lebron James. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I was also tall. It must be nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Venus Fly-trap plant died yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> How long did you have it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The part of the project that we had been working on and that was very crucial, i completed it successfully, all on my own. I hope my manager would notice and promote me <endOfText>
<human> I am sure your hard work will pay off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son finally graduated high school. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful. Is he now considering going to college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother has a better job than me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, are you jealous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but I do not know if it's jealously, or regret that I did not make the same decisions that he did. <endOfText>
<human> You will find a good career. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone in my house ate the last slice of pizza. <endOfText>
<human> Did they have permission to take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet at work today. <endOfText>
<human> oh no! did you block your cards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a dog eating a dead bird on the ground. <endOfText>
<human> eww thats awful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i stayed in watching netflix last night for hours. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of competitor companies made me an offer to join them, but i rejected it and wanted to stay in my current organization out of loyalty <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like you were confident in your decision. Did you think it through? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really am looking forward to seeing if my parents will buy me a dog. <endOfText>
<human> Why your parents? Can't you buy it yourself, all on your own like a grown ups? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately, I have a disability that keeps me from leaving my home so I can't search for one myself. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. I think you should join your parents when they go shopping for a pet to a store <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a food competition show, and I was amazed at how cool this cake was that the chef made. <endOfText>
<human> I really love those types of shows. Remember what it was called? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really thought that physics was gonna be an easy class last semester. <endOfText>
<human> Physics is an interesting subject, but it can get difficult to understand sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a candy bar from a child yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's not very nice! Why'd you do that?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm thinking about building a new computer, but man do the parts cost a lot! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a fun project! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave my groceries at the store today. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you have to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had been working so hard practicing for his guitar solo in the concert. <endOfText>
<human> When and where is his first solo concert? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got pulled over by the police today. <endOfText>
<human> oh that really suckks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I was so scared when it happened. <endOfText>
<human> i see what you mean i would be too <endOfText>

<human> Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is possible flooding in my area. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. are you at an elevated area? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working there only 3 months, but they recognized my performance that early. It feels awesome to be appreciated <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! That is a good feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I auditioned for a play over the weekend. <endOfText>
<human> I'm afraid of public speaking or performing in crowds, so that takes courage! How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when a candy bar was only 50 cents. <endOfText>
<human> can you even find one like that now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend got a massive scholarship last year <endOfText>
<human> That's really impressive! Education is really important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this haunted house that was so scary! The characters would jump out at you around corners throughout the house! <endOfText>
<human> thats scary, i hate that stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was born in the late 80s but raised in the 90s. Seeing everyone dressed from the 90s brought back so many memories at the party. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it does. It is same for me. I was also raised in the 90s. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I are adopting a little girl. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds amazing! I love it when families adopt and give a loving child a home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so sad about my friend's new puppy that died suddenly. The puppy got so sick that it passed away in a few days. <endOfText>
<human> thats horrible so sad :/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so impressed with my son and how well he did in school this year. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My sister is moving in with us because she lost her house. <endOfText>
<human> So sorry to hear that. It's not easy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had no roommate in freshman year of college which was boring <endOfText>
<human> That does sound boring because you had no one to interact with, but at least you had some privacy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I volunteered at a homeless shelter yesterday, and it was an amazing experience. I feel so blessed to have all that I do. <endOfText>
<human> thats so nice of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Are you  a good driver? I seem to hit things a lot. <endOfText>
<human> I have never had an accident. Been driving for 22 years now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In our friend's birthday party, i saw my partner chatting with her male college friend. They seemed very joyful and it made feel jealous <endOfText>
<human> Maybe it is your imagination.The were probably catching up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am baffled about the USA economy <endOfText>
<human> It seems under Trump, the economy is booming as he promised <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my father so much. <endOfText>
<human> That is sad. Did he pass away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter loves to sing. She tried out for a musical recently. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I don't know what I would do without my parents. <endOfText>
<human> Me either,  they have done so much for me in my life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There are alot of people in need of care in this world. <endOfText>
<human> Yes there are. It is so sad. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Last night i was with my friends hanging out, but lied to my partner about it and told that i will be at work staying late. I did not to hear more nagging from her <endOfText>
<human> Well that's not right no matter what your excuse because now you're not trustworthy see <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved into my first house by myself and haven't had time to clean or unpack. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like it is exciting but also a lot of work.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like it is exciting but also a lot of work. <endOfText>
<human> My mom knew I was stressed so she came and unpacked and cleaned the whole house while I was at work so that I would see it when I got home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The project was worth more than a million dollars <endOfText>
<human> wow, And did you ever end up finishing the project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I see,  what did you do instead <endOfText>
<human> Still finalizing on the contract paper work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes social situations make me so uncomfortable. <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes I dont understand why but I just get this crazy feeling inside <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes I do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sucks but they do say distance makes the heart grow fonder. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not sure what you mean, but disntance does tend to make things more difficult <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend never paid me back the money I loaned him! <endOfText>

<human> Aw, that's adorable! I bet he's the cutest thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a woman at my boyfriend's work that pays him too much attention.  He doesn't think there is anything wrong but I am ready to knock her out. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand your feelings. That's a tough situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I broke up and he moved out. <endOfText>
<human> That's really tough.  But one closed door leads to the next great opportunity. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I'm drinking a great cup of coffee and I don't have any major plans for the day other than relaxing. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a nice plan.  Do you often get the chance to take days off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Great UFC fights last night.  An even better night because I was hanging out with friends <endOfText>
<human> Friends and UFC sounds like a great night!  I missed the fight.  Were there any good knock outs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really praying that I get a promotion at work! I need the extra money and my boss knows I want it badly! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you get it too!  Best of luck!  We all could use extra money in the pocket! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a date tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds promising.  Are you coming out of long dry spell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling so pleasant and happy lately. Things in my life have just been going perfectly. <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow that's awesome for you!  How are you feeling today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a vacation coming up :) <endOfText>
<human> Awesome!  You must be excited!  Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog just threw up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did it eat something bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a job interview friday, and I think it went well. <endOfText>
<human> oh cool.. Is it in the field you like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I found a stray dog last night and took him home with me. <endOfText>
<human> What a nice thing to do.  Do you know what breed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Buying some new clothes and packing <endOfText>
<human> Are you also going for a trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog can now shake hands on command. <endOfText>
<human> I love when my dog does that.  Did it take you long to train him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed this week's meeting and asked a co-worker to e-mail me of any changes about the project. He did not even bother himself to inform me <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, so did you waste a lot of time on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi!  I planned a get together at my house and was surprised. <endOfText>
<human> What happened?  Do tell :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh Snap!  wow... That was a surprise! <endOfText>
<human> It turned out to be a fun night. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The rain cancelled my plans for today. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry.  That has been happening a lot lately on the East Coast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yeah.. my goldfish died this morning. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. Did you give him a burial at sea? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Indeed I did, hence my emotions. <endOfText>
<human> Do you plan on getting another fish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad.. my dogs wont stop barking and I am going absolutely nuts <endOfText>
<human> I feel you, nothing irritates me more than a dog that won't stop barking.  Any plans to fix the problem? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a invite to go camping next weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Is it something that you want to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't paying attention and locked my keys in the car. I was livid as I did not have a spare. <endOfText>
<human> Did you pay a locksmith to come get it open for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start my new job this week. Feeling a little uneasy.. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats!! That's wonderful. why do you feel unease ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know.. new people.. fresh start.. the unknown.. <endOfText>
<human> i understand. It is hard to start but i'm sure you will make new friends at your new job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wife so much, i would never be able to cheat on her. i don't know how some people can cheat on their spouses <endOfText>
<human> Well I love my husband and I have cheated so it really one doesn't have much to do with the other. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Anytime I have a family get together coming up, like during the holidays, I get super anxious and worry non-stop about it <endOfText>
<human> Same here.  Is it because of needed prepartations or because of family drama? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ive suffered from anxiety and sciatica for years , the anxiety since i was small , one day i ordered cbd oil in hopes it would go away <endOfText>
<human> what is CBD oil? I feel bad for you.. i fell you though, i recently started having bad anxiety attacks, i will see a doctor in 2 weeks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like how older kids ignore your messages. <endOfText>
<human> It can be infuriating.  Do you call or send texts? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped in fell face first at a bar last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were you drunk! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little boy just turned 5 and he's about to start kindergarten :( <endOfText>
<human> Look on the bright side, you'll have some extra free time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ive been working as a part timer at a store for 3 years, recently they offered my management position instead of a full time position , i was in shock <endOfText>
<human> Now that's a nice surprise.  You must have really impressed them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ive always been a good worker, i even tell management when they are messing up and correct them , im still not sure if want management but im still very surprised <endOfText>
<human> I'd take it.  You sound like you might be good at it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It hasn't rained here in a while and I have to water my yard today so it dosen't die. <endOfText>
<human> i wish i could send our rain your way! It's been raining here for weeks!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll filled with hope whenever I've been in church. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. Religion can be a source of hope and optimism for many people in times of distress <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, very good stress relief. So I never miss any Sunday! <endOfText>
<human> I also try to find some time and attend church services whenever possible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everytime I take my kids to the pool. I feel so content while they run around and have fun. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a good time.  I'm not surprised. Do you take them often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dog died. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's so rough. I had a dog die a few years ago and it was traumatic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved out of my parents house and into my own apartment. <endOfText>
<human> that's really good! Huge step :) How do you like your new place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so happy I found a new job! We've been struggling financially for a couple of months and i'm so thankful for my wife who was super supportive <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! I bet that makes you feel great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be afraid of the dark but now I am not so much, I had a nightlight for a long time <endOfText>
<human> good for you my friend! Darkness is nothing to be scared about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros for the nintendo switch, I hope it is really good! <endOfText>
<human> I hear great reviews, people who have played it are raving about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at dinner last night with friends and I lost my wallet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh shoot.. What did you do? did you find it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm about to have my third child and can't wait to finally have this baby. The nursery is done, the clothes are ready, and I'm packed for the hospital. Good to go. <endOfText>
<human> By this time you probably have the process all down pat! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movies last night and made a fool of myself. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> To be honest, my smartphone is pretty old and i do not have enough money to get new one <endOfText>
<human> tell me about it! My phone keeps freezing and it's so slow.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> tell me about it! My phone keeps freezing and it's so slow. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, this is what really frustrates me and I am losing myself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very athletic and smart and just got promoted, I wish I was that good <endOfText>
<human> I can relate.  I have a colleague that seems better at everything than me and is now supervisor.  Just don't let jealousy take over your life. That will only hurt you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor just decided that while I was gone on vacation, they would dig up a tree they don't like hanging into their yard. They dug a big hole right in my backyard! My blood is boiling still. <endOfText>
<human> They went into your yard to take the tree out?? Is that even legal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, its definitely illegal especially because we got the property lines plotted around our houses to end the matter.  I was so shocked I can't even tell you.  Now I have to waste good money securing a lawyer. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, well I hope it is a simple case and you get reimbursed heavily! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids were being so bad the other day I yelled at them and felt guilty afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> Some times kids deserved to be yelled at. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost 20 lbs. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I just started working out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and all of my friends, I was very lonley. That was a dark time in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, how sweet. Tell the little one that i said congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was hoping to win the lottery last week <endOfText>
<human> That would have been nice, gotta play to win as my grandma always said <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devestated when my grandmother passed away, that was a very sad time for me <endOfText>
<human> sorry hear that. <endOfText>

<human> Hey that's awesome!  Congrats! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to a funeral the other day <endOfText>
<human> Was it someone you were close to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not really.  He lived with me YEARS ago but since moved back to his state he came from.  I'm closer to the family though. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well I am still sorry for your loss <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did a Mud Run last week and had so much fun except when my shorts got so thick with mud that we were crawling through that they fell down and I couldn't keep them up. Red face for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.. I hope you were not hurt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> I feel you buddy.. Family is above everything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> don't feel sad,day will pass and present is the best moment and live <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> every annoying situation in our organization my coworker helps me gentle and loyal <endOfText>
<human> thats a good person to have around it appears <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> do you having any faithful moment with our coworker <endOfText>
<human> nah i am a supervisor so we really cant discuss anything going on with them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the gorcery store this morning but, I forgot my wallet at home and did not realize it until I was already in the checkout line. <endOfText>
<human> oh man :( i hate when it happens! Did you have to go home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yesterday i called my wife a punk.. she didn <endOfText>
<human> She waht? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very athletic and smart and just got promoted, I wish I was that good <endOfText>
<human> don't be so hard on yourself! I'm sure there is something you are really good at and he is not <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stand trump.He is a disgrace to the presidency of the USA <endOfText>
<human> holddddd up.. he is making america great again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> You don't have any friends or family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> nah cause trump took my kid away after i illegally entered the country <endOfText>
<human> That means that you are right now at an immigration detention, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting a job next week in a new school as a teacher and I have to give a speech in front of the entire school. Pubic speaking in front of that many people isn't my favorite thing. <endOfText>
<human> I have heard that if you look at one person in the audience and focus on them in their underwear you will relax <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went to the pool last week and I made sure to bring everything I needed. <endOfText>
<human> did any competition have you attend in pool  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> did any competition have you attend in pool <endOfText>
<human> No, we just go for my kids to swim and wear themselves out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that good it makes you healthy <endOfText>
<human> Yes,, it's good exercise for everyone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> love all,trust a few,do wrong to none <endOfText>
<human> That's a good way of saying live a good life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes,be pleasant with every one <endOfText>
<human> Treat everyone the way you want to be treated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting to hear back on whether or not I got accepted into law school <endOfText>
<human> That is impressive. Which law school have you applied? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My credit score has seen a 50 point decrease in the last month. I think this is a result of my debt accumulation <endOfText>
<human> Ouch.  Debt ration does play a big factor in the scoring. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a spider crawling on my bed. <endOfText>
<human> damn.. what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad the other day when i couldnt leave work on time <endOfText>
<human> I know your pain. I used to have to stay over often as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> good friends always helps you in every up and down situation without any expectation <endOfText>
<human> You have to have a good friend though for any help. Without a friend there is not help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes my friend help me <endOfText>
<human> You are lucky to have a friend willing to help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very athletic and smart and just got promoted, I wish I was that good <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was devestated when my grandmother passed away, that was a very sad time for me <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to see that i was able to get a new pet the other day <endOfText>
<human> What pet did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my laptop and broke it. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, how much will it cost to replace? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devestated when my grandmother passed away, that was a very sad time for me <endOfText>
<human> That's sad to hear. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> last night I was in bed and a spider came straight down from the ceiling fan onto the comforter. <endOfText>
<human> I would have peed myself, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been faithful to my girlfiend of almost 3 years <endOfText>
<human> and... ?  what is going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my family, they mean a lot to me and I do not know what I would do without them <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. My family is the only thing that keeps me going. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get my daughter the gift she wanted <endOfText>
<human> What did she ask for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend annoys me sometimes, but I guess that is what love is anyways <endOfText>
<human> I completely understand. Can't live with them, can't live without them.  ha ha ha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had friends over last night for the UFC fights.  It was a blast <endOfText>
<human> What fight did you watch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother once called me the black sheep infront of my entire family <endOfText>
<human> I am the black sheep in mine, self declared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy.. I went to the casino yesterday... <endOfText>
<human> I absolutely love the casino,  what is your slot machine of choice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy ate my leftovers after I asked him not to <endOfText>
<human> How rude!  Are you two roommates? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you watch the UFC fights last night <endOfText>
<human> Yes I love combat sports. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed without any warning to us <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, I lost my grandmother to cancer, which did not make it anny better, knowing it was coming <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros for the nintendo switch <endOfText>
<human> Ive always wanted a nintendo switch, Is it any good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to love pokemon, thinking back on it puts me in my feelings <endOfText>
<human> Yeah kids have moved on to YuGiYoh and other silly games. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disgusted when I saw a really big spider, I hate those things <endOfText>
<human> did you kill it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset the other day when i couldnt leave home on time <endOfText>
<human> Why, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros for the nintendo switch <endOfText>
<human> I love the switch, I have been thinking about buying my own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a stray puppy and nursed it back to health <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing, what breed was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trusting of my girlfriend, we have been dating almost 3 years now <endOfText>
<human> that's good that you trust her! It's hard to have a relationship if you don't have trust <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gained some weight when my wife was pregnant and now i finally lost 15 lbs. i feel great! <endOfText>
<human> That is good, it can be easy to sink into a bad lifestyle with a kid or stressed wife <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last vacation I collected rocks to take home and remember the trip by <endOfText>
<human> I do that too.. I take small tiny ones usually.  I have pieces of the grandcanyon and everything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really scared.  I moved into this new house and I swear to you it is haunted. <endOfText>
<human> WHAT?! do you hear noises at night? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my friend hold on to my wedding ring while I planned my proposal. <endOfText>
<human> what happened ? lost it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset the other day when i couldnt get home on time to get my kid to practice <endOfText>
<human> What happened? did you run into traffic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad!  I went outside and an armadillo was eating my plants. <endOfText>
<human> NO! they can be vermin,  what did you do to get rid of him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I yelled at it and told it to leave.  I live near a lake and all.. there is no getting rid of animals. <endOfText>
<human> Did he jump up and run away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once my card got declined and the employee put 5 dollars on my gas pump anyway <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of him..  Did you pay him back ever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I woke up to what i thought was a ghost in my room <endOfText>
<human> WHAT? I would be terrified!!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> WHAT? I would be terrified!! <endOfText>
<human> YES i was scared out of my mind, to this day I tell myself it was a dream. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't really trust people but i sure do trust my wife! She is so amazing, i know she would never lie to me, she simply can't lie <endOfText>
<human> Has she tried to lie before but just been a terrible liar? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the first day of class knowing it was going to be easy. <endOfText>
<human> that's good. did it actually turn out easy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was shocked when i couldnt go to the game i bought tickets for <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow!  What happened?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had to stay at work <endOfText>
<human> That stinks.  What did you do with your tickets? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, wow!  What happened? <endOfText>
<human> i had to stay at work  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I need to make a doctor's appointment, but I don't want to do it. <endOfText>
<human> why not? if it will possibly get you better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I did very good at my interview. I hope they call me back! <endOfText>
<human> Good luck. That's always nerve racking waiting for them to call. I'm sure you did well though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was schocked to see my favorite band wasnt coming to my city this tour <endOfText>
<human> What band is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a long week at work, I am at peace on this quiet Sunday morning. <endOfText>
<human> thats good.. any plans <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Driving sometimes gets me very nervous. I don't like the thought of getting in a deadly car accident. <endOfText>
<human> how long have you been driving <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it upset me to see that my dog to loose the other day <endOfText>
<human> Wait, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the mood to try some baking the other day, and I tried something really challenging.  It actually turned out pretty well. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's good, new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind. <endOfText>
<human> That's true.  It helps when the results taste good, too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to make it through some hard times when my parents were able to lend me some money to finish college. <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of them and lucky they were able to help you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was suprised when i saw this guy dunk the other ball the other day <endOfText>
<human> That's cool! Do you play basketball frequently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex girlfriend messaged me yesterday out the blue, i still do love her im just afraid of trying this all over again <endOfText>
<human> I would try again, if you love her you might regret not giving it another try if she moves on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like most of my friends are married with kids and as a single person I have no one to socialize with. <endOfText>
<human> I dont have kids either, sometimes when i go out with my friends im mainly the 3rd wheel and it feels weird , i feel your pain <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished signing the papers for my auto loan refinance! Waiting on a large refund for the GAp insurance! <endOfText>
<human> Great! Will this mean a lower car payment for you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Great! Will this mean a lower car payment for you? <endOfText>
<human> Yes! And a lower interest rate. I'm so happy. I can really use that extra money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin didn't even told me he was having a kid, I had to hear it from someone else. <endOfText>
<human> Did you guys ever fall out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I booked a vacation house on the coast and we drove to the place. Upon arriving the driveway was blocked with other people's cars, to which none of the owners were anywhere to be found. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been so frustrating!!! Were you able to find them fairly quickly? And how?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling positive about the economy these days <endOfText>
<human> That's terrific! Is there anything in particular that makes you feel good about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stand it when you talk to someone who doesn't know a lick of English. It makes everything so difficult... <endOfText>
<human> Language barriers can be pretty problematic. Always keep an open ear, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final exam for Linear Algebra coming in a week. I feel stressed out as I am not prepared <endOfText>
<human> Try to relax and think positive, visualize yourself acing the test. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust President Trump all the way <endOfText>
<human> It seems he is delivering on his promises. As you can see, the economic numbers are truly high <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting to get a low B or even a C in one of my hardest university courses. Instead, on the Final Exam there was bonus opportunity to which I came out with an A average. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I bet you feel so relieved! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat died :( <endOfText>
<human> oh when and why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The %4.1 US GDP growth for this year that was revealed is truly unbelievable. Who could have imagined such a number <endOfText>
<human> I did not know that it was that high! That's amazing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to get an interview for a great job, by the time I was going into it I felt that I knew everything they would require and I was not worried at all. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! You sound like you prepared very well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so mad when I see or hear about kids getting bullied. It is so unfair. <endOfText>
<human> it definetly is. I'm glad schools are taking a stance against it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been making music for over a decade, but still hasn't had success like some who've only been doing it for a year or two <endOfText>
<human> Making music is a hard business to break into. The only way to make it is to keep practicing and to get a little lucky. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is about to start her Master's program and I'm very proud of her. I like how much ambition she has. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's awesome and great that you're supporting her also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, you should have seen what just happened to me.. <endOfText>
<human> what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a hot rod show yesterday and saw a bunch of classic mustangs. <endOfText>
<human> Cool, do you like older cars? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year, the company I work for, provided with 10 days of paid vacation. I took a trip to Miami. It was amazing to visit the beaches <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I bet that was amazing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got my CCNA certification. <endOfText>
<human> oh that sounds good  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh that sounds good <endOfText>
<human> I hope to put it to use soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  had no income to pay my bond.  So I accepted the plea bargain just to get out of county jail sooner than later <endOfText>
<human> That's a wild occurrence. Jail can be harsh on anyone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt like vomiting when I saw a little boy at a restaurant drooling while his parents did nothing. He was eating but his drool and snot from his nose was leaking into his food! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's disgusting. They should take better care of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my friend went on bed rest during her pregnancy, I was confident that she would have a healthy baby. <endOfText>
<human> Is bed rest where you stop working? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took 2 months of constant waiting for me to get my results for a test that I spent 3 months preparing for. <endOfText>
<human> sounds like a lot of waiting. did you do well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one time I was on a boat and got stranded at see. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, did you have plenty of food and water? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so embarrassed. I just ate an entire bag of potato chips in one sitting! <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry, I do that all the time. I love binge eating lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting so much more from the movie but it sucked! Never again am I having my expectations so high for a movie.. <endOfText>
<human> It's awful when you spend money on tickets and popcorn and it's a bad time. Did they put all of the best moments in the trailer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job on Monday! I am excited but very nervous! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope you perform well and have a wonderful time. What is your profession? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a notification that I was eligible to receive a $1000 reward from one of the cards I use. I just had to wait and see what the outcome was in a few weeks. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great deal. Get the money and do something great with it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the movie Mile 22 to come out. I love seeing UFC fighters in movies! <endOfText>
<human> I have not seen any UFC movies. I guess I should watch one to give them a chance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am just by myself this weekend  and i do not like it <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible maybe getting out of the house and checking out our yard sale will cheer you up.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's terrible maybe getting out of the house and checking out our yard sale will cheer you up. <endOfText>
<human> That is a great idea, thanks for the tip <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking to this girl, we had amazing chemistry and then she ghosted. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. I have experienced similar things. I hope that she comes back around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when my internet cuts off and starts slowing down. It bugs me out so much, maybe it's time to upgrade ISP. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I am with you on that. Mine has been doing that all week. It's so annoying and it costs even more to switch to someone else <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling nostalgic while I was packing away baby clothes earlier. I guess I'm getting soft. <endOfText>
<human> Every adult has some nostalgic feelings of becoming a child again. Adult responsibilities are overwhelming <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a final exam for my Economics class tomorrow. I had been studying the whole past week and am ready to ace it <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! Hard work always pays off.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good luck! Hard work always pays off. <endOfText>
<human> Indeed. Besides, hard work boosts your confidence and make you more to believe in yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am optimistic about my health. I've gained a little weight but I think with some motivation and consistency, I can lose it all. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What strategies are you using? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure the democrats will win in November. <endOfText>
<human> That's probably true, but who knows in this country. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our family has been a little down lately because our grandmother recently passed away <endOfText>
<human> Awe I am so sorry to hear that.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, have you ever been to the mountains? <endOfText>
<human> LOVE the mountains. Mainly in the New Mexico / Colorado area -- but also to the Alps. How about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to book a holiday to Europe, but the flight prices have doubled. <endOfText>
<human> That is such a bummer. Summer is an expensive time to travel. I went to Ireland in July but I bought the tickets in March so they were pretty cheap.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is such a bummer. Summer is an expensive time to travel. I went to Ireland in July but I bought the tickets in March so they were pretty cheap. <endOfText>
<human> We were shooting for a fall trip, but it's looking like it won't happen now.  I guess I waited an hour too long to hit the confirm button <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I booked a surprise anniversary trip and I can't wait to tell my spouse, but she might be mad because she doesn't like surprises. <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting!  I can't imagine getting upset over a surprise trip though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm the same-I'd just be excited! She likes to always know what's going on. I think I'll drive her to the airport and then tell her. <endOfText>
<human> I would be thrilled!  I think it's a great idea <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I participate in crossfit competitions. I have been training hard and feel really good about my ability to place. <endOfText>
<human> That's probably great for your body and fitness. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad because I took what was my daddy's rolex watch without his permission <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. For fun or you needed it for something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog decided to take a break from potty training and go all over my house while I was at work. Little devil <endOfText>
<human> well, something must have gone wrong somehow, I think you should talk to your vet doctor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a storm last night and a tree fell onto my roof. I think I need to get the roof re-shingled and I am lost for words... <endOfText>
<human> oh that was so sad.don't fed up.you have to go through this problem <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> last day ,in my office my chief scolded me very rustic way for the unnecessary reason.it was so irrirtating <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a friend whos life was going down hill with drugs, he threw himself in rehab got his first job , within a few months got asked to be manager i was awe at all of this <endOfText>
<human> That is absolutely amazing. That could be an inspiration to so many different people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Drugs are bad, but he was homeless for a bit as well , its beautiful how things can change so dramatically <endOfText>
<human> You know that almost sounds like that could be a movie. There are so many people caught up with drugs today in the United States and around the world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, something terrible just happened to me! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm so sorry! Do you want to talk about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always try to put myself before my dogs. I love them so much! <endOfText>
<human> I love them too. What kind of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a Husky and a maltese Shiz Tzu. They are my little babies! <endOfText>
<human> Awww, I bet they are. I don't have a dog right now but I want one. I just don't know what breed yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad! I was supposed to start my vacation on Monday and my boss is making come into work! I can't believe he would do that! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is messed up. Why did your boss change mind so suddenly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been single for some time now. I am alone and sooo sad. <endOfText>
<human> Try to put yourself out there!  You can also try online dating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have spent alot of effort grooming my daughter to be a smart girl, she did well last semester with straight As and I am very proud of her <endOfText>
<human> woow that is good of her. encourage her to keep shinning <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cried a lot but i had to let it go <endOfText>
<human> wow, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, I like to go to church and pray. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. The community aspect of church is fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate presenting a project in front of my class. It's so nerve-racking. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you.I am that way to.I fear public speaking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my old house in Orlando <endOfText>
<human> ok, where do you live now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really choked up last night looking at old photo albums.  The "days gone by" really made me nostalgic. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes revisiting the past is great for personal reflection. Maybe contact those people sometime. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I became friends with a girl in college. I was jealous of the men she dated, especially as she told me she would have dated me if we weren't friends. <endOfText>
<human> Thats unfortunate. Sometimes, people don't know how to make a move and are waiting for you to make a move. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a job interview and I think I nailed it. I left there feeling very confident. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, that is a situation where confidence is very helpful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole an ice chest out of the back of my truck <endOfText>
<human> What's an ice chest?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What's an ice chest? <endOfText>
<human> Its a insulated box for storing cold goods. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate seeing my best friend depressed. I've seen them so happy in life but seeing them like this now makes me feel unhappy. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to cheer them up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> whats is your opinon on situation like this? <endOfText>
<human> On what situation?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On what situation? <endOfText>
<human> "I don't like doing my job and the duties of other co-worker that slack.". <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have 2 working arms and legs. I am so thankful for not being handicapped in life. <endOfText>
<human> I'm grateful for my limbs as well, this the reason I'm a hard worker. I appreciate what god gave me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I found a kitten last week! <endOfText>
<human> That is so amazing! Do you love cats as much as I love dogs, Ha! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on my way to an interview the other day and was overly anxious. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, those are never fun. But they usually end up being better than you expect.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, those are never fun. But they usually end up being better than you expect. <endOfText>
<human> That's so true, it ended up going over very well. I had no reason to be nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend learned to speak another language (quite fluently) in 3 months <endOfText>
<human> That's honestly really amazing, most people take forever to learn even a tiny bit of a foreign language. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week was my birthday. I thought everyone forgot about it because no one wished me a happy birthday at work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's awful. Did you mention it to anyone?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that's awful. Did you mention it to anyone? <endOfText>
<human> No but in the afternoon I noticed everyone was disappearing. Then all of a sudden I heard them singing Happy Birthday to me. I was so surprised! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a blue wave coming in november. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate being single! It makes me so bitter seeing happy couples everywhere. I'm so sad... <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.Have you try dating APPS <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor died in a car crash." <endOfText>
<human> Oh my.  I'm so sorry to hear that.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The news gets me so upset.  I just heard about a mother murdering her 4 year old daughter.  I'm so disgusted right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awful. Some people have serious mental problems. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to ride out a hurricane in my home. It was one of the scariest experiences ever. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, it must have been so scary! Do you live in an area commonly affected by hurricaines? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was your home damaged? Was anyone hurt in your area? I've never seen a hurricaine, except on the news. <endOfText>
<human> I had a downed tree and roof damage, no one died around here but lots of homes were lost. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a crazy week with 4 big events and I'm so happy to be at home relaxing in the air conditioning today. My dogs are happy too! <endOfText>
<human> Air conditioning is very nice. My dogs love the outdoors but they want AC after a good, long walk! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's very hot here today, and also a long weekend, so a little down time is nice. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is very hot and humid where I am. Always makes a good excuse to kick back in a nice, cool house! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry my co-worker stole from me yesterday. How could they do this to me... <endOfText>
<human> What was it that they stole from you there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to the music concert this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What music concert? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a motivational speaker at my office a couple weeks ago. His speech really resonated with me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, what was the subject of the sppech?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, what was the subject of the sppech? <endOfText>
<human> The speech was on the importance of teamwork and being positive! It was really inspiring! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing nice cars on the road inspires me. I bet they worked very hard to get those cars! <endOfText>
<human> cars are truly inspiring to see how theyve evolved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but seeing the hard work the people who own them had to put in is the most impressive part. <endOfText>
<human> it's important to take care of and maintain things you own. if properly maintained they can last for a long time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a dream that i was with my brother hanging out having a great time. when i woke up i was so bummed it was only a dream. <endOfText>
<human> Lol, happens to me all the time. I love those types of dreams and it sucks when they end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, guess what just happened that made me cry. <endOfText>
<human> What's that? Hope it wasn't too bad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While getting into my car after shopping, I realized I had walked out without paying for the flash drive I had picked up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you return to the store and pay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so scared for my sister's health. She is in the hospital and I hope she doesn't have cancer. <endOfText>
<human> Have they already done a biopsy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate being in public by myself. It gets me super nervous and I turn bright red. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that must be so stressful. Does it happen all the time - like even at the grocery store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my coworkers had a get together after work and never even invited me <endOfText>
<human> Wow that must have stung! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a nice day so I decided to walk to work recently. I was feeling great until I heard a loud squishy noise. <endOfText>
<human> Don't tell me you stepped in dog poop. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter got into an Ivy league school after high school. I am so happy for her! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so happy and proud! Is she going to have to move far away to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my wife is pregnant today! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would like to go vegan, but anytime I try a vegan dish, I REALLY dislike it. Like, stomach turning dislike. <endOfText>
<human> It really limits your dietary choices.  I don't recommend it.   Have you considered vegetarian? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a doctor's appointment last week and had to wait over an hour to see him. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were very annoyed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I shop online for computer parts, I like to use newegg because I am confident their items will ship fast and on time. <endOfText>
<human> I have never used newegg before, and I think that sounds like that are very good at what they do. I might have to check them out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few days ago my friends threw a party for me <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I got into an argument a few days before my birthday party about catering options. <endOfText>
<human> Oh? Big fight or one of those little fights? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Big fight. These kinds of things--picking out foods--make me very frustrated because I have ADHD/Aspergers. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I see. Well I hope it at least got worked out for you guys <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching olympic figure skating on TV the other day. I was so amazed at how graceful they were. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you. That sport is very majestic and can be considered any art form <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have a car anymore but I am content with that. Everything I need is within walking distance so whatever. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's good to hear. Some people's lives depend on their vehicles and it would be a lot worse on them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My afternoon was very relaxing. I sat outside in the nice weather and watched my kids play in the yard. <endOfText>
<human> I'm jealous of you! I find it hard to wind down sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old iPod in my drawers this morning. The memories I had with this thing hit me hard. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I have had that happen before.  What type of memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke the headlight on my truck. <endOfText>
<human> On purpose or accident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's messed up. Do you know who did it? <endOfText>
<human> No clue, I walked out side this morning and found it broken. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at a restaurant this morning and their bathroom was beyond gross. It was weird because the eating area was squeaky clean but their bathroom was the opposite. <endOfText>
<human> That's disgusting.  Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke and ran into my mailbox this morning. I can't believe they didn't even leave a note... <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's crappy. Is it totaled or fixable?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that's crappy. Is it totaled or fixable? <endOfText>
<human> It is totaled. I have to get a whole new mailbox and I am furious! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my job interview in a couple days. I have everything I need from attire to answers to questions! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like you should get the job for sure! Your competition doesn't stand a chance!! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was raped. I have just gone for a test to know if I am pregnant or I caught a disease from the bad experience <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I am so sorry this happened to you. What an animal! When will you know the results of your tests? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its ok , I am so anxious about my status <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully the medical personnel will understand your predicament and your worry and will expedite the results. Until then, do you have someone you can confide in or just talk to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the end of the year, a good friend of mine who I haven't seen in a while is coming down to visit. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting. How long has it been since you've seen eachother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I purchased my first new vehicle yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That must be very exciting! I hope to get a new vehicle soon as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my house today with a shirt that had a hole in it. I didn't notice until a stranger pointed it out and I was so ashamed! <endOfText>
<human> oh, that's okay. I'm sure no one else really noticed it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i started off planting season with a few small seedlings and some plants from seed. i was anticipating the growth of my plants <endOfText>
<human> Did the plants grow up to be big and strong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost had a crash today! <endOfText>
<human> oh no. that can be nerve wracking. are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found albums of old pictures in my attic when I was a little kid. I miss the old days when I had no responsibilities! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I heard that before. You must have a twin running around here! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was young I loved to spit off of my 10th floor balcony. One day I spit and a lady happened to be walking by at the wrong time. <endOfText>
<human> Hahahah, that is hilarious. I used to do that but with coins and stuff. I miss being a little ruthless, careless kid! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was offered a higher paying position at my job, but I'm not sure if I'll accept it due to the added stress. <endOfText>
<human> If I were you I would accept it because no amount of stress could stop me from making more money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought new flavor of coffee today from Starbucks. I was so shocked at how bad it was. I'm never going to try a new coffee flavor. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's never fun. You think you're going to discover a new favorite and then....blech! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset when I lost my wallet last week. I looked all over for it and could not find it anywhere. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didn't lose too much money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been to the doctor in ages and I need to take a physical soon. I feel great though, so I think it'll turn out well! <endOfText>
<human> That is a good attitude. You shouldn't have anything to worry about. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, Are you afraid of the snakes? <endOfText>
<human> Yes I am terrified!  We have venemous ones in my backyard - water moccs! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a guy I liked and my friend knew it but she set him up with our other friend instead! <endOfText>
<human> What a mean friend person. Did you get mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a couple of loved ones last year and I can't get it off my mind. <endOfText>
<human> Have you thought about speaking with a counselor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you like to drink the coffee drinks? <endOfText>
<human> I love coffee, actually. I drink a few cups every morning! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was such a relief that I knew the work they were doing in school. <endOfText>
<human> What type of work are they doing at school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my results back from my doctor and I am so scared. I think I might have cancer... <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, I am so sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I played a video game last night that I hadn't played since the 90's. Brought back so many memories. <endOfText>
<human> I love that feeling of nostalgia. It's an amazing feeling, it's like reliving the past. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend let me borrow their car for the weekend. I feel like our relationship is on another level! <endOfText>
<human> Well that is very nice. How long have you guys been friends for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, how is your day going today? <endOfText>
<human> It's been mediocre, how about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other night I was having this dream where I felt like I was getting rained on. It was a really weird feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Did the dream feel like it was really happening? Strange indeed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning I ran over my neighbors mail box. When getting home later that afternoon I noticed it was back up. I hope he doesn't know it was me! <endOfText>
<human> Oops. Well it happens. You better hope they don't have a camera haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having a baby! I will learn the gender today! <endOfText>
<human> Wow wow wow! That is wonderful and exciting! Congratulations!!!!! Do you have any vibes as to gender, one way or the other? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Visiting Disneyland recently made me feel extremely nostalgic. <endOfText>
<human> I love Disneyland! It's a very special place filled with great memories and you are never old for that place <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot the make my credit card payment yesterday. I feel so bad because I told myself all day yesterday not to forget. <endOfText>
<human> Was the due date yesterday?  Is the payment late now?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was the due date yesterday?  Is the payment late now? <endOfText>
<human> I think so. I am feel so guilty because the interest was so avoidable. I forget so many things all the time... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was amazing seeing my mother graduate today! <endOfText>
<human> Graduate from school? I bet you are very proud of her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got on a roller coaster yesterday and I ended up puking everywhere! I just wanted to disappear! <endOfText>
<human> Lol, I bet you were disgusted with yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an Imagine Dragons concert this weekend and it was awesome! I don't regret going at all. <endOfText>
<human> I actually just discovered Imagine Dragons. I love them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I helped one of my close friends lose over 60 pounds last year. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you are a true friend. What did you do to help them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy for my dad. He finally paid off his student debt loans after all these years. I can see a change in his demeanor and I feel so ecstatic for him! <endOfText>
<human> I bet that is so relieving! It sucks how much debt you need to take on in order to go to school these days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am angry  with my mother for not telling me who my father is <endOfText>
<human> Did you find out who your father is yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just won something from calling into the radio channel! <endOfText>
<human> that's amazing I have never been that lucky before <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just heard there was an earthquake in Indonesia. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Any idea how strong it was? Any casualties? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss screwed up on his work and told HIS boss that it as me! <endOfText>
<human> Argh! That is the worst. I am so sorry. Is it enough to inspire you to look for work elsewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ok.. So I will admit it. I pee'd my pants the other day. At work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear. Well, that does happen. Did you have any other clothes to change into? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview yesterday, I'm confident I got the job. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, I would wait until I heard back before I would celebrate getting the job.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for you, I would wait until I heard back before I would celebrate getting the job. <endOfText>
<human> That's a very good point! But still, doesn't hurt to hope. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I took a picture of myself at a battlefield and there was a ghostly smudge over me that wasn't in the image before or after it. <endOfText>
<human> That's extremely unsettling. How did you feel when you saw the photo with that in it for the first time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I bought a croissant inn the bakery and when I paid they gave me the wrong change. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats annoying.  but I hope they gave you more than you were supposed to get back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling so alone lately :( <endOfText>
<human> Why is that so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I was tired because I was up all night studying. I guess I was very clumsy that day. <endOfText>
<human> What happened from your clumsiness? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy that I have graduated today! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's exciting! Congratulations, you must be very proud.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, that's exciting! Congratulations, you must be very proud. <endOfText>
<human> I am very proud. And I will celebrate by going to Disney Land! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy for all the presents that I got at my birthday party! <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. Did you have a party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was my one day to sleep in, and I got woken up early by the construction workers making noise early this morning <endOfText>
<human> Gee, that's no fun. I hope it wasn't too early? There are usually laws about making noise early in the morning. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I see this guys at the skate park do a really cool 360 trick on the half pipe last week! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds awesome.  I always wanted to be able to do that, but I was never any good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugghhh!  My neighbor's dog has gone to the bathroom in my yard again!! <endOfText>
<human> I have four dogs.  I am probably guilty of this crime.  I would just throw it back over. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having a nice afternoon on my computer here, having some nice chats with people. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so wonderful.  I am having a similarly relaxing day too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work with high school dropouts. One of my students went above and beyond to complete their last course and finish high school. It was very inspiring. He even invited me to his graduation! <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up going to the graduation! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Always embarrassing to fall off my dirtbike! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! did you hurt yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh dear, sounds like a serious accident. I'm glad you are okay! Could have been terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Very thankful that it wasn't worse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, do you like feeding ducks or other birds? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, ducks are so cute. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need some advice on if I should say something <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? I'd be happy to help. But say something about what exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On my way to work today, some guy just cut me off in his car. Can you believe that? <endOfText>
<human> Wow, some people are horrible drivers.  Did you honk at him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a departmental meeting at work recently that made me feel really anxious.  We're trying to figure out who our new department head should be. <endOfText>
<human> I think you will be fine. Don't feel too anxious worrying won't do anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a proud  father of 3 lovely girls <endOfText>
<human> Really sorry to be slow to respond.  How old are your girls?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put my dog in dog classes so he would learn to behave. He didn't like it at first but started to make progress. <endOfText>
<human> What type of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a crush on this person, and I dont know if they like me, and I don't want to ask and be rejected. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it's probably for the best. You don't want to risk rejection. Maybe they will approach you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Love isn’t fair sometimes.  You know what I mean? <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I know for sure. There are no rules to follow.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This girl at work and I have perfect chemistry and we always seem to hit it off.  Well I just found out that she has a boyfriend.  So not fair. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh. Maybe you can wait out that relationshio. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I know for sure. There are no rules to follow. <endOfText>
<human> This girl at work and I have perfect chemistry and we always seem to hit it off.  Well I just found out that she has a boyfriend.  So not fair.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I realized this morning when I was waiting for the bus that I forgot to bring any change. Someone ended up paying for my bus ride! <endOfText>
<human> Well that is very lucky for you. People are nice! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I was very happy about it. There are still nice people in this world. <endOfText>
<human> Yes there are. Most of the people are very nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite shoe today! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did that happen?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! How did that happen? <endOfText>
<human> I don't know. But now I am upset because I wasn't able to make it to my favorite gym! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to be late for gym practice. But my friend helped me to find my missing shoe. Now I will be on time! <endOfText>
<human> Hey, that's awesome! I'm happy for you. Where did they find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend needed a car this weekend, so I let her use my new car. <endOfText>
<human> Well that is very nice of you. Is your friend a good driver? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It went so much better than expected, she loves me back! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is awesome. What kind of animal is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I baked a batch of cookies for my kid's birthday party. The only problem was I couldn't resist eating a few before the party. They were so good. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of cookies did you bake? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe they cut me from that team. <endOfText>
<human> What What???  What team?  Who cut you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy. I met this really hot guy on Live Chat. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Tell me about him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a new born who is only 6 months old. He just started to talk, or make funny sounds at least! <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool!  Is it your first baby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is, I'm a very happy dad. He's going to be so smart. <endOfText>
<human> I bet.  If he is anything like you he will grow up to be a great person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have really been shocked at how cool some of the people I have met on the internet are. <endOfText>
<human> Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to talk to them a bit.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Most people are pretty cool if you take the time to talk to them a bit. <endOfText>
<human> I met a psychic healer in a chat room.  He said he could heal people from anywhere in the world. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had booked a trip to Paris for me and my spouse but she fell and broke her leg about 6 weeks before we were supposed to go. We had to postpone for 6 months. <endOfText>
<human> Did you guys get to go? Is the leg all fixed now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We did go. It was for my 40th birthday a few years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Are you planning a new trip for your upcoming birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to watch my kid get the degree soon! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's so exciting! What did they study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going back to school this semester and decided to get everything ready well in advance. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. Being prepared is half the work of academia.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for you. Being prepared is half the work of academia. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I try to stay as organized as possible. It helps stay on top of things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ok, don’t judge me, but this is going to sound silly but i cried watching a movie the other day <endOfText>
<human> There is nothing silly about that.  Movies are meant to illicit emotion.  You feel better now though, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my cousin passed away after his battle with colon cancer. He was only 27. I am so upset! <endOfText>
<human> I am not sure how to deal with the loss! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pilot certification test is coming up next week. I am so nervous I won't remember all the answers. I will be devastated if I flunk the test. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, there's a lot of strategies to fight that thought, I'm assuming. As they say an ounce of preparation is worth more than a pound of cure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker just got selected to enroll in a leadership class offered by my work. I also applied but didn't get selected. I really wish I was in his shoes righyt now! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that's too bad, sorry to hear that. Do you know why you didn't get picked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 11 year old cat died this morning... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  I am so sorry to hear that.  Did he die of old age? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey this guy who lives with me wasn't doing his scheduled work, and I had to talk to him about it.. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes you have to put people in their place. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog has been having health issues. I took him to the vet and they couldn't find anything wrong. <endOfText>
<human> oh now, that's very worrisome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so aggravated today while I was installing a new light fixture in my dining room!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you eventually get it working after the frustration? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have enough money to pay my rent this month so I took the money from the cash at work. I feel terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, maybe you should have bought a lottery ticket instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always play the lotto, but I got a good feeling about tonight! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah! Did you pick your lucky numbers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I cleaned my house when my kids were off at summer camp. I was so glad I got it done. <endOfText>
<human> That is so satisfying. I hope they don't mess it up now that they are home! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling so sentimental while looking through old photos of my kids today. They grow up too fast! <endOfText>
<human> Aw, my mom had some she showed to us a few years back. It's weird to consider how you and everyone else have grown! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a two week vacation coming up in Greece that I've been looking forward to! <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you for being excited! What are you going to see on your trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love looking after my grandma! She is 94 and it makes me feel good to help her in any way I can! <endOfText>
<human> That is absolutely wonderful! What a great grandchild you are. Not everyone wants to care for elderly relatives. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She deserves it for everything she has done throughout her life. <endOfText>
<human> For sure. We sometimes forget that the elderly were young once and did so much like working, raising and caring for their families. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching the World Cup on TV recently. I was so amazed at how good those players are. <endOfText>
<human> Do you play soccer yourself?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you play soccer yourself? <endOfText>
<human> I have only played a couple times. It is impressive how much energy they have and how good their accuracy is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to my home town today. Will be visiting for my brother's graduation! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations to your brother! Are you flying or driving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working a great new job the past month and can finally afford a nice apartment. I feel great. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear. Summer is a good time of year to be enjoying your life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember one time when I was little I was running around in the basement when I wasn't supposed to be. <endOfText>
<human> Gee that sounds fun, but did you get in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was pouring down rain when i got home so i grabbed all my stuff and got ready for a break in the rain so i could get in the house without getting soaked. <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to avoid the rain?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Were you able to avoid the rain? <endOfText>
<human> yes thankfully i was able to get in the house without rain falling on me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the new Jurassic Park movie the other day. It was such a let down for me. <endOfText>
<human> i remember being a kid when the first one came out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I cross a major street I am always worry about getting hit by a car. I try to be careful and only cross at the crosswalk but I am still nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Those are good preventative measures. I assume that you always look both ways as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I try and visit my grandmother every weekend. She's getting old and I'm not sure how much time she has left. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so nice of you!  I wish I had a grandmother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my girlfriend in awhile. She told me today she was coming to visit me! <endOfText>
<human> Long distance relationships aren't easy. That's great news to hear. Do you have anything special planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling hungry a little while ago until I thought back on that time I ordered a submarine sandwich and had the grossest experience. <endOfText>
<human> What was the gross part about the sandwich? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was trimming dead leaves off of my tomato plants and ended up getting swarmed by mosquitos. <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. I bet you will wear bug spray next time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't complain about anything right now. I have a roof over my head, a decent job, and a wonderful family. <endOfText>
<human> i am also blessed. we don't have fancy things or a ton of money but we have each other and our health. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, have you ever eaten a sandwich with hard bread? <endOfText>
<human> I like a good hard bread like Pumpernickel. Do you know what that word means? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the baseball game sitting in the outfield. I heard a loud crack from the batter. <endOfText>
<human> Did the batter hit one of the home runs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a little scared. I found out my neighbor is a satan worshiper. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that's extreme. Can you say some prayers for them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whoa, that's extreme. Can you say some prayers for them? <endOfText>
<human> Well I am not christian, and in a way.. who am I to knock someone else for theirs <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has a new yoga instructor names Mark. He is such good shape, I feel a bit weird about her going to his classes. <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry bout that.  She has to have some sort of fantasy in her life.  Don't you have any ever? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In a few weeks my best friend and I are going to go see Ben Folds, I can't wait. <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting. Have you been a fan a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a test today and was very nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really miss my family. we are 800 miles away from each other. <endOfText>
<human> Did you make any plans to go and visit them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love seeing halloween commercials before october hits , it makes me feel like a kid again <endOfText>
<human> Ohh, I love Halloween! It is my favorite time of the year. I can't wait! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a lottery ticket a few days ago. I felt so confident it was going to win the jackpot! <endOfText>
<human> well did you ? the most i ever won was like 20 bux lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting for this storm to approach <endOfText>
<human> Is there any warnings? How much rain are you expecting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday my hamster passed away. He was barely two years old :(. <endOfText>
<human> What was your hamster's name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to church and everything this week. Maybe I will be blessed in my career! <endOfText>
<human> I hope that does good things for you. They say if you believe in something enough it comes true. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i found an old pyrex bowl at the store yesterday like the one my mom used to make tuna casserole in. <endOfText>
<human> Did that bring back a lot of memories? It sounds like you made a good find there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a bunker in my back yard with a ton of food in case of a natural disaster. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds delightful. I have a tornado approaching now and would like it if you lived near me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The storm is coming, I can hear it with my ears! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope you are ready for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got so irritated when I was driving the other day! <endOfText>
<human> I hope nobody was trying to cut you off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my spouse walked out on me and my kids I was so glad to have my friends. They brought me food and babysat for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awful! How many kids do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a special present last year! <endOfText>
<human> ooooh what was it , and how did it make you feel ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a new restaurant last friday and they asked what sauce i would like my food to be cooked with , i said give me the spice dragon thinking it was gonna be hot , it was sweet and tangy i only ate a bit and left the rest there <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's disappointing!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, that's disappointing! <endOfText>
<human> it really was , i really dont like sweet food at all, i cant even stand candy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just won the lotto and now I can finally finish my storm shelter! I will finally be safe from all these twisters! <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's a good plan, hope you remember to include some fun stuff for those long house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a little bit of weight recently and last week I felt more confident in a bathing suit. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How much did you lose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the most amazing time the other night and I am so happy and I feel like I'm on cloud 9. <endOfText>
<human> Please tell me what happened! I wish I did too!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss when I was a child. I didn't have to do anything besides school and play with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> yes those were the days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving along and had a car accident today.. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good, are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a person at a bar recently who said they were a movie star. I believed him because I didn't know any better. <endOfText>
<human> So did you find out that they were lying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a new storm shelter and food. But I didn't get anything to play with for the storm. <endOfText>
<human> You need something to pass the time or you will go crazy with boredom. How about some books or cards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got home from work and I cannot even begin to tell you how mad I am right now! <endOfText>
<human> What a day, huh?! Can you tell me what happened or is it still too raw? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so alone! I'm a single mom and my son just went off to college. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's a bummer. Well at least you can look forward to his visits. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been looking for a mate for such a long time. I want to find a single mother with an empty nest. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it's hard to find that certain someone! Have you tried a dating app? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just made a new friend. <endOfText>
<human> really? How did you meet them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whoa! so that was crazy.  You'll never guess what just happened. <endOfText>
<human> Did you win that lottery?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devastated when my pet turtle died. Me and Petey were best friends. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that, were you thinking of buying another one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephews came over a few days ago and it reminded me of my childhood <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What specifically did it remind you of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so gratified and rewarded right now.  It feels like it was all worth it <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What made you feel rewarded? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating at my favorite Chinese restaurant recently. During one bite I felt a crunch in my mouth. <endOfText>
<human> That's gross. What was it?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago I saw the cutest puppy at the pound. I brought him home to my son. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I love puppies. Did your son love him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so pleased with myself for knocking off a lot of tasks in my home remodeling project! <endOfText>
<human> that's awesome! what rooms did you remodel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After 2 months of working out I'm finally losing weight and hopeful it's all worth it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  we're you so fat before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that's huge.  U actually worked on yourself.  So,  how did you do it? <endOfText>
<human> I joined a gym and work out 5 days a week. I also started eating healthy... and I wouldn't say "huge"@ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's been awhile now, but I vividly remember being let go from my job where I'd worked (and sweated and bled) for 11 years.  They claimed it was due to downsizing. <endOfText>
<human> That's really hard!  I'm sure that was disappointing after putting in so many years.  Sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having to cancel my Labor Day plans since I have to work.  My boss is taking a trip and we both can't be gone from work.  I'm disappointed. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks!  What were your plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so ashamed of my self the other day! I went to work with two different shoes! <endOfText>
<human> What was the reason that happen to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very glad with my new job <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Where are you working for your new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend wrecked my car when I let him borrow it over the weekend <endOfText>
<human> That is a real bummer. I hope your friend gets it repaired for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it really annoys me at work that i work so hard , and then slackers get paid the same amount kinda makes me feel invious, like they just get to walk around and get payed for it <endOfText>
<human> I totally know the feeling! Have you tried bringing this up to your supervisor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes i have many times, but they do nothing about it sometimes it just makes want to quit so they are stuck with all the bad workers <endOfText>
<human> Ha, that would be some pretty good revenge. Maybe you should go ahead and find a new job where you will be appreciated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in some dog poop walking in my neighborhood the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That's disgusting, I would have a very hard time finishing that walk. Did you go straight home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to tell you about one of the scariest moments ive had in a long time.. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we went on vacation last year, I rode tower of terror. I screamed my head off the entire time. <endOfText>
<human> That's at MGM right?  My daughter rode that with her daddy when she was 8, she was terrified!  Did you do it again, or was once enough? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We did a behind the scenes tour at a local zoo with our daughters and the otters had just had babies! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! What other animals did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved out of my dad's house when I was 19 and moved to Atlanta. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty impressive! Was it scary to move away from home at such a young age? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so thankful that my friend came to pick me up when my car broke down yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> I absolutely hate car trouble! It is the worst!  Thankful for friends that can help out in times like that - did you get it fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog started to get lumps along her stomach so I'm taking her o the vet tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope she is OK! Glad you are taking her to the vet. Is she doing OK other than the lumps? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I am headed to Mexico for work in about 2 weeks and I am a bit nervous.  I have never been and I am not sure what to expect. <endOfText>
<human> I think that it's completely normal to feel that way for such a long distance trip. I assume you're going from America. I bet you would feel better by doing a bit of research! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work in a position with a few other coworkers in the same position. One, who does little work, recently got a promotion. He was even there less time than me. <endOfText>
<human> That would drive me crazy.  How are you handling it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our daughters are growing up so fast on us. They are now 18 and almost 16.  I think you blink and the years just fly by. <endOfText>
<human> Yes i agree.  I have 3 boys and they are in their twenties. I don't know where the years went. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish that when people say they are going to do something or make a promise, that they would stick to it. <endOfText>
<human> I know exactly what you mean. I have been let down many times, and it's never a good feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an important job interview coming up this week <endOfText>
<human> That's so exciting! Are you feeling nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I waited for two weeks for my final grades. It seemed to take forever to get them. I couldn't stand it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were a nervous wreck. I hope they turned out well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest daughter was in a running club at her school, and she won her very first race. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! How far did she have to run? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My step father passed away last year and my mother moved in with my sister.  She didn't raise me, so it works out that she's living with my sister. <endOfText>
<human> Do she at least try to keep in contact with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I opened up my fridge and was shocked to see it was completely empty. <endOfText>
<human> That is too funny. Sometimes life can get so busy that you can lose track of things like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i walked into a church one day and there was a private baptism going on. i was so ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Was there no sign posted or anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling pretty good after finishing that last exam. <endOfText>
<human> that's great. when will you know how you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our daughter's dance program sent out new tuition notices.  They've decided to change the pay structure and everything at the last minute! <endOfText>
<human> That's so mean! I think they should honor the original prices they set <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog decided to pee on my bed when I wasn't home. Little jerk. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  And that is hard to get out!  Do you have a waterproof cover on the bed by any chance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am blushing so bad right now, sometimes technology is not my friend. <endOfText>
<human> I can relate.  Sometimes I have issues with new tech.  What is giving you problems? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend won a work contest that we were competing for.  He gets an all expenses trip to St. Louis for a weekend.  I love that town and I wish I was him <endOfText>
<human> Thats really awesome.  I never win anything cool.  Does he get to bring anyone? Maybe he can take you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I imagine he will take his wife.  He was kind of rubbing it in a bit at work.  I think he was trying to make me even more envious. <endOfText>
<human> Thats kind of mean of him.  Tell your boss that he cheated and that you should've won instead.  That'll teach him not to brag <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife surprised me once with a cruise to the Caribbean. I had no idea she was going to give that to me. <endOfText>
<human> that is a fun surprise. what part of the Caribbean did you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dog got loose and got in a fight with another dog. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that really stinks. Were either of them injured? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from work to discover that my cat had knocked down the TV <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Cats can be devious things when we are not home - and sometimes when we are.  Did it break the TV? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'd never had a new car, always used.  And when I say used, I mean 1973 VW Bug, no heat, no air, in Atlanta traffic.  That was until I got married. <endOfText>
<human> Well hello fellow Atlanta person. I also buy used, but most people tend to look down on it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i grew up playing video games all my life, every time i go to a laundermat or just happen to come across an old arcade at a bar it brings back good memories <endOfText>
<human> I remember those good times too, playing video games is a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get my foot checked out at the doctor recently. <endOfText>
<human> ooooh what happened , are you ok ? anything serious ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped on a snake in our backyard. I screamed so loud! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of snake was it? You know my mom is terrified of all snakes even the ones that aren't poisonous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do not like doctors.  I hate going, I am freaked out by surgery, etc.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? What makes you not like them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a new puppy and I got to play with it for a while, it was a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<human> Puppies are the best! If they don't destroy all of your belongings that is!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family loves to argue when we get together. It is annoying when we are in a restaurant and won't stop bickering. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet that is embarrassing for you when you guys are out in public. <endOfText>
<human> You are right. Sometimes I want to be invisible. I wish we would all just get along. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving home from work last night and some guy on his phone started coming into my lane.  I honked and he turned and flipped me off!  The nerve on that guy! <endOfText>
<human> I hate rude drivers like that. I swear they should not be able to drive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Part of me wanted to follow him and give him a piece of my mind, but thankfully cooler heads prevailed. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that would not have ended well. I usually take a picture of their license plate and publicly shame them on social media haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, yesterday I forgot I had a test and spent the entire day worrying about it while trying to study. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did you end up doingf? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not too sure to be honest, I reviewed as much as I could, but I'm still worried about the results. <endOfText>
<human> What subject was the test in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went to Mississippi a few weeks ago I was super prepared for the entire trip. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That must've been really fun, I've never been there actually, what did you guys do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cool cool, when do you think it would be best to visit Mississippi? <endOfText>
<human> Probably the summertime.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a bit left out since I moved to a new country. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry. Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the other day for the first time i watched the movie logan , the whole thing was very depressing this strong super hero now driving a old limo in mexico , and hes falling apart jeez <endOfText>
<human> I really liked Logan. It was a different kind of superhero movie. More about the struggle than anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> please dont laugh, but i actually cried at the end i could not stop the water works <endOfText>
<human> The scene with his daughter was pretty sad. I don't blame you at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you watched 2018 fifa world cup final? <endOfText>
<human> No I haven't, I'm not interested in soccer. Why, did I miss something good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a bit shocked since I found out my boss is getting married. <endOfText>
<human> Did he not seem like the type to do that kind of thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I won a lot of money in a lottery, but I was just reading the ticket wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, that is a bit of a false alarm/bummer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was watching alpine skiing on TV. I am amazed at their skills. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I love watching them ski during the Olympics. It takes a lot of hard work.  Have you ever skied? <endOfText>
<human> I did when I was a lot younger. I bet they train very hard. They make it look easy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a while back when my girl friend left me  i was a little bummed out about it for a while , everything was different for me <endOfText>
<human> That's not cool, I hope you find someone new. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah me too thank you for that , i feel a whole lot better now after time passed - time for the most all heals all <endOfText>
<human> This is true. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have a scheduled c-section with my 2nd child.  But it didn't exactly go as planned. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope it at least turned out ok <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in the running for a new job I want to get! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting!  Do you know when they will make a final decision? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On the road that's the only access to our neighborhood there was a dead animal that the city was notified of. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross, what kind of animal was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life was so good during my childhood. I lived carefree and oblivious to challenges. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you there.  I miss getting to just play without a care in the world.  Summer vacations were the best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its amazing how you can change emotions so fast sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> For sure. I can go from 0 to 100 in no time at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel a little bummed out since starting my new job recently. <endOfText>
<human> how come? i thought new jobs were supposed to be exciting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very mad when France won the world cup! Have you seen the game? <endOfText>
<human> I didn't, sorry. I'm not really a soccer fan. Why were you mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i found an old pyrex at the store that was just like the one my mom used to have. <endOfText>
<human> Do you mean pyrex like the cooking material? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a loud bang late in the night recently and thought someone was trying to break in to my house. <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness. i would've freaked out. are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> there was this little boy that kept picking on my little niece one day my niece fought back, she got her tooth knocked out but im glad she finally defended her self <endOfText>
<human> aw poor thing. did she get in trouble with the school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been hearing some really strange noises coming from my basement. I am fearful it is a monster. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats kind of creepy.  what does the noise sound like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So one time I was running late for a flight, and to make things worse I was stuck in a long line to check my suitcase. It was finally my turn when this woman cut right in front of me. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! I hate when that happens. I had a similar situation happen over Christmas. Did you make your flight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I totally know that feeling. It seems that everyone thinks that their situation is more important that everyone else's. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, and who knows, maybe hers was, but you don't get anywhere by being rude to people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So today I was out to lunch and the waitress was being super nice to me and calling me sweetie and I thought she was being nice to me just to get a tip, but guess what happened <endOfText>
<human> Haha what happened? Did you get her number? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting on my friend to confirm our plans for tonight, but he's taking so long <endOfText>
<human> I wonder why? Maybe his busy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a medical check up coming soon and I am praying everything will be okay with it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I hope so too! Those can be quite scary especially if you're like me and you go once every 10 years or so <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband started doing online work. it caught me off guard <endOfText>
<human> ohh, but why did it surprise you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I often get irritated because of my sister. <endOfText>
<human> my sister's can be irritating as well. no one knows how to push your buttons like family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friends wife finally had there baby last week, i am so happy for my friend he finally got a boy <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow how exciting.  Have you been able to see the baby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are wanting to get a new vehicle this next year. We are trying to pay off bills to make it happen. <endOfText>
<human> I know how it is to try to pay off bills. What kind of vehicle do you want to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid trashed my entire bathroom this morning, was definitely not a good morning. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Is your day going better now at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my car was acting up and i was able to get a good deal at the car dealer to replace it <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Going to the car dealership is usually such a horrible experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, I was sitting alone at 3am last night with the lights off. Felt spooky <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine.  I hate being out alone at those kinds of hours.  I try to avoid it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when I graduated high school. I felt like I completed something <endOfText>
<human> Me too! It seems like such a huge accomplishment at the time, doesn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just graduated this spring and will be starting college in a couple of weeks. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are proud of him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was around 2003, and I invited my family to the Degree Ceremony. I felt succesful because it was not easy for me to be there. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! What was your degree in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that I will need to travel abroad at my work, and it really took me off guard. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that would be shocking if you weren't expecting it.  Did they tell you when you were hired that there was a possibility?  Where might you be going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That will be very different.  How do you feel about it?  I wish you lots of luck and adventure while you're there! <endOfText>
<human> I feel confident since I have been there before on holiday. Thank you very much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter, who is only 8, just landed her first triple back flip in gymnastics this week. I've never been able to do anything like that. It was amazing to watch. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is amazing indeed. You must be very proud of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am!  I was never the gymnast type but she has been bouncing off the walls and climbing and jumping since she was little.  I didn't know they could even do things like that so young. <endOfText>
<human> The human body truly is amazing. I could never do things like that either. Either way, I am happy for her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a bad spot when my dad died. I just felt lost <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry,  was it a sickness? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe my mother would go through my things! <endOfText>
<human> Why did she do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I wanted to cook something new for the first time, so I looked up this steak recipe and it went really well! <endOfText>
<human> congrats!  i love love love steak and to cook <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah! i'm just getting into it right now, could you recommend me some stuff to cook? <endOfText>
<human> i love to make shredded bbq chicken sandwich, get chicken breast seasone place in crack pot  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love to make shredded bbq chicken sandwich, get chicken breast seasone place in crack pot <endOfText>
<human> that sounds pretty good, I'll have to try that later! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend works 2 jobs to support her 3 kids <endOfText>
<human> thats a strong woman , i know of people that dont work at all a refuse to pay child support , in my eyes they are not men <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it finally rained today , and i know whats coming next mosquitos they litterally will eat you alive in texas <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Mosquitos. Have you heard about scientists trying to make them extinct? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I'm not doing to good, I had to put down my 13 year old dog <endOfText>
<human> That is so depressing. They say dogs are man's best friend.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so depressing. They say dogs are man's best friend. <endOfText>
<human> He was definitely mine, it's going to take a bit to get over him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have enough money for all of my grocery. When I was going to put some stuff back, the lady behind me offered to pay. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome. i hate that feeling when you need things but can't afford to get them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i feel bad for never having money to participate in work functions <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling. What do you tell your coworkers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend decided to lie about cheating with another girl when he was confronted with clear evidence <endOfText>
<human> Wow that must have been awkward.  You can't really argue with the evidence sitting right in front of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think after I pay off the mortgage, I'll be pretty happy in life. <endOfText>
<human> That would be awesome!  You would be in such a great situation in life with that payment gone!  What prompted you to want to do it?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be awesome!  You would be in such a great situation in life with that payment gone!  What prompted you to want to do it? <endOfText>
<human> You mean get the mortgage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I promised my sister that I would go sky diving with her when she was old enough to, but I didn't think she's remember. I'm horribly afraid of heights. <endOfText>
<human> How long ago was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey how's it going, finished college last May, Woot woot <endOfText>
<human> That is such a great milestone what is next for your ventures?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is such a great milestone what is next for your ventures? <endOfText>
<human> Right now, I'm sending in a bunch of resumes for jobs, no bites yet but i'm going to keep trucking <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my brother fell ill we had no idea he would go so quick. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I'm sorry. I hope he at least didn't suffer much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt study well before my exam and it was in two hours. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! For now, just do the best you can. Stress might cloud your thinking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was helping my mom repain the house, and it reminded me of when I used to ask her if I can help her paint when I was little. <endOfText>
<human> Did she paint art when you were a child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Met with my friend who I haven't seen in 4 years. Feels like we never left each other <endOfText>
<human> Isn't it amazing how true friendship stands the test of time and distance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I fell asleep and peed my pants in class <endOfText>
<human> wow thats hilarious and embarassing.  I feel bad for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was one of those days where I almost lost it on someone. <endOfText>
<human> Im glad you didn't.  Do you have these days often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I was sitting next to a kid and he threw up all over me <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a pretty disgusting situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I have a big meeting at work tomorrow, which always make me nervous no matter what. <endOfText>
<human> You will be great im sure of it! are you prepared?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You will be great im sure of it! are you prepared? <endOfText>
<human> Thank you! Yes, I think so. I will just have to overcome nerves and do my best I think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was completely ready for this upcoming game.  I will win. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What game is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Basketball.  My team is going to dominate <endOfText>
<human> What team are you rooting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new job and have been making enough to pay bills. Feels nice not to go add more debt <endOfText>
<human> The feeling of financial freedom is one that is hard to match. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was elated to see my army brother standing at the front door. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Surprise come home trip?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow! Surprise come home trip? <endOfText>
<human> Yes! I was so happy.  I gave him the biggest hug of his life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother is the sole reason I am where I am today. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, my grandmother was really there for me, too, I'm lucky. What makes you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to try out for our local kickball team. I'm looking forward to get some exercise and make new friends <endOfText>
<human> Yes sports can be a great way to socialize and also stay in good shape. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 21st birthday was in three day,  I could hardly sit still. <endOfText>
<human> Happy Early Birthday! What are your plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a loud bang outside my house recently and thought someone was trying to break in. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm finally done drawing this character for a contest. I think I'm happy with it now. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, I'm pretty bad at drawing, but you must be pretty good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was totally unexpected, but interesting too <endOfText>
<human> What was totally unexpected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the other day i saw a preview of my favorite game remake , resident evil two i was super hyped just remembering the old game <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? I was a little too young to be playing that game when it came out. My stepdad had the first one though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a local cafe near me, and they're always offering free coffee to people even if they don't buy anything. <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice I would get a cup daily if it was close to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my phone at my friend's place. It's unlocked, and I hope she doesn't go through it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hopefully it's a friend you trust and she won't embarrass you if she ends up going through it and finding something bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to explain to a friend why something is happening and they just couldn't get it. I don't get why they couldn't understand me. <endOfText>
<human> ohh, what did you try to explain them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to explain to them why the Great Recession was caused by the recycling of petrodollars and an unrestrained financial market. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh, sometimes people don't understand simple things. I think the words like 'petrodollars' might have confused them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma is very kind. She always makes me delicious cakes <endOfText>
<human> That's really sweet of her. What kinds of cakes does she make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked in on my buddy and my girlfriend in each others arms <endOfText>
<human> Thats sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my 13 year old shopping for schoo clothes today. <endOfText>
<human> Did they grow out of last years? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new job that pays a lot more than my previous one. I should be able to pay off my home sooner now <endOfText>
<human> Financial stability is such an amazing thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I accidentally farted very loud in school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, were you in class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I heard my brothers name called for graduation i could believe the emotion i felt. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet! What a proud moment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have some friends over for dinner today <endOfText>
<human> How was the dinner.  Did they like the food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my coworker out. She said yes. I never thought she'd agree. <endOfText>
<human> YEAH I am happy for you, I hope things go well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't wait to give my speech,  I was positive it was going to be well received. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad it went well. What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone asked me for some money to donate to their charity and I told them no. I feel so terrible but I have such a low income that I have to think about my family. <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand that. Sometimes the most important charity is your own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just feel awful and can't shake the feeling.  I work two jobs though and I have tons of medical bills but I always want to help others. <endOfText>
<human> I like to think that if you get yourself right financially now, you'll be more able to help more in the future.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my mom that I didin't want to be in compsci anymore, because I was really miserable. She said that I should do what makes me happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's good advice.  If you're not happy doing something you should spend time thinking about what you'd really like to be doing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just came back from the park. I saw so many dogs and oddly enough, cats <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, were the cats on leashes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Moved to a new city with a lower cost of living. I kind of feel isolated here <endOfText>
<human> ohhh, I feel you. I also moved to a new town, last week. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my big brother has always been better than me. <endOfText>
<human> Sibling rivalry is tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so grateful me and my ex are still friends <endOfText>
<human> I've seen a lot of bad breakups. Glad you guys are adults about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been with my employer for 8 years. They're going through a tough time now, and I'm trying to do my best although the work has been really hectic <endOfText>
<human> Are they going to shut down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have applied to 5 different colleges this year. <endOfText>
<human> How is that going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been planning this vacation for a while. Think I've got everything covered for a good time. <endOfText>
<human> OHHHH where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my entire family planned a beach vacation trip together and didn't include me. I am dumbfounded and irate! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that sucks. Were they trying to keep the trip a secret from you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once put my shoe on only to realize that there was a dead animal in it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yuck! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to volunteer at a local food bank. I hope I can make a positive difference. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing.  I have had to use a food bank before.  I was so gracious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying a new diet and it not as hard as ones I have tried before. <endOfText>
<human> What does this diet consist of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was ten my favorite friend moved to a new state. <endOfText>
<human> Aw. That was probably devastating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When the girl leaned in for a kiss all I could see was my beautiful wife whom I love. <endOfText>
<human> The girl is your wife, correct? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get a gift my daughter wanted <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, what did she want <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not sure whether I should date this girl. She seemed too good to be true <endOfText>
<human> was she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new neighbor is pretty cute. Going to talk to her tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> I wish you luck.  You have to meet the right one some day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I see my wife I am so happy.  She is everything I could ever want in life. <endOfText>
<human> She is one lucky gal. How long have you two been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to ask my girlfriend of 10 years to marry me next weekend. <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting!! Do you have the ring picked out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared last weekend when it stormed. I hate thunder <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. I bet it is hard to sleep during a loud storm. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store the other day and filled two carts full, but left with nothing! <endOfText>
<human> That always is annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job that would allow me to work at home because I suffer from Lupus. I didn't end up getting it so its a bummer. <endOfText>
<human> That too bad. They are other work from home opportunities though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is finally coming to America after years of waiting for approval. <endOfText>
<human> That's really awesome. I think its great when families are finally reunited.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really awesome. I think its great when families are finally reunited. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you. I really miss her and hope I can take care of her better now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work at a soup kitchen and there was this man who comes in every week. I think talking to me is the only contact he ever gets. <endOfText>
<human> People who take the time to help others are truely angels on Earth. Thank you for doing what you do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it upset me to see my brother with a brand new car <endOfText>
<human> Oh you must feel terrible. Has sibling rivalry always been a thing between you guys? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend said they wanted to talk to me and didn't sound like their usual on the phone. <endOfText>
<human> what did they want to talk about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling great since I have officially finished my Christmas shopping early! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! This is early. Maybe I should start, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't overeat like I usally do. I hope I can always do this <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is good are you dieting or doing portion control? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On Sundays I like to make my granny old recipes for my family. <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool. Are they hard to find recipes?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really cool. Are they hard to find recipes? <endOfText>
<human> No. I just like to cook some things the way she did. It reminds me of the time we had together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was checking the paper this morning, and I found our that I won $200 on the lottery! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Congratulations. What did you do with the $200? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad I'm able to pay my bills now. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? That's awesome! Do you have a new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out my fridge and found some meat that was over a month old. It was green and really gross. <endOfText>
<human> That is disgusting.  Sounds like my dad though,  He keeps things for months <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I was just lazy in cleaning stuff out, but I  won't make that mistake again! I don't like to throw up while I'm cleaning. <endOfText>
<human> UGH thats bad.  I bet is smelled like crap too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I awoke to a hot plate of bacon and eggs this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Eggs? I can't stand that stuff. Too many scambled eggs in college! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to a friend last week and felt bad. I just did not feel like hanging out <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes that happens. Were you tired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Driving to visit my mom yesterday reminded me so much of my childhood <endOfText>
<human> Memories like that are nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was saddened when i couldnt get out of work on time <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's always tough and frustrating.  What kept you behind?  Does it happen often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out a big closet today and found some Christmas ornaments of my kids feet when they were babies. So small and precious! <endOfText>
<human> oh thats sweet.. put them up this yeqar <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I definitely will! I can't wait because I love Christmas time.  I feel like a big kid during that season. <endOfText>
<human> thats great.. i love christmas time as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having trouble financially, and my coworker brings me lunch everyday <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to Ace every single class this semester. <endOfText>
<human> You sound determined. Go you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Came home to all my family here with a hot pot going! <endOfText>
<human> Really? You should be grateful that you have such a wonderful family.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I definitely won the family lottery. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah you should be really greatful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really? You should be grateful that you have such a wonderful family. <endOfText>
<human> I definitely won the family lottery.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife got into med school. She is really smart and definintly deserves to be a doctor! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations to her! You must be so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked in a good way when my dad got my a laptop. It was for school <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting you will definitely need it for school what kind did he get you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so exciting you will definitely need it for school what kind did he get you? <endOfText>
<human> It was just for keeping notes and creative writing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife came home to an entire table of food I cooked.  I like to show her that I love her. <endOfText>
<human> So many people don't take the time anymore. It's so nice to hear you did that for her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son worked really hard on his project. He won second place in the science fair! <endOfText>
<human> that so cool! I am happy.  whats did he create? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once saw a woman who could contort her body in all types of ways,  It was amazing. <endOfText>
<human> what types of things could she do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to see my dog find his way home the other day <endOfText>
<human> He was probably hungry, and thought to himself, that place wasn't so bad huh. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sad with myself when I quit the basketball team. I thought I would do better <endOfText>
<human> Why did you quit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like seeing people with lots of money. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a restaurant that has been around for a while. They're closing down after the wife passed away. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. It's a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's terrible. It's a shame that they were not able to keep the place going in her memory. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, I think it would remind them too much of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friends wanted me to leave out my other good friend and not tell her about our beach trip we were planning. I told her that I wouldn't go unless we could all go together because I just don't leave people out. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. I'm glad you stood up for your friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am fiercely loyal to my friends and don't think anyone should be excluded, especially among a group of friends that are all going but one person.  Not cool. <endOfText>
<human> Why would your friend want to exclude your other friend? Definitely not cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am just now seeing Wonder Woman. As a woman I am ashamed <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel ashamed about the movie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ashamed that I am just now seeing it. It is such a good movie! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I see! I guess I should watch it as well! I never seen it yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to ask someone out on a date, but I don't know if I should. <endOfText>
<human> Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i liked taking care of of my sisters pet the other day <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you had a good time. What pet is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My local store stopped carrying my favorite spring rolls. <endOfText>
<human> were you able to find them somewhere else <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous my first day of college. I did not know anyone <endOfText>
<human> I was too, but then I realized everyone was too and I made a lot of friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a walk through my local park and it was great! I realized that my life was pretty great while I was walking! <endOfText>
<human> Going to the park is always nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really is. I always feel better after taking a walk. <endOfText>
<human> I do too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sent a 3k check to my cousin. I never sent that much money through the mail before. <endOfText>
<human> Did they receive it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I quit my job last week <endOfText>
<human> Oh what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive to see the lakers get lebron a few weeks ago <endOfText>
<human> Yes I agree! Do you think he'll help them win some games? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got up to get cereal this morning, but my roommate drank all my milk. <endOfText>
<human> did he get a beat down ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, most definitely. I used my belt. <endOfText>
<human> hah.. thats cool.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend's best friend is a female. <endOfText>
<human> Does that bother you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was confident I was going to pass my drivers test. I studied hard for it <endOfText>
<human> How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new restaurant in my neighborhood today <endOfText>
<human> How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a party at work today. Totally unannounced. <endOfText>
<human> Who was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once walked around school campus and found toilet paper on my shoe.  It had been hours since I was in the restroom last. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did anyone notice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A girl hit on me at an event, but I've got a girlfriend. Not interested. <endOfText>
<human> Thats right,  You have to stay faithful to the one you love. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once found money in the parking lot of a gas station. I needed it so bad I kept it. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes when we're in a bad situation, we do things we wouldn't normally do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the gym today and some guy pumped out like 50 pull ups. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty impressive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, the guy was built like the Incredible Hulk. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I could look like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to pass my history final. I loved that class <endOfText>
<human> Sweet! Congratulations. Was it difficult?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sweet! Congratulations. Was it difficult? <endOfText>
<human> It was not, it was kind of easy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was proud of my dad when he retired. He worked hard for a long time <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's sweet. Did you get to have a party for him or anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my pet died I felt liek I lost my family member,  My best friend. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sister always borrows money from me. <endOfText>
<human> OH my,  does she ever give it back.  Is it alot of money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once woke up from sleeping to feel paralyzed,  like someone was standing on my chest. <endOfText>
<human> oh ive heard of that before.. scary stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went into that interview knowing i was going to get the job <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel like you interview well regularly? were you qualified? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea i prepare for every possible question they can throw at me.. i was the most qualified <endOfText>
<human> Then its a no brainer,  I hope that you make alot of money there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved away from my family and friends to start a new job next week. I'm looking forward to it but its so isolating not knowing a single person. <endOfText>
<human> Have you gone out to try to meet people yet?  are you happy about our job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once finished a whole bag of candy, just after startinf my new diet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  I don't doubt it.  Diets make you so hungry and gives you crazy cravings for what you can't have.  Did it feel worth it or make you feel miserable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner and I were sitting down to dinner when they bring out fish. They know that I don't like fish, yet they did anyways. It's very upsetting! <endOfText>
<human> I would have been upset too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went thrift shopping for the first time today <endOfText>
<human> That's good. I always find interesting things whenever I go.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's good. I always find interesting things whenever I go. <endOfText>
<human> I found some really cool thing. I think I am going to go again next weekend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep a photo of my grandfather in my wallet. It reminds me of him since he passed a few years ago. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear about your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends asked me to go out with them, but I had to decline it because I have to save money for bills. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's a very mature decision of you. It's better than over spending. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> how did you respond <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone the other day when my family left home <endOfText>
<human> That's understandable, what did you do to pass the time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thankful when my Granny gave me money for graduation. It was sweet of her <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like a sweety! Is she coming to gradution? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a pizza, but the delivery person gave me an extra one. <endOfText>
<human> That is a great delivery person <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when I was elected class president. I was not expecting that <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Any big plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset with my daughter today <endOfText>
<human> Why are you upset <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was chilling outside all day in the sun reading. I feel great. <endOfText>
<human> sounds like a good day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait to get my next paycheck <endOfText>
<human> Payday is always my favorite day of the week! Do you plan to buy anything special?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Payday is always my favorite day of the week! Do you plan to buy anything special? <endOfText>
<human> get chocolate wasted! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Grandma, whom I absolutely love and is the best Grandma, is moving back to my city to live here! I never thought she would but I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, what will you do when you first see her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful.  Why do people risk their lives and the lives of others just to get a tiny bit ahead in traffic to where there going.  Ridiculous.  I'm glad you weren't hit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I'm going to get fired tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait to start school last semester. I wanted to learn more <endOfText>
<human> It is nice that you love learning so much.  What are you studying that you like that much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is joing the band this year <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. I bet she is excited. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling very happy now since my wife just got a new job she really wanted. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What is the job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put way too much on my credit card and can't even afford the minimum payment. The thing is, my dad's name is on the card too. I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> Its hard to maintain that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic when I hear Elvis. It reminds me of when I was younger and my dad <endOfText>
<human> Did your dad love listening to Elvis? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to be responsible for the powerpoint slides for our presentation, but I accidentally deleted it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! So what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ahppy to have such talented kids. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear. You must be so proud of them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love my parents to death we grew up poor, but we always had all the basic stuff needed for school and clothing <endOfText>
<human> Your parents sound like wonderful people! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting to hear back from my doctor about my test results. <endOfText>
<human> oh that sounds super scary , i hope everything comes back ok <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was very calming going to the mountains last week. I just felt right <endOfText>
<human> What mountains did you visit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family looks out for me no matter what, it's great to have them on my side, especially when I was struggling. <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to have family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend won a scholarship to go to school overseas. She worked all through high school. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea, it is. She's also a really nice person. <endOfText>
<human> i hope it turns out well for her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going camping this weekend and I bought everything I need well in advance. <endOfText>
<human> You have to be prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think me and my ex are broken up for good. <endOfText>
<human> I see, is that a good thing or bad thing for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While a lot of my coworkers quit to go to a competitor, I'm staying with my company. <endOfText>
<human> Loyalty is always good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to pass my math test. I studied all week <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Hard work does pay off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to a work conference last week.  I didn't know anyone there, and I really don't like to travel without my family.  It was hard. <endOfText>
<human> That does sound tough, did it go well at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter told me she wants toplay bass guitar. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome have you checked out the price for lessons? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year i got so stuffed last year during thanksgiving that i fell asleep watching football before they even served dessert <endOfText>
<human> Lol. Was there any left when you woke up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Definitely I cant wait for this years thanksgiving <endOfText>
<human> SO that history can repeat itself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really need to get some milk from the store but when I go there I realized I had left my wallet at home. I just walked out with jug and felt so bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> It happens to the best of us <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah but that doesn't make it right. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my team lost last weekend. I really wanted them to win <endOfText>
<human> Hey you win some you lose some. What really matter is that you had fun watching.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey you win some you lose some. What really matter is that you had fun watching. <endOfText>
<human> I did not have fun watching them lose <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just went for my yearly physical and thought everything was good, but I got a call that the doctor wanted to talk to me about some blood work. Its awful because they aren't open until tomorrow so they haven't gotten back to me yet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that. You must be so worried. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a wonderful family and can do the things I enjoy. I don't think I can ask for more in life. <endOfText>
<human> That is so great to hear.  Nice to hear someone being happy with the important things in life and not always wanting more.  Its easy to miss things happening all around you if you are never happy with them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i trusted my brother the other day and regret it <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hoping to go out with my friend's this weekend, but it was raining all weekend. <endOfText>
<human> It's been raining a lot here, too, I know that feeling! Did you manage to find something interesting to do inside instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just read a lot but really wanted to do something outdoors. <endOfText>
<human> Being cooped up is the worst. Hopefully next weekend is nice and sunny for you and your friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my dad was going to pick me up last week. He was a man of his word <endOfText>
<human> I love a person of their word he is a great father keeping his word. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm shocked that my daughter stole alcohol from my locked cabinet and tried to place the bottle with water. <endOfText>
<human> Only water? That is crazy lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am kind of sad the summer break is ending <endOfText>
<human> I think we all feel you on that one!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think we all feel you on that one! <endOfText>
<human> I am ready for them to go back to school, but we had a lot of fun this summer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been with my wife for 13 years. <endOfText>
<human> That is very sweet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was embarrassed when my zipper was down all day. I did not realize it until I got home <endOfText>
<human> Sucks that no one told you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece can't swim but has is staying with us for a bit and we have a pool.  Her skills are increasing and her confidence is soaring! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome .. how long has she been learning? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive when the lakers signed lebron <endOfText>
<human> Yes that was an exciting moment for him and for the team as well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid's school makes sure all the kids' parents know how to fill out low income forms. There are so many parents who don't know enough English, and their kids go hungry when they don't have to. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good thing, right? So the families can get the help they need? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for this new video game to come out in November. It will be great to play it but it so far away! <endOfText>
<human> What game are you waiting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The newest pokemon game "Let's Go Pickachu" A bit nerdy I know but I love the series. <endOfText>
<human> I used to love those games growing up so I can't judge you for it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole alcohol from my dad and was caught and decided to lie instead of confessing. I'm ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> Hey it's ok. We all do stupid things when we are young.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey it's ok. We all do stupid things when we are young. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah but I don't know if he's ever gonna talk to me again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new dog recently and have found myself really enjoying taking care of it. <endOfText>
<human> That is so great I love dogs they are so sweet and your best friend for life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids have beem gone for days. The house is so quiet. <endOfText>
<human> enjoy it while it lasts <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh sorry to hear that then <endOfText>
<human> I can't wait til they come back. Im weird lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared when i had to walk home alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> OH no. Was it really late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea and we live in a wooded area <endOfText>
<human> I watch too many murder shows to do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a pizza today and it was not good. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's disappointing. What was wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ewwwwwww...the devil's topping. Did you send it back? <endOfText>
<human> No. They did give me a refund though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt alone last week. All of my friends were out of town <endOfText>
<human> That sounds horribly boring. You can always take this time to do some house work that you put off, so that it will be ready when your friends get back in town. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took $5 out of my 5 year old's birthday stash yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> What did you use the $5 for? Something good hopefully! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just told me her husband surprised her for their anniversary and is taking her on a cruise. I am happy for her but I haven't been on a vacation for 5 years so it was painful to hear too. <endOfText>
<human> You will have your day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when I missed my credit card bill. I felt dumb <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I've done that before.  Did you call them and ask for a grace period so you didn't build fines?  We all make mistakes like that so don't beat yourself up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a bag of frozen fish last week to cook today. <endOfText>
<human> Was it any good? Frozen foods can be weird. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so annoying. You're better off buying fresh on the day, even if it's inconvenient. <endOfText>
<human> I know better now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend just got engaged. <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy for them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had this big meeting at work and it went great. All that hard work before hand really paid off! <endOfText>
<human> thats good.. seem like a good employee <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do try my best to be ready for anything my company asks me to do. <endOfText>
<human> there arent a lot of dedicated people like you. keep it up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im a little on the fence if i should ask for time off this week <endOfText>
<human> If you need to take time off, then I'm sure your company will understand.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If you need to take time off, then I'm sure your company will understand. <endOfText>
<human> yea but i should probably save it for later down the road in case one of my kids get sick <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got straight A's in his summer class. I'm very happy about that. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Summer classes can be tough. Because its summer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I buy things that my kids don't like so I don't have to share. <endOfText>
<human> Haha that's a smart strategy. What kind of things do you like to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad last week when I was caught in a lie. I felt like a rat <endOfText>
<human> What was the lie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am such a sap. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently adopted a dog and have been enjoying taking care of it. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's so sweet of you. Doggos can be so rewarding.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw, that's so sweet of you. Doggos can be so rewarding. <endOfText>
<human> They sure can. I think it's exactly what I needed at this time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used my skills to pick the winning numbers in the lottery today. I feel pretty good about myself. <endOfText>
<human> I don't doubt that you're feeling good about yourself! Are you getting the lump sum of monthly payments? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my life is pretty good right now. <endOfText>
<human> thats good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious last week when my friend got a new car. It makes me want one <endOfText>
<human> Are you able to afford one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has this habit of getting too drunk and losing her mind on every vacation we go on. I'm thinking about canceling the one we have planned in a few weeks. <endOfText>
<human> You should to them before you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a cake for a party and didn't end up going. I had a slice and then another and another until I ate the whole thing. I didn't tell anyone., til now. <endOfText>
<human> Was the cake god? Sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ha ha.  It was amazing!  I really didn't feel sick because I hadn't eaten lunch or dinner with how busy the day was.  It is so sinfully rich though. Double layered with icing in the middle. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so yummy! See you much have needed those calories with skipping meals. Sounds like your a great baker as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was the cake god? Sometimes you have to have your cake and eat it too haha. <endOfText>
<human> ha ha.  It was amazing!  I really didn't feel sick because I hadn't eaten lunch or dinner with how busy the day was.  It is so sinfully rich though. Double layered with icing in the middle.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my landloard still hasnt fixed my stove <endOfText>
<human> Ugh. That's the worst. Have you called him/her?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh. That's the worst. Have you called him/her? <endOfText>
<human> Yes. It has been a week. We couldnt male our homemade pizzas like we do every saturday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend to me I'm dumb and really bad at my job. I'm so upset with him! <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that , whant happened ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i like to exercise 5 days a week, and eat super clean on weekends i have 2 cheat days, im feel disapointed in myself sometimes when i go over ,and have 3 cheat days <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry about it. Everybody messes up sometimes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah i know , and thank you i just sometimes have little decipline <endOfText>
<human> It just take a lot of practice, but you will get there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard something under my bed last night and freaked out. <endOfText>
<human> what was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when i got promoted a few months back <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  Congatulations!!!! Did you get a big raise, too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been single two years now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh ok! Is that a bad thing or do you enjoy being single? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  was scared to go home the other day <endOfText>
<human> Why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hurt and saddened when my aunt passed away. No one expected it <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that.. what happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom cheated on my dad!! How could she?? <endOfText>
<human> I hate that for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when my brother bought me a vacation package. It was a nice gesture <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, any special reason for him doing that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went through allof m FB photo albums today <endOfText>
<human> That's always so fun to see everything that's gone on in your life.  Do you have a favorite moment that was captured in a picture? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was awful. I had a piano solo with a band that I joined and we play all over the place. Anyway, I bombed it and forgot a section so skipped forward and fumbled with the notes. Crushing. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. You're not quitting are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I promised my daughter I would watch IT wih her tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's a pretty scary movie.  I'd want company while watching it too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I promised so I hope I can do it <endOfText>
<human> Good luck.  But besides it being scary it's a good film in general.  Hope you two can enjoy it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a test at work tomorrow to see if I can get a promotion. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats really nice , my friend in new york also has to do a test soon to get a promotion, i hope u get it - u can do it !!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for thanksgiving all the food around me , and see all my family pigging out makes me so happy and thankful for everything in life <endOfText>
<human> I think that you are absolutely right!  Thanksgiving is the best!  I love the food, and family.  Are your family coming to you, or are you going to the? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when my brother canceled plans tonight. I was looking forward to hanging out <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, Did you reschedule? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got back with her ex AGAIN <endOfText>
<human> Why would she do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a person tv tonight that was impressive. He made me want to save money <endOfText>
<human> It wasn't Dave Ramsey was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my ipad the othe day <endOfText>
<human> Have you found it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A kid I went to school with is in jail for harming a puppy, what a vile human! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is terrible. <endOfText>
<human> It really is, what possesses someone to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super nervous about the day today as a semi family member has been acting up and I didn't want them to ruin anyones day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is nerve-racking.You have to be on-guard. Did they behave themselves?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that is nerve-racking.You have to be on-guard. Did they behave themselves? <endOfText>
<human> They did unfortunately. I'll just never understand people who like to make everyone else miserable just because they are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh. I don't understand that either. And they make everyone so anxious just be existing. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry they DIDN'T. I know right! Always walking on eggshells! I'll never get it! Just be in peace or behave. One of the two <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could sit around and eat and sleep all day like my cat. <endOfText>
<human> That would be great wouldn't it? They have it made! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live by myself. My apartment seems really empty some time. <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling.  I have a husband and a boyfriend living here and it still feels empty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought me dinner tonight. I was very thankful <endOfText>
<human> It's nice to have generous friends.  Did you have something good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my car to the mechanic the other day.  I don't know anything bout cars, but I know my guy is honest. <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to have a reliable person like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter showed me a poem she wrote earlier today <endOfText>
<human> oh cool, what was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty upset tonight. My friend canceled plans on me <endOfText>
<human> Did they have a good reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY son just wasted my soda on some important papers. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, how important were they <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my friend invited me over tonight. It had been awhile <endOfText>
<human> It's always nice to visit with friends you haven't seen in a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to my friend's birthday party a few weeks ago <endOfText>
<human> Did you have fun?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter got straight As all year long! She worked so hard! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I wish my daughter was determined like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was coming home last night kinda late and It was really dark outside my house.. <endOfText>
<human> There are some apps that allow a friend to follow your progress as you home. Will that make you feel safer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read this amazing book. The author is so smart! <endOfText>
<human> Whats it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My out-of-town relatives are visiting, and there was on relative whom I really enjoy speaking with, that I didn't get to hang out with much while they were here. I won't get to seem them for a while, so it kind of stinks we didn't make the most of our time this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh well, there is always next time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to get this job. I was prepared for it <endOfText>
<human> I'm really glad to hear that! What kind of job is it, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hiking the other day and I ran across a dead deer with maggots eating on it. It smelled so bad! <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was disgusting! I would bring a noseplug from now on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took care of my sick cat over the weekend. I just had to care for him as much as I could <endOfText>
<human> That's really sweet of you. I hope your cat is doing better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The entire last month I was getting ready for a trip around the world. Takes a lot of planning! <endOfText>
<human> That does sound fun though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yup. Now that I'm finally ready, I'll be taking off in about a week. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you have fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking at pictures of a recent vacation I took with my girlfriend to the Colorado Mountains. It stinks because we're long distance, so not only do I have to be sad about the vacation being over, but also sad about being far apart again. But at least seeing the pictures brings back great memories <endOfText>
<human> That's what pictures are for. Are you guys ever going to live together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had excargot over the summer on a cruise <endOfText>
<human> The snails? Yikes. Well, I've always thought it probably gets a worse rap than it actually should, and probably doesn't taste that bad. Half of why I think it's probably gross is simply because they made it seem gross in old cartoons. So, how did it taste? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter will be in high school next year <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I feel for you.  Kids grow up so fast.  Do you feel prepared for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear you.  I have a 8 year old daughter and it feels like she was born yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I am going to cry now lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone just stole my car. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks? Did you see anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm taking care of my two nephews this weekend while their parents are out of town, and it's nice to see how the older one takes care of the younger one, despite them just being 7 and 2, respectively. It's awesome to see brothers caring for each other for a change, and it made me feel good about them. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, so you enjoy looking after them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to cancel on my friend tonight. I felt bad when I did too <endOfText>
<human> That happens sometimes. Sometimes life just gets in the way. Heck, sometimes you just decide you can't physically do a night out, and that's okay, too. I'm sure they'd understand no matter what. Maybe you can make it up to them somehow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend and I had an argument this afternoon, while she's about to go away to see relatives for a week. It's kind of a bummer because we don't really communicate that well, especially when it comes to arguments. It usually devolves into us rather not talking instead of trying to fully speak out our issues. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, I guess some friends just argue like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait for last weekend to get here. We were going to see some new breweries <endOfText>
<human> I love visiting breweries! What's your favorite kind of beer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pretty envious that my friend can go out and buy a new car with the snap of a finger. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh gotta hate that friend!   What do you drive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ahhhh I wish I was 18 again.. Things were so different back then.. <endOfText>
<human> In what ways do you mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son passed his exams at school with good grade. I am so proud of him <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congratulations to him! He must have been studying very hard for his exams. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to a different state for my husband's job and left the rest of my family behind. <endOfText>
<human> oh, dear. That sounds lonely. How are you holding up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved away from my home town last year for a new job. I sort of regret it since I don't have many people to talk to. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel.  I moved about 3 hours away from my hometown for school and stayed for 3 years and hated it.  I moved back to my hometown and am so happy now.  I'm sorry you're having a tough time.  Have you gotten out and tried to meet people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't able to go to California for a family reunion and a friend of mine paid for tickets for my husband and me! I haven't seen my family in years and she made my year, my century! <endOfText>
<human> That is a great friend! I'm happy you were able to see your family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into the bathroom at work today and someone had clogged it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's really frustrating.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that's really frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> It was more than that, it was horrifying.  I have never seen anything more disturbing in my life.  The toilet was overflowing onto the floor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really optomistic about climate change. I think wed really can solve this crucial issue. <endOfText>
<human> I do, too.  We just need to take better care of the resources we have and plant more trees.  Do you do anything "green". <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I recycle. <endOfText>
<human> If we could just get more people on board to do that we would be on the right track. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my dad would pull through when he had the flu in a bad way. I just had faith <endOfText>
<human> I am glad that he did. It is always good to stay hopeful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an ad for Disneyland and I remembered the first time I had ever been there <endOfText>
<human> I LOVED Disneyland growing up! Did you go often? How old were you and what was your favorite ride? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked in a good way when my aunt made my graduation. She lived out of state <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. That's a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome! What a nice surprise. And congratulations on graduating. That's a big accomplishment. What did you graduate in? <endOfText>
<human> It was in english <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somehow a LEGO got stuck under my front-door to my house, and now it helped to crack the frame of the door, and it needs to be replaced. What's worse is I had just gotten done telling my child that they need to make sure they're more responsible with their toys, and to put them in their appropriate places. I'm trying to be patient and not overreact in the situation, but it's hard. <endOfText>
<human> Just try and teach them to be more careful with them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having car trouble lately, but my brother in law has been helping me get around. I'm so thankful towards him./ <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of him to do. No one wants to help anyone out these days but I'm glad for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom lost her battle with cancer, I was prepared for it but it still hurts so bad. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that! Cancer is such a horrible disease. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my mom's purse. I'm so ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. Does she know that it happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah she caught me and yelled at me. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Maybe next time you can just ask her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting to see if I got that new job I applied for <endOfText>
<human> Best of luck to you. The tension and nerves must be killing you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been struggling with a flare up from my Rheumatoid Arthritis after I had such a long period of feeling good. Its depressing to be in bed all day and fail your family in what you need to be doing. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you have that. It must be rough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty nervous starting my new job. I was not sure what to expect <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congratulations on getting a new job!  I think butterflies are good to have to make us do our best and it shows your job is important to you and you want to do a good job.  What do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At a office party, I tried to invite a female coworker for a drink. She rejected me in front of everybody. I felt bad. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that's rough. That was a very bold move on your part. But sometimes fortune favors the bold, as they say. I think you'll be happy later on not having to wonder "what if." Still though, she could have maybe been more discrete about things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in line getting fast food today, and the person in front of me paid for my meal! I offered to do the same for the person behind me, even though I always think that's cheesy when I hear about it. But it was still kind of a cool event that happened, as I'm sure it carried on a while. <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a lonesome weekend. All of my friends were busy <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes that can be a good thing? It's not always so bad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can feel a cold sore coming on on my lip! Quite a frustrating thing before a big job interview I have! <endOfText>
<human> I hate when those come around <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my friend today and told him I was too busy to hang out because I just wanted to be alone. I do feel sort of bad. <endOfText>
<human> you should not feel bad ,we all need alone time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little unsure going to a movie alone tonight. It did not feel right <endOfText>
<human> There is nothing wrong with that at all. I've done it a few times before. Nobody in the theater knows or cares that you're there alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting on a flight in a couple of days. Kind of nervous because I've never flown before, and I just have a weird feeling about it. Like, I know it will be fine, but I'm worried about the safety of plans, I'm worried about getting lost, I'm worried about being far from home.. Just a little overwhelming. <endOfText>
<human> where are you going <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It must be nice for people to go on exotic vacations every time they turn around. <endOfText>
<human> I would love to do that as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy with myself tonight. I ate really healthy <endOfText>
<human> That's great! It's hard to do that sometimes, especially on the weekends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been told that I am too gullible. One time someone told me they were a celebrity and I believed them. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what did they say to convince you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The company that I working for is having financials issues. I am happy that I wasn't part of the recent lay off. <endOfText>
<human> That is a relief. Did any coworker friends get laid off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of my co-worker, who seems to be in such good shape and able to have the willpower and patience to work out so much, and eat a healthy diet, while doing the same workload as me. I would love to look like he does, but I just don't have the patience. I wonder what his secret to success would be, if I asked <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you can change that jealous energy into positive energy! Do some research into fitness and start a new journey. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog managed to slip out the door yesterday and ended up going straight for the road and got ran over. I feel so horrible. <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow, that's terrible. I really feel for you. My dad had that happen to him and his dog when he was young, and he's told me about it as a warning to make sure I'm safe with ours. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. I hope you get through the grieving process okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend randomly gave me a gift out of nowhere! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, what did he give you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Took my son to ER because he had a sore throat.  They misdiagnosed it and it got worse. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's not good at all. It's hard to diagnose things sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I plan to buy a home soon, and will be moving.  I'm really anticipating having to pack everything up and what a new house will feel like. <endOfText>
<human> Oh now that's exciting! I moved two years ago and it was a very weird process. I was happy to have a new home but anxious at the same time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend who's been weight lifting with me for years now and he looks better than me. I wish I had his genetics! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I totally understand.  It's frustrating when you feel like you're putting in the same effort (or more!) and it works better for other people.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I totally understand.  It's frustrating when you feel like you're putting in the same effort (or more!) and it works better for other people. <endOfText>
<human> It sure is frustrating, but I can't say I haven't made great progress myself. But his progress is insane! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the times when me and my cousins were going to the beach when we were young. <endOfText>
<human> Ah yes, does it bring back good memories? Nostalgia is a powerful thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were at a family gathering, and my relatives were in town for the weekend and we were saying our final goodbyes before they headed back home. My nephew stood up in front of everyone and farted. He's 11... He should be able to know better. I cringed. <endOfText>
<human> That sure is embarrassing, did he get talked to about his behavior?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sure is embarrassing, did he get talked to about his behavior? <endOfText>
<human> No. His parents weren't there to hear it or witness it. I didn't feel like ratting him out or dealing with it, either. Kind of lazy on my part. Everyone just kind of shrugged it off and laughed awkwardly, but you could tell everyone was thinking, "Really? Why?" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My child said his first word the other day! It wasn't mama or da-da, but at least he's making progress! His first word was "one." Not the most meaningful or memorable, but I'm just proud of him anyway. <endOfText>
<human> You should be proud. These are the moments you are never going to want to forget. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really said. I'm missing my youthful vigor. <endOfText>
<human> Your youthful vigor? You think you're too old now? You're only too old if you allow yourself to be. My girlfriend's 90-year-old grandfather was a full-of-life WWII vet who lit up the room when he came in. Of course, you're not as physically active, but you have to learn to utilize your life in different ways. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I just don't have the energy I need to do things I want to. <endOfText>
<human> Well, maybe it's an opportunity for introspection. For you to take time out of your day to think about what you need and want, and what are the best ways to achieve that. Maybe you need a better diet, or sleep schedule, or meditation, or an exercise routine. Sometimes you have to spend energy to feel energized. It's a slow process in the beginning, but it can be life-changing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why? What's going on on Friday? <endOfText>
<human> Any plans for Friday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For my last birthday I told my husband I didn't want a gift but he got me a laptop... I was very happy! <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you were! What kind of laptop was it? <endOfText>
<human> I'm not sure, I dont know much. IT's a LEnovo but he says it can handle video games and everything so Im excited <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a minor league ball game last night and I saw a pitcher throw over 101 miles per hour!  It was amazing to see in real life <endOfText>
<human> Wowza! That's impressive. I wonder how long until he's called up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone slammed into my car and totaled it while it was parked. I am so mad because I didn't have insurance on it yet since I just bought it. The worst timing ever! <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry to hear that... That's the worst scenario too, because you're parked and probably not even there, so you were completely powerless in the situation, and then you come back to your car to just have this bomb dropped on you. Maybe there's something that can be worked out, since you just purchased it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks.  Yeah, I'm trying to figure out what kind of coverage I have if I just purchased it.  It might have still been on the other persons insurance.  I had to take off work and am losing money all around. <endOfText>
<human> There has to be something. It can't just be this weird vulnerable loophole. I really hope so, for your case, because that's just unfair. I'm sure your work will understand, but it's still a crummy situation that is probably affecting all areas of your life. Transportation gets taken for granted. Hope things get better soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents came and visited me from out of town. It was so great to see them again, and they brought so much energy back into my small crummy apartment and isolated life. But now they've gone back home and it's back to an empty room and not having anyone to talk to. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so glad you got to visit with them!  I know how you feel to be far from family and home alone.  Take heart that you are loved by your family and friends even when they aren't around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's the middle of the night and someone is banging on my garage door! <endOfText>
<human> That's quite scary!  Are you able to see who it is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a friend of my show of his juggling skills recently. I got to say, I was quite dazzled by his skills! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how long has he been juggling for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once was traveling at a speed in excess of the speed limit.  A police officer was waiting just off the side of the road beyond the hill I had just cross, and I immediately knew he had me. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes you just have to concede defeat. I admire your resigned attitude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I baked Christmas cookies last year I meant to bring some to my neighbors. But I had to eat a few first. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no.  I think I see where this is headed.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, no.  I think I see where this is headed. <endOfText>
<human> Well a few turned into a few more and before I knew it there were none left to share. I felt so bad. Next Christmas I will make up for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to achieve my diet goals finally. It has been one year that I am on diet. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on making a plan and sticking with it. What kind of diet are you doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was doing shores outside and was just finishing up when a lizard jumped on me out of nowhere! <endOfText>
<human> did it bite you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i returned to my car and noticed someone put a dent in my car <endOfText>
<human> That would really anger me as well.  What did you do?  Did you find the person who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im really happy about how my life is going and i cannot wait for the future. <endOfText>
<human> I'm happy for you! Everyone deserves to be excited about life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cooked for family last week and it tasted pretty bad. I know they noticed, but they didn't say anything. <endOfText>
<human> Your family was being polite. If I did that my family would order a pizza, hah. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really looking forward to the next Avatar movie. It seems like I have been waiting forever. <endOfText>
<human> I didn't even know they were making another, I loved the first! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been high nutrient vegan for 3 months now and got on the scale today only to discover that I have lost 34 pounds! I was shocked! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow, I am doing a presentation to my CEO. I am sure that I will give a good impression. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, good luck.  I hope it all goes well. It sounds like you're confident that it will. Have you done one before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you know Double Dare came back? My favorite show of the 90s! I feel like a kid again. <endOfText>
<human> Really?  That is awesome.  I used to watch reruns of that show all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other night I was watching this documentary about a puppy mill getting busted and the dogs getting rescued.  I wanted to adopt everyone of them <endOfText>
<human> Those poor dogs! I hate puppy mills so much and unfortunately I live in an area where they are very common. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared when i saw that owl staring at me <endOfText>
<human> Oooh I don't like owls... they creep me out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old box of photos today. It was so nice looking through photos of my childhood. I'm glad my parents capture those moments <endOfText>
<human> did you get to keep them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a raise lately and didn't expect a raise this big! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is awesome, did you ask your boss for one or was it unexpected? <endOfText>
<human> It was unexpected, so it was even better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cubicle neighbor at work really bothers me. He eats all day long and is always chewing loud foods with his mouth open! I can barely think with him chomping like a cow! <endOfText>
<human> I hate that. That's one of my biggest pet peeves. That's such an awkward situation, because you don't want to come off as high maintenance and ask them to stop, but it'd be so easy for them to have better manners, too. I wish I had better advice. Maybe go to HR? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Starting to get better at jogging. Last summer I could only jog a couple of miles. Now I'm working up past 5 miles, to 7 and 8 miles each time I go out. I need to get a lot better with my mile times, but I'm starting to get interested in the idea of a half marathon. <endOfText>
<human> Wow!  That is impressive!  You must be really prod of yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one time i got to work and my manager said where have you been , i didnt think much of it i said in bed relaxing , shes like your late 3 hours i guess i wrote my squedule wrong, it felt so bad <endOfText>
<human> Hey, honest mistake. Obviously you didn't come up with some dumb lie and make it seem like they made the mistake and not you. You owned up to it. I'm sure they appreciate that more than you would figure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was grocery shopping, and saw my old best fried in the dairy aisle. Haven't spoken to them in like ten years, even though we used to be really close. We caught up a little bit, and exchanged numbers to talk more later. Funny how small the world is sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> yes dude the world is a trip, i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chit chat and shake hands, you never know when someone will pass away ,  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes dude the world is a trip, i made many friends over the years online and when i bump into them i make sure i go up to them and chit chat and shake hands, you never know when someone will pass away , <endOfText>
<human> That's actually a really good point.. I do online gaming, so I have tons of online friends, almost all of which I'm sure I'll never meet. And I definitely have lost touch with most of them, just because it's so easy to. I don't really do social media either, so I don't have that to kind of glue things together. Wonder why it's hard for adults to keep friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss just informed me that I will be getting a bunch of unfinished work from a coworker that was promoted. I am so mad that I have to do my stuff and someone elses incomplete work! <endOfText>
<human> That's so unfair. I would complain very loudly if that happened to me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when i saw lebron james go to the lakers <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome!  He is such an amazing athlete!  Any team that has him is lucky! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going zip-lining in Colorado in a week. There is only one problem I am really scared of heights! <endOfText>
<human> wow .. so am i .. i could not imagine doing that. its great that you are going to do it though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning I found a garden snake in my yard! It wasn't very big but I don't like snakes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, my dad use to play with those all the time when we were young and he'd let us touch them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been putting off buying a computer part that I needed and just noticed it went up 10%! I'm pretty mad at myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate when that happens... hopefully your computers holds on a little longer for it to go back down <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, it is more than a month past the 4th of July.  My neighbors are still shooting off fireworks at night.  I am not happy. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, why are they still shooting off fireworks? Don't they know it's a one day holiday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the old days when life was simple. There were no cell phones or Internet. People had to talk to each other. <endOfText>
<human> yea i hear that... it was much better back then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was impressed when a friend of mine got a job 2 days after telling me he wanted to quit <endOfText>
<human> That is impressive. He must have been prepared well for the switch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having a baby in 3 weeks..... the waiting is makjing anxious! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how exciting! Boy or girl?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, how exciting! Boy or girl? <endOfText>
<human> a girl... time is going fast but slow at the same time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I'm sure! Is this your first? <endOfText>
<human> No second, I have another girl :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So a few years ago, my best friend who lives in NYC  surprised me by flying down to spend New Year's Eve with me in my city. I had no idea! <endOfText>
<human> wow that's such an awesome surprise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it was so cool! She and my husband secretly coordinated it. <endOfText>
<human> that's a great husband and best friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i was told i couldnt go home on time <endOfText>
<human> Where were you at? Why couldn't you go home? Sounds frustrating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started a month long class for work in a town that I have never been. I feel so isolated in my hotel by myself. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds lonely. Maybe you should try to hang out with some of your classmates? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I put my shirt on inside out by accident. I didn't realize it until someone told me at school. <endOfText>
<human> That's hilarious!  Did you try to play it off like you meant to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened an old box of my grandfathers possessions that I was given after he passed away and found his watch that he always wore. I became really nostalgic and thought of all the good times I had with him. <endOfText>
<human> It is always good to take the time to reflect on happy memories.  I do that from time to time myself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One the way to work, I got a flat tire and I missed a very important presentation.  I was pretty upset. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man!  That is a nightmare!  Was your boss upset with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat is very sick. <endOfText>
<human> whats wrong with your cat <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw someone had dented my car door <endOfText>
<human> That would make me mad. Did you know who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am tired of feeling like I have to compete for my boyfriend's attention. <endOfText>
<human> time to look for one that deserves you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet ferret Fuzzy died the other day. I was so heart-broken. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat of 15 years passed away today... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, why are all the pets dying. It is so sad when that happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day I walked out front door and there was a coral snake laying there. I jumped and ran back inside <endOfText>
<human> I would have done the same! I don't like snakes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pregnant but wasn't able to have a baby shower but all my friends and family sent us nice little gifts.... It was such a nice thing of them to do <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice. Why couldn't you have a baby shower? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally spilled my coffee on my date a few days ago <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Inquiring minds want to know... is there plans for a second date? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new city for my job. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone let my dog out while I was at work! I can't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> Who let him out? Did he run away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no idea! I came home and my backyard gate was open. I can't find him anywhere. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so sad. I hope you find him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am done looking for love. I keep getting rejected over and over again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes when you "give up", someone good comes along <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently my 18 month old has started repeating words so much more clearly.... makes me so happy! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. Your kiddo will be talking your ear off in no time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have done my grocery yesterday. I didn't pay for a chocolate bar. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Man, that sucks. Are you going to go back and return it or did you eat it already? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't eat yet but I can't return it. <endOfText>
<human> I say in that case don't worry about it. Mistakes happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this one time when my family was on a roadtrip and we got lost in the middle of no where at night. <endOfText>
<human> That should have been scary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I just saw I got a high score on my last test despite not studying enough (or so I thought). <endOfText>
<human> It mean that you are smart. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received my first check from my first job yesterday. I am happy. I am finally financially independent. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I know that is an amazing feeling to have. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a similar situation when I was trying to catch a softball and ran smack dab into a fence. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, I bet that must have hurt! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It did indeed. For the next few weeks I was too scared to even try and catch another ball. <endOfText>
<human> That could be some trauma there... but I am sure you will get back into the swing of things (no pun intended). <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to go to a work picnic today, but it didn't happen thanks to rain. <endOfText>
<human> That is unfortunate. Did they reschedule the picnic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big exam coming up next week, and yet I feel totally prepared for it. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Good luck! That attitude says a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate moved out a month ago and decided to travel across the country living out of his SUV that he outfitted into a bedroom. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's a bold move. How is he getting along with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i come from a large mexican family my little niece just speaks spanish, she just starte kinder and with a few months already she was speaking english sure its sounds broken but i was still astonished <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I'm a native spaker, but from what I understand English is very hard to actually learn <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> maybe little kids just learn faster , she gets home and starts counting and saying the a, b ,cs in english <endOfText>
<human> They absolutely do. Kids are like sponged. It's been said that it's much easier for kids to learn multiple languages than adults <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied really hard for my exam, and I think I'll do well! <endOfText>
<human> what kind of exam is it , and you sound confident you got this  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what kind of exam is it , and you sound confident you got this <endOfText>
<human> It's actually a Master's exam so it covers a lot of material, but I do feel I learned it well and am confident in my abilities <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So when I was in grade 12, my friends and I competed in school math contest. I still was not feeling so confident because I was having a hard time fitting in the school. But that day I solved 4 out of 5 questions given during the contest and my team won. And from that day on until I finished the school I felt a little more recognized and quite a bit more confident. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! You must have felt so proud of your achievements. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I did! <endOfText>
<human> That's good. I was never very good at math in school. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling rather anxious the other day because I smoked a ton of pot <endOfText>
<human> Were you doing it in a public place? Weed can do that to someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am fat. I feel ashame when I have to change clothes in the men locker room. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad.  Have you given serious thought to trying to lose weight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate just passed his driving license test. I was not expecting him to pass it the first time he takes it. But he did it <endOfText>
<human> Wow good for him. Now he can drive you around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The situation was very unfair and I was treated as if I didn't matter after working there for over 5 years <endOfText>
<human> Wow im sorry to hear that. It sucks when something goes wrong at a job you've been there long <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a gift for a friend and it says it was delivered but I never received it. Now the company says it takes 14 days for a refund <endOfText>
<human> Don't you hate how "customer service" has no service anymore?  Did you get the refund at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could live in 60's. It seems that during that period life was easier. <endOfText>
<human> What makes life so hard right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love Marvel and DC, but i'm not so sure I should join the Comic Book Club at school. <endOfText>
<human> Why you don't want to join the comic book club? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wab blessed enough to be able to see two of my daughters graduate from high school. I couldn't be more happy for them. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's wonderful!  Tell them congratulations for me! You must be bursting with pride!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that's wonderful!  Tell them congratulations for me! You must be bursting with pride! <endOfText>
<human> I sure am! They are so excited to be starting a great new chapter in their lives. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking at pictures of when I got engaged and can't believe how time has flown by, 14 years later. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! Time really does fly by, doesn't it? What was your favorite moment from it all/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My exams are coming up soon and will be studying a lot for them. I would like get a good grade. <endOfText>
<human> Well studying is a good place to start. Do you feel confident about how well you will do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving my car all day and really needed the gas money <endOfText>
<human> oh that sucks, were you able to get anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I got the 40.00 tip from a customer <endOfText>
<human> wow that's great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the mall and when I got back to my car, it wouldn't start. I know nothing about cars and didn't know what to do besides calling my husband. Thankfully he was able to figure it out <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad he was able to help.  Was the battery dead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in Canada, but I like a Nigerian man <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, long distance is hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know, but I had been talking to him since March 2017, It is already July 2018. <endOfText>
<human> Have you met in person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a rough time in the hospital back in march of last year. I got pretty sick and was stuck in there for a week. <endOfText>
<human> So sorry to hear that. What happened? Is it something serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner decided to visit her parents for a week who live out of city. Now i do not have anybody to talk to and feel lonely <endOfText>
<human> Hey bro. or sis......you are talking to me now.....hope it helps some. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an unexpected emergency pop up and I couldn't make it in to cover him.I felt really bad for not being able to cover him. <endOfText>
<human> Did he get mad at you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I went to the beach with my family and it reminded me of building castles in the sand as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to go to places that make you feel younger again, it brings back good memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to play a lot of Mario kart and I am very confident in my skills <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! What system do you play it on? I haven't played Mario Kart since the Wii. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents surprised me with a trip up to see me for 4 days. I was so shocked and am so happy they are here! <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful! I love those 'surprise visit' occassions. Sadly my parents would need to fly across the country to do that and it's just not feasible given my work schedule <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a horror movie with my friends and I got really scared <endOfText>
<human> Eeeek! I can't watch those anymore like I used to when I was a teenager. I bet you got scared!  Those replay in my mind over and over. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a huge scaredy-cat. I just can't take them since they give me nightmares. Ugh. <endOfText>
<human> Once, I was watching a horror movie a loooong time ago and the phone was ringing in the movie and then didn't work all of a sudden and then it happened to me and my friend in real life right at the same time! It was crazy but it was just a storm outside. ha ha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this one time that a really rude customer yelled at my workplace. I was really not having it. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just broke up with my girlfriend of 4 years. She left the apartment to me. I'm all by myself. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. Do you enjoy having the apartment to yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I bought a five dollar lottery ticket. i didn't expect to win anything but I ended up winning five hundred dollars. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I'm actually really jealous. How did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> seeing your love one dying frightened me. I cant control myself to think about it. <endOfText>
<human> What even made you think about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well, for one I am not prepared and for two this is the first time I felt this. <endOfText>
<human> Think of positive thinks instead, you have control over that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell for my ex again. He knows how to get to me. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, don't you hate when that happens. What did he promise you this time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Game of thrones is about to end. I can't believe they are going to do this to me! <endOfText>
<human> Right!? One of the best shows of all time in my opinion, what are we suppose to do with our time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cared for my grandfather the last months of his life, I really enjoyed taking care of him <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. I bet he appreciated it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spoke with numerous active and reserve personnel about their basic training experiences.  There wasn't much positive in what they shared so my mind wallowed in what lay ahead.  Naturally I was worried to say the least. <endOfText>
<human> Are you enrolling into army? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These were the experiences I had before I went into basic training. <endOfText>
<human> Well good luck, its a tough life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am about to start college at the end of the month. <endOfText>
<human> That's a big time in someone's life.  Do you feel ready for this new phase? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am from Tennessee and moving to Oregon. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that is a long way.  Do you have family visits planned so you have something to look forward to and help you get through? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom says she will but I think I'm going to transfer after a year. Its too far. <endOfText>
<human> You might fall in love with it and end up sticking it out.  You never know, but leaving family is hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is graduating from medical school this month. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! What an accomplishment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was little my grandma gave me a little ceramic cat. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, what kind of cat was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a friend on facebook that posted a weird meme of someone mixing milk , nes quick and maya and swore its so good ... i almost threw up in my mouth <endOfText>
<human> I just almost threw up a bit when you described it to me.  So I understand <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh man it was so nasty , i did not think that was a thing <endOfText>
<human> I cannot imagine anyone wanting to drink that without losing a bet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently was in a situation at work where I had a colleague take credit for months of my work, and go out of their way to tell my boss and others in a committee that I actually held the team back. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh I hate crap like that.  Why can't credit be shared?  Does it always have to be so cutthroat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Honestly, I'm indifferent as to how it's shared. Later, my boss actually sat me down and told me they knew my colleague was out of line. Ironically, their contract with our company was up two weeks later and they weren't renewed. <endOfText>
<human> Well All's well that ends well.  I'm sure glad they were able to see through such a cheap ploy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite time of year is the holidays. I get to see my family that I miss so much during the year. <endOfText>
<human> Holidays are a great time for family. I love that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset with my kids. <endOfText>
<human> What did they do this time? Kids are always getting into stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss at my old job was nice enough to put in a good word for me at a new organization and helped me land a higher paying job! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! It really pays not to burn bridges, you never know when someone from your past can help you out like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate half a sandwich before realizing the bread was old and moldy! It was gross! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I can imagine how you must have felt when you realized.  Did you get sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished moving and got charged double what I was quoted by the moving company! <endOfText>
<human> That is not cool. I sure hope they fix their mess up quick! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm furious, I was almost killed by a semi-truck because he just randomly merged into my lane without looking! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Was anyone hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is headed to high school. I am nervous. <endOfText>
<human> That's a very stressful time in a person's life, but I'm sure she'll adapt! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to do much better this semester than last. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you have a good plan for success this semester.  Did you pass last semester? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother is moving into a retirement community in town after 30 years of living in another state.  I can't wait to be able to visit her all the time! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid, my house was hit by a tornado, I was scared to death! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did you and your family do? Was the house damaged? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend was feeling nauseous this morning and thinks she's pregnant. She went to get tested, and I am praying that she isn't. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine you are nervous.  What will you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just hired an exterminator last week for silverfish.  Now we have them worse than ever! <endOfText>
<human> I have never heard of silverfish, but if you have to hire an exterminator that sounds serious. I hope you are ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY neighbors have been moving in for a month <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is a long time. Why is it taking so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know but they bring in furniture almost every day. And they do it late at night. It;s annoying <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty annoying for sure. I hope they get moved in so they stop bothering you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got into watching golf on TV. I am so amazed at how good some of the pro players are. <endOfText>
<human> Golf? I could never get into it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ave the worst mailman <endOfText>
<human> That's no good.  What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just retired and feel truly happy for the first time in my life. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I can't wait to retire and travel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's so much better than you can even imagine. <endOfText>
<human> Are you goig to travel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i did jiu jitsu for 3 years , and now my brother and his wife have done jiu jitsu for 1 year , and the other day i was in shock when they enrolled my 3 year old nephew into jiu jitsu too ... omg the kids gonna be a monster <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to start them young! Hopefully they love it and stick to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope the kid stays with it too, it will give him a lot of discipline and useful skills in life like self confidense <endOfText>
<human> I agree. Kids can get a lot more out of sticking to those types of sports other than just physical exercise. It teaches them great personality traits like dedication and hard work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While visiting the zoom, I noticed some of the workers going into a panic and then they began running. I learned later that lion had escaped it's enclosure! <endOfText>
<human> omg that is so scary , especially if you took all your little ones with you that day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got locked out of my house today because I forgot my key. I called my parents and they were mad at me. <endOfText>
<human> It happens. Maybe you should hide one somewhere in case you get locked out again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was excited when my kid asked to try out for cheerleading. She practiced hard and made the team. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome for your kid! Now she knows hard work pays off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father is going to give me a watch that has been passed down for 3 generations! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds pretty special. Are you his only child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My power lifting coach bench pressed 650 pounds for 3 reps. I couldn't believe my eyes! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! He houldl do competitions. I have only seen that on TV <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought some milk today. My kids love cereal! <endOfText>
<human> I love cereal too. What type do your kids enjoy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a lot of  money at the casino <endOfText>
<human> Always gamble in moderation, how much did you lose? Enough to get the hubby mad?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Always gamble in moderation, how much did you lose? Enough to get the hubby mad? <endOfText>
<human> If I had a husband he would leave me. That much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been single for the past year. <endOfText>
<human> How did it feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends from high school decided to gather and have dinner together. I was the only one left out. So disappointed in them <endOfText>
<human> That's kind of rude for them not to invite you. You should tell them you were hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing makes me mad like when people leave their grocery carts in the middle of the parking lot. How inconsiderate is that? <endOfText>
<human> True. i think the store should introduce some policies for punishing such individuals with fines <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that my girlfriend has been cheating on me. <endOfText>
<human> He sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid to send my 3 year old to daycare. <endOfText>
<human> Why? Is there something wrong with the daycare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work I am the most confident man ever, maybe because I've worked there so long. <endOfText>
<human> There's nothing wrong with that. Unless you're mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took like 200 dollars worth of clothes to the counter at macys <endOfText>
<human> Wow, and you just walked out the store with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my old house in Orlando <endOfText>
<human> Thats sad to hear. Do you have any old pictures of it that you could look at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got locked out of my house today and couldn't shower despite being really sweaty. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.Are you still locked out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so alone these days <endOfText>
<human> Why? I will be your friend if you need friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kid is going to be all dolled up on the first day of school <endOfText>
<human> Really?? Are you over-protective of your kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to buy a house, but I didn't have enough credit history to get approved. <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry. Ask some help from your friends and family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY son stayed over a friends house las week <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? Was it his first sleep over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Jack N The Box the other day, and there was a long gray hair in my burger! <endOfText>
<human> I have never had that. We don't have them here. Good thing though lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, i saw my neighbor litter the driveway with chocolate bar package when he finished eating it. I was disgusted by his act <endOfText>
<human> Did you tell him anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a sad thing to hear. I hope you are happy to be rid of them both now <endOfText>
<human> Why was it sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because my life changed so much. I lost my best friend and my boyfriend at the same time. <endOfText>
<human> My condolences, I hope you are doing alright now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i did not get to go with my friend to the concert, so i went by myself. worse decision ever . Should of just stayed home <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why was it so bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little brother just got into college! <endOfText>
<human> woohooo i bet you are super excited <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't afford this dress I want for a wedding I have to attend. I tried to save up for it but it didn't work out for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Can you find a different, less expensive dress? Or borrow one from a friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends randomly stopped by to check on me as I had been feeling bad <endOfText>
<human> Friends sometimes have a sixth sense for that sort of thing, don't they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> life is so good. I have everything i need, i have a great job, wonderful wife and a beautiful baby boy <endOfText>
<human> Congrats. Enjoy it and keep yourself grateful. It's easy to take things for granted sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling happy I have money saved up. <endOfText>
<human> that's great! Sometimes it's kind of hard to save up money but it's good to have something saved up when things get bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my cat room, turtle cage and everything else clean yesterday. I went in to the day hoping to get all of it done and I did. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! I wish I was more productive sometimes. It would really make my life easier <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat decided to scratch my face as I was trying to give him a bath <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I've been there! I looked like a person who cut when I used to give a lot of cat baths! Did you clean it right away? (cat scratch fever) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, have you ever used a robot before? <endOfText>
<human> No I have not? I think it might be fun though. Have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is wanting to take a job in another state. <endOfText>
<human> Is it a really good job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super ticked at people who just want to make everything upsetting for everyone else. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean by that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I'm even sharing this with anyone because I want to forget it but earlier I was walking around the office with my dress shoved in my underwear! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I've been there. That is hard. I hope it wasn't too long! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a wide open window and screen right next to my driveway because someone broke it the other day when I wasn't home. <endOfText>
<human> did they steal anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i can afford groceries now when before i could not even buy soup <endOfText>
<human> I have been there! Isn't it nice to feel secure even if for a little bit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found $50 in my desk drawer at work. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were really excited. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a flighty yesterday and there was a baby crying all the way for 2 hours. <endOfText>
<human> pretty annoying jeez <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i lost lots of weight, i can walk around with my shirt off and open now. So proud of myself that i'm not a fatso anymoe <endOfText>
<human> Good work. You must be feeling so healthy and fresh. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the mall yesterday and saw my ex with a new guy. <endOfText>
<human> That's hard. Was it a bad breakup? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very scared when my mom went in the hospital and was going to have surgery. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, was the surgery successful? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got promoted and I've been at my job forever and still didn't get a promotion. kind of jealous a little bit <endOfText>
<human> That's sucks, you should quit if they don't appreciate you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My duck is getting on my nerves a bit. He is a big fat guy and screams all the time if he feels he hasn't had enough food. <endOfText>
<human> You have a pet duck? That's nuts! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why is it so hard to make friends as an adult? No one seems to like me and it's discouraging. <endOfText>
<human> It is hard! Maybe they aren't right then. So many people are just not trustworthy. What have you tried? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read a horror story last night. <endOfText>
<human> Which one?  Was it good?  I've read a decent amount of those, but I'm always looking for more. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a class tomorrow that I am excited about. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's fun to hear. What kind of class is it? Are you teaching, or a student, or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom brought home some cheesecake for my little brother, because he did well on his test the other day. Cheesecake is my favorite. I snuck about half of the portion and ate it, and I feel bad. I couldn't resist... <endOfText>
<human> That is a whole lot of nutrition! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend got back with her ex boyfriend <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I take it that you aren't happy about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to win a reward at work. I worked hard for it <endOfText>
<human> That is always nice when your hard work finally pays off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a trip to disneyland. <endOfText>
<human>  HOW SWEET.. HAVE A GREAT TRIP  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> HOW SWEET.. HAVE A GREAT TRIP <endOfText>
<human> I know I can't wait! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I KNOW .. IT WOULD BE IN TRIGUING .. BY THE WAY , IS IT YOUR FIRST EVER TIRP <endOfText>
<human> I haven't been there since I was a child. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> HEY... WHAT ARE YOUR HOBBIES <endOfText>
<human> Hunting, fishing and computers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends invited me to go to the movies with them after work! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really fun. Are you going to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I auditioned for a spot on the LA Kings Ice girls team. <endOfText>
<human> Oh? That's pretty interesting! How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel upset that someone I know would throw away progress constantly. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered my kids school supplies pretty late this year <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Well they have a lot of great deals online right now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very protective of the new dog I got in. She was very abused and is just a puppy! <endOfText>
<human> Thats a sad thing to hear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy with my new home <endOfText>
<human> I am glad! Tell me about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling trepidation about payday this week. <endOfText>
<human> How come? Is something wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Resting in my bed in the morning is a great feeling, I feel so at ease when I don't have to rush to be anywhere. <endOfText>
<human> I would love that! Give me that feeling :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to put my dog down, she's so sick. I don't know how I am going to cope with this. <endOfText>
<human> I have had to do this too with my best friends (My beloved dogs). It is hard. I know how you feel because I have been there more times then I want to remember.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have had to do this too with my best friends (My beloved dogs). It is hard. I know how you feel because I have been there more times then I want to remember. <endOfText>
<human> How do you get through it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sad that someone I know chooses to not take ahold of their life and have a better one. <endOfText>
<human> Well, it is almost the fact of life that irresponsible people will not last much and regret will be only consequence for them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am concerned that the prices for everyday products will rise with President Trump threatening tariffs against China <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way! Prices have already risen on a lot including for people selling things in certain states. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a bit shocked that someone was so nice this morning after being so rotten yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? It's always a bit suspicious when someone just changes their attitude like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost stepped on a snake today. <endOfText>
<human> Did the snake try to strike at you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No he didn't. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you didn't get bit! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rode in an airplane for the first time last week, and I have never been so frightened. <endOfText>
<human> My first time was scary too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy my kids are hetting out of the house and going back to school. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! My sister is happy about that too, she has 4 daughters. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds hectic! <endOfText>
<human> It is. But its almost over now lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved by myself to Spain to study. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really interesting! How do you like it so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store and someone stole my purse. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get a good look at the guy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been applying for new jobs but, I haven't found one yet <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I'm sure you find one soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom was very sick a few years ago, and I took care of her while she was bed ridden. <endOfText>
<human> She's lucky to have such a great kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks! I was happy to take care of her. Its the least we can do as children. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly, we have to return the favor since they put up with us when we were little. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never been more reafy for school to start. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, me either! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got cut off in traffic today and I almost hit someone because of it. It made me so angry! <endOfText>
<human> I bet it did! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been with my boyfriend for nine years now <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! How is it going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Exactly. I realized yesterday he does that all the time. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried counseling, reading going through a program? Are there good things? I know it is hard when a partner doesn't work on a relationship and keep it good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really glad I have money saved up. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Are you saving for something specific? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so afraid I will forget my lines during the play. <endOfText>
<human> What play are you doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when my wife brought home our new tortoise <endOfText>
<human> Did she surprise you with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son has been cleaning up after himself without being asked, it's been such a joy to see him take initiative! <endOfText>
<human> wow i wish i could get my kids to do that. congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The person buying my house wanted to move in before closing date. <endOfText>
<human> Is that something they can do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If you let them yes, just worrisome. <endOfText>
<human> Can they move in and then not actually buy the house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The year at school is going to be great! <endOfText>
<human> Thats a good outlook to have! What year are you on 1st, 2nd?  <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I wanted to take friday off but, I'm unable too. <endOfText>
<human> Did you already make plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it made me happy to see my son had perfect attendance all school year <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  You must be an excellent parent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog had to be euthanized last week. <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that.. what happened ?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sorry to hear that.. what happened ? <endOfText>
<human> He was very old and had complications.  I am hurting so bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm unable to clear my exam. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have a hard time in the class itself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss when my toddlers were little tiny babies. <endOfText>
<human> did you take lots of pictures? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for my new raise to kick in! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I wish I could get a raise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was looking at pictures of my kids the other day and got a little sad <endOfText>
<human> S it because they are getting bigger? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a half pound of turkey at the deli. That is not what I got. <endOfText>
<human> did you get more or less ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh wow.. thats horrible.. our butcher gives you a sample before slicing.. i find this the best way to verify <endOfText>
<human> I Will do that next time for sure. The kids were bothering me so I wasn't paying attention. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The abused dog I took in is finally RUNNING and playing. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's great! You did a great thing by taking in a scared animal! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is taking me on a cruise! She's never done anything like this for me before! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Make sure to always stay with her, cruise ships are HUGE <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was a very hard day, in addition to drama, I felt so alone. <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry to hear that :( What happened? I'm here for you if you wanna talk <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you tried seeing a specialist? Or if you are religious to talk to the pastor? <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know what to do, They aren't here anymore but it is still hard. Somethings in life are hard no matter what. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, i thought i saw a ghost outside my window!! <endOfText>
<human> no way!!! I hope you left the house!! I would, and probably would never come back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sometimes i trust my relatives a little too much when i shouldnt <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is thinking about divorcing me. <endOfText>
<human> does she have valid reasons ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into a small fender bender. the car wasn't damaged, just a tiny scratch! I was shocked when collision center told me it would cost 526$ to fix that tiny scratch <endOfText>
<human> Wow!  I hate when things like that happen.  I had a similar thing where they would have to replace the whole front body for a small scratch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad yesterday when i saw someone had put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> I sorry the hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't made any friends since I moved out here. <endOfText>
<human> what have you tried doing to meet new people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a bit envious of my friends <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter snuck out of the house last night on a school night! I could punish her for the rest of her life! <endOfText>
<human> How old is she? I havent experienced that yet with my daughter <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a surprise visit to my grandma home. <endOfText>
<human> Does she live on her own? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke my window to my cat room and pushed in the screen. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, How did happen?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, How did happen? <endOfText>
<human> I do not know. Someone in my neighborhood did it. Bad neighborhood. It makes me furious more than anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really think this year is going to end great, and be one for the record books. <endOfText>
<human> how so ? moneywise ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Moneywise yes for sure, but also just in general being happy. I guess money is happiness right now for me. <endOfText>
<human> i hear that  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters bearded dragon the other day <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun but I would be scared. I heard they are friendly tho. First time taking care of it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like fun but I would be scared. I heard they are friendly tho. First time taking care of it? <endOfText>
<human> they are friendly once they get to know you.. but when they tense up their spikes can hurt sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kids in my neighborhood put dog poop on my front stoop, how nasty. <endOfText>
<human> Eww. That is disgusting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always forget my password on websites <endOfText>
<human> You need to write them down! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was on the A honor roll all last year. <endOfText>
<human> Congradulations  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congradulations <endOfText>
<human> Thank you.  I am so pleased with his performance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my car keys and someone returned them to the bar. <endOfText>
<human> That must be a relief. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset that I have been used for so long. <endOfText>
<human> by whom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other day <endOfText>
<human> I understand that feeling! Was it late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling strange about payday. It is a stressful time <endOfText>
<human> I know. So many bills, so little funds. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got cable again. I was upset because I couldnt find anything to watch <endOfText>
<human> Oh lol! I know, that is why I only watch stuff on the computer. More control over it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got angry with my superior. <endOfText>
<human> What was the reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son made me breakfast in bed today, I'm so glad he's my son <endOfText>
<human> Pretty good! how old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently lost some weight. <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  How did you go about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't get big companies who think they can take advantage of everyone. <endOfText>
<human> Are you talking about ones that just raise and raise prices? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I may be able to get my new car by the end of the week! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What kind of car is it and what color? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't decided on what I want just yet! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well if you can get it soon you might want to start researching :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had plans to go see a new movie with my sister but she had to cancel. I was really looking forward to our night out. <endOfText>
<human> What movie were you planning on seeing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my grandmother passed away, I was so heartbroken, I was not old enough to be prepared for it <endOfText>
<human> I don't think we are ready at any age to lose someone we love. I am so sorry about your Grandmother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I had a huge cart full and was waiting in like forever, a new line opend up and the cashier called me over but someone cut me in line! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I would have been so made, did you say anything to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I didnt because I avoid drama, but my facial expression said it all. On top of that I had a fussy baby with me.. the nerve of ppl! <endOfText>
<human> Some people on think about themselves! I would have said something if he didn't look the fighting type.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> An ex girlfriend of mine was in a bind and needed a place to stay.  She repaid me by wetting the bed last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow.... a grown woman wetting the bed? Does she do it on purpose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently was very shocked and happy to find my husband had cleaned the entire house <endOfText>
<human> That was sweet of him!  Were you shocked because that's something that never happens? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am appreciative of my family, although sometimes they really get on my last nerve <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel. That's everyone' family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a 100 on my last test. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, did you study a lot for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared about my upcoming job interview, I have not interviewed in years <endOfText>
<human> It's really easy if you think of it as a relative you don't really want to talk to, polite and to the point <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out of work for a long time due to my company laying off. <endOfText>
<human> Oh No, how long were you out of work for?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh No, how long were you out of work for? <endOfText>
<human> It was almost 7 months, but I finally got hired somewhere else. Time to celebrate! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got upset and blamed my daughter for something, only to find out it wasnt her fault. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I bet you felt bad. I am sure she forgave you though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well shes still little so luckily yes, had she been a teen probably woulda taken a few days. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. We all make mistakes sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was missing my family back home. <endOfText>
<human> how often do you visit them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am disappointed by Nintendo, they announced a direct but only for one game, when they usually announce many new ones <endOfText>
<human> They announce a direct? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They're buying everyone shakes today at work. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like shakes? Where are they from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait for the new Super Smash Bros, it is only a few months away now <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah what game system do you play that on?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah what game system do you play that on? <endOfText>
<human> It will be for the Nintendo Switch! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So some parents might react differently but im quite proud of my daughter, she peed on the floor and came to show me what she did. Its the thought that counts. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me mad, do you have carpet or hardwood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its carpet, it didnt bother me because shes in potty training stage and I am just glad she came to show me she did it so she realized it was wrong! ( lol ) <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well that is a good start then! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good Morning, for my job I review candidates and the one I had recently was far and away the best one I have ever interviewed <endOfText>
<human> That is great, did you offer them the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Old pokemon games make me nostalgic and emotional for some odd reason, they were a big part of my childhood <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow Red and Blue were the best gameboy games <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disappointed in the new Mario Tennis game, but it was not the biggest letdown <endOfText>
<human> Sorry, I have not played it myself.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry, I have not played it myself. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, usually Nintendo does a great job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not looking forward to my job interview, I do not want to do poorly <endOfText>
<human> You are going to nail it I bet. When is it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You are going to nail it I bet. When is it? <endOfText>
<human> I am not sure exactly yet, I just got asked to interview <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One night my neighbor wrote to me and said he wanted to buy my house. :o <endOfText>
<human> What did you say to that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I said yesssssss! Its been on the market forever so I was shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congrats then, glad it worked out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just took delivery of a Tesla S! I have put a lot of faith into the auto pilot function! I hope it never fails me! <endOfText>
<human> It's failed before. Just make sure you keep your hands on the wheel.... just in case. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran a mile in under 6 minutes for the first time <endOfText>
<human> What!  That seems really fast!  Did you train alot?  That is amazing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad when i lie to my parents, even though I am an adult now <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, same thing.  They've done so much for me that I just feel bad doing things against them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of my girlfriend for getting a full time job, I am sur she will do great! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome i bet she will too! when does she start?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats awesome i bet she will too! when does she start? <endOfText>
<human> She starts in exactly a week <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new state, new home.. looking so forward to the holidays this year! <endOfText>
<human> Are you gonna go home for the holidays? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, this is my home now.. just cant wait to decorate and have a beach like christmas instead of snow! <endOfText>
<human> Ah that makes sense, I love snow myself, but to each their own! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always thought android phones were trash. <endOfText>
<human> Really? I guess there a lot of people that think that as well. Do you still think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to love playing the old pokemon games, I still bust them out every once in awhile for a throwback <endOfText>
<human> Yes, It's very classic game.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, It's very classic game. <endOfText>
<human> That is true, I just am really into it, I like collecting and animals, so great fit <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lose my confidence about my career slowly. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a trip to las vegas. <endOfText>
<human> Is it fully paid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping the new Pokemon game ends up being really good, I am not sure though <endOfText>
<human> I am also not sure about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get annoyed by my job sometimes, but at the end of the day it pays my bills <endOfText>
<human> I agree, most jobs are painful but necessary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my Dad would play catch with me. <endOfText>
<human> Why does that no longer happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my  temper the other day and said things I shouldnt have said. I let the stress get the best of me. <endOfText>
<human> Who did you say that to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> to my wife. ugh bad mistake. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, better apologize quickly there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ashamed of myself for being lazy and not going to the gym, I am not sure why I struggle with it <endOfText>
<human> Same.. for me its because i work so much, and being a parent is so draining for me... i bought a new machine tho im going to start working out on friday. Try to find out whats causing it for you, and take 1 step to fix it you got this!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Same.. for me its because i work so much, and being a parent is so draining for me... i bought a new machine tho im going to start working out on friday. Try to find out whats causing it for you, and take 1 step to fix it you got this! <endOfText>
<human> That is what I will try, I just keep making excuses <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when I was gifted a car for my graduation gift! <endOfText>
<human> Well, that's great! What a wonderful surprise too! I bet you really appreciated it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am angry that my brother ruined a movie ending for me, that is such a rude move <endOfText>
<human> That is a jerk move.   What movie was it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I crashed my truck today. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, how did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am impressed by the idea of the Nintendo Switch, it seems really cool and seamless <endOfText>
<human> I like it too, what is your favorite game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will never forget the feeling I felt on September 11th, 2001 <endOfText>
<human> I was a kid then, but I remember my teachers reaction <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trusting of my girlfriend, I did not think that was something that would happen for me <endOfText>
<human> What happened in the past to make you so hesitant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After moving away for college I was by myself alot <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sounds lonely :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going skydiving tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Oh how exciting, by yourself or with a group? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldnt believe it when my son started walking at 5 months of age <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, sounds like he's ahead of f the curve. You must be proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend died in a helicopter crash <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really looking forward to eating dinner later. <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Telemarketers always call at the most inconvenient times <endOfText>
<human> They do i hate that, i dont know why but i always get them while in a call <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was susprised when my parents let me get my license the day I turned 16, that is not really like them <endOfText>
<human> Well at 16 you have experienced alot of life and are ready to move on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my grandmother passed away, I was devestated, I hated it so much <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I am sorry for your loss <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devasted when I didnt earn the promotion <endOfText>
<human> What is the job you were trying to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been faithful to my girlfriend of almost 3 years <endOfText>
<human> That's is a really good thing, it helps build trust in a relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get good feelings thinking about my childhood and all the friends I used to have <endOfText>
<human> Oh, tell me more! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> Have you considered tring to work out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my lunch at home two days in a row. <endOfText>
<human> that is bad, are there other options? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been faithful to my girlfriend of almost 3 years <endOfText>
<human> thats great, thats how you should be <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The a/c in my house wasn't working this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Is it hot where you live? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> not too bad right now but it gets really hot <endOfText>
<human> I get that, I am sure it is not fun regardless <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is super smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> No need to be jealous, I am sure you are much better than him in certain areas. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am nervous about my upcoming job interview, it has been awhile <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you. I am always nervous at interviews. Don't worry, I'm sure you will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a stranger on the side of the road who needed a ride. <endOfText>
<human> Did you help them out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone the other day when my dog ran away <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you fnd your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend told me that he thought the girl that works at the gas station is cute. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bit rude if you ask me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was terrible and it made me feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> I can see why. Some people just don't know when to keep things to themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was hoping to get out on time last week and it didnt work out <endOfText>
<human> That stinks. When did you get out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get the gift my daughter wanted for her birthday <endOfText>
<human> What did she want? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was irked when i saw my cousin coming inside the house <endOfText>
<human> Why were you irked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am confident about my new job, and I can not wait to get started! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, what field do you work in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister graduated with an MBA. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome, what is she doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I just put a bid on a house we really want! We are fairly optimistic that we will get it! <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! I hope it goes well for you :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, we don't know for sure, but it looks promising! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I make sure to make my wife dinner every night. <endOfText>
<human> thats nice of you, what does she like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my ex-girlfriend on a date with my best friend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. I'm sorry. Do you still have a cordial relationship with your ex? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never get to go to the movies. <endOfText>
<human> That's no fun. Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents won the lottery last week. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome, i bet they are thrilled <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker can be really aggravating. He is constantly talking and asking me dumb questions! I can never get anything done in peace! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That sounds so irritating. Have you tried talking to your boss about him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really nervous about work tomorrow! I am supposed to be presenting at a meeting in front of upper management and feel uneasy. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I'd be really nervous too. But I know you can do it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked a girl on a date and got turned down last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife threw me a big birthday party without me knowing. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like such a thoughtful surprise! Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in gum someone spit on the sidewalk. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible! Did you get it off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never finished college <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  Neither did I.   I know how you feel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally tripped while walking into a restaurant and there was a bunch of people around. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible, i would have cried! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog did great at training class! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, what kind of dog is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a slacker coworker that drives me crazy he gets to work late everyday and does the minimum to get by <endOfText>
<human> Is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is the boss aware or does he seem to skate by unnoticed? <endOfText>
<human> she is aware but doesn't feel the need to do anything about it. that's what makes it worse <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ive got a big interview on Friday. It for a job I really want. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it goes well! are you prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep my dads necklace close to me as much as possible. <endOfText>
<human> It's a good way to yo keep you two together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. It must be stressful. Everything will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray for better days. <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man poured a beer on me at a bar. <endOfText>
<human> I would have slapped him so fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend went on a 4 week trip around the world for his company <endOfText>
<human> Wow, How lucky! I love to travel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I called out a repairman to fix my a/c today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, your a/c isn't working?! This is a bad time of year for that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister won a bunch of money. <endOfText>
<human> Aww man.. I am sorry.  Is she at least a good person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I came home and got my mail.. and I got a check for 100$ <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing, care to share? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite pizza joint went out of business. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Do you have any alternatives? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad for my husband.  He is on the list for a lung transplant. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thats so sad. Has he been on the list long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my brother to bring me a gift from his trip. He didn't bring anything. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Maybe next time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister stole money from my wallet. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. What did you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well I started my new job this week... It is weird to be with people who don't know me <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure. But it's a fresh start. Your the new person you can make people think any thing about you that you want. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my dog to the vet today <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is there something wrong with your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did worse on an exam than I expected to. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were you prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just sitting here thinking bout long long long ago... <endOfText>
<human> What about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager keep lying to me. He is trying to advantage of me. <endOfText>
<human> Do you want to yell at him and call him a liar? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking my motorcycle out of a parking spot a couple of weeks ago and accidentally laid it on its side. I felt humiliated, especially since there were a bunch of people that saw me drop it. <endOfText>
<human> that stinks i'm sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at work and had to assist a lady with her 2 lice infected daughters <endOfText>
<human> Gross!  What did you have to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day, I was expecting to get a call from someone later on that day but they never called me. <endOfText>
<human> Who was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a raise at work. <endOfText>
<human> That is great!  It is always nice when hard work is rewarded. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my doctor yesterday and they ran some tests.  I had been feeling weak for a while now and he was concerned.  I have not heard back about the tests yet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh goodness, I hope you are okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of some of my classmates because they succeed professionally better then me. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  I think that happens to everyone, accept the one girl who became a doctor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't understand. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that.  What I wanted to say is... I am feeling mighty accomplished today.  I won my jousting tournament. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day while parked on the street someone hit my car and drove away! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's messed up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man pick his nose and eat it. <endOfText>
<human> Eww that's so gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ran upon a horrible wreck going home yesterday. One person was laying on the ground. The other girl hit her face and had blood all over it but was conscience. <endOfText>
<human> That's scary. I wonder if they made it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss fired me because i kept making him look bad. <endOfText>
<human> LOL! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so lucky to have the things I have. My 10 bedroom house, my cars, my bus <endOfText>
<human> Wow, it sounds like you have a lot to be grateful for. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is coming home from doggy day care. <endOfText>
<human> Yay!  What type of dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping to sell my house soon and move near my cousing <endOfText>
<human> Has it been on the market long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would be stressed each time it rains. I rented a place down state and Hurricane Sandy flooded our house. I can't imagine owning a place in a flood zone. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, that is it. Too stressful, but it's in a good area and someone could raise it if they wanted to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a bad day and tried calling 2 different people and couldn't get anyone <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so sorry, I'm here if you want to talk <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a big storm coming my way. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you're well prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a loud bang outside my house recently and thought someone was trying to break in. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that sounds scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the hall at school and slipped and fell. <endOfText>
<human> That can be embarrassing.  Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So... I go to church every Sunday.  I never miss. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, you must be very religious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another major life milestone today. My daughter got her driver's license! <endOfText>
<human> Watch out State Farm!  lol.  Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous.  When I get nervous I smoke too much. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah.  I just quit smoking myself.  You should try something to distract you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was smart like Albert Einstein was. <endOfText>
<human> He was certainly very intelligent, you can definitely increase your own knowledge though if you work at it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a walk yesterday and stepped in some dog poop. <endOfText>
<human> That isn't good. What did you do when you stepped in the poop? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not proud of the fact that I ate my friends pizza. <endOfText>
<human> I guess you were pretty hungry then, huh? Well, I'm sure your friend doesn't mind sharing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I go to church every sunday. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. Have you always done that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drive my dads truck! <endOfText>
<human> I've never driven a truck, only small vehicles! How's that working out for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new car was robbed last week during the night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! I really hope that you find your stuff. Do the cops have any leads? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got promoted to be a supervisor at my job. I'm so happy that my employer promoted me! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. It is always good to have some recognition for the good job done. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I'm glad that my company saw and rewarded my hardwork. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss living in the Caribbean. <endOfText>
<human> Why would you ever move away from the Caribbean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my vacation to Las Vegas. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds great, i've never been but would love to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a scratch off ticket last week! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out my brother had to get checked into rehab! I had no idea he had a problem and am quite upset over it! <endOfText>
<human> Addiction is a scary thing! I wish him the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom gave me some money to pay some bills. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of her, it's good you have such a caring mother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I was pretty confident he would pull through. <endOfText>
<human> She takes care of me the best she can. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently ran by an ad online for this online swimsuit store. It seemed to be based outside of the US so I was a bit skeptical to order from them. I ordered anyway and will wait to see what happens. <endOfText>
<human> where is it shipping from? is it a reputable store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had to assist a mom with two daughters who all had lice <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That sounds awful! What a kind thing to do though! Im sure they were very grateful for your help! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure that I will be working for NASA next year. <endOfText>
<human> Is it an engineering job or something else. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Poor little turtles keep across the highway and getting killed. I take them to the creek and one walked back up the road.. I couldn't believe it, he got killed. <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice of you to try to help the turtles. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you seen fifa world cup final? <endOfText>
<human> No I haven't  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I haven't <endOfText>
<human> I got very upset When France won. Croatia should have won. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wake up every morning and go to work. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like your job or is this something you dread? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went camping after getting all the supplies. <endOfText>
<human> Which supplies did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm moving next week and i'm unsure about everything. <endOfText>
<human> Where to? What location? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So glad to get July behind me. It was too hot to go outside most of the day. <endOfText>
<human> I hate the summer honestly, the winter is great for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog learned all of his tricks! <endOfText>
<human> Oh great. That is so fun . My baby died a few years ago. But he was over 14 , so.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh great. That is so fun . My baby died a few years ago. But he was over 14 , so. <endOfText>
<human> That is so terrible, i feel so bad for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movies and peed in my pants. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry.. my first gut reaction was to laugh a little. I really don't mean to make fun of you. That's terrible! Was it because you didn't want to miss a part of the movie, so you tried to hold it in as long as possible? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw Henry Winkler at the airport the other day! The Fonz! He came walking by, and other people were asking him for a picture. He sounded very approachable and genuine, and accommodating. I was only 30 feet from him, but I didn't want to be yet another person to ask for a picture <endOfText>
<human> I have never been to an airport honestly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend is always talking on the phone when we are hanging out. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe tell him how you feel about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My tree died a few weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Are you going to replace it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sold dirty underwear as new! <endOfText>
<human> That's a way to make a buck! Ebay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was riding the train today, and some guy just had an open wound, practically gushing blood. He didn't seem to really mind and everyone else seemed to just be unphased by it. I guess that's city life for you. <endOfText>
<human> I see that more in the country I guess. That would be horrifying. But maybe he is just immune to pain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I learned about Neurofeedback today. <endOfText>
<human> Neurofeedback? I don't even know what that is! Could you fill me in a little bit? And why did you need to learn about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through old photographs of when my children were young. <endOfText>
<human> oh i love looking at old photos <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> me too! It seems like it was only yesterday they were babies now they are all young adults. <endOfText>
<human> my nieces and nephews are all growing up on me and my step kids are almost adults too. it goes by in a blink of an eye <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i found a pyrex bowl at the store like one my mom used to have <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!! I love pyrex stuff. I bet it brought back many memories.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow!! I love pyrex stuff. I bet it brought back many memories. <endOfText>
<human> it did. i remember watching the cheese bubble up on the top when she made tuna casserole thinking how much longer is this going to take. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its funny how items can bring back such good memories. <endOfText>
<human> it does. i wish the set wasn't $40 i would've bought it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ate my shoes! <endOfText>
<human> I hope they weren't expensive shoes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't want to go back to school. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. I'm not ready to go back either.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear you. I'm not ready to go back either. <endOfText>
<human> I'm going to stay home because I can not take it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in a big city but I leave my car unlock. I'm really not that concerned about it getting stolen. <endOfText>
<human> I live in a small town with no car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's the way I was too and I really haven't changed since I moved and got a car. <endOfText>
<human> I want to get a car one day i think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One more week then I am off for two weeks and heading to the beach!! <endOfText>
<human> I would just go to the beach right now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I cant wait. Its one of my favorite places to go. <endOfText>
<human> Not mine at all, i enjoy my house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a free gift card from work! <endOfText>
<human>  I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it? <endOfText>
<human> It was random, so i am not sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my friends have went away to college. <endOfText>
<human> I'm in college, so i'll be your friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never new I was adopted! <endOfText>
<human> Did you just recently find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can you even believe my car broke down? <endOfText>
<human> Where that happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recommended me a restaurant. I went with my wife to try it. The food was terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should go by yourself. Normally wifes stay at home and clean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My gradma has been dead for awhile. I really miss spending time with her. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe pray and she will hear you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not really religious so I don't think she would hear me. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe she could if you tried. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Watching someone stream an old video game on Twitch, one that I used to play. It's one that's like almost 20 years old, that I used to play when I was 11. Makes me wish I didn't have so many bills and responsibilities! <endOfText>
<human> Adulting is hard that's for sure. Start playing it and streaming and make some money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thought I was going to get a vacation this year, but not going to happen. Can't get off work. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. You sound like a hard worker, which is something to be proud of, even though it's kind of wearing you out maybe. Are you able to roll the days over to next year and save them, at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family has shunned me for terrible choices I made in the past. I have no one. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the days when gas was a dollar a gallon. <endOfText>
<human> I think I'm too young for that but man wouldn't that be nice today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went into my fridge and way in the back I found a container that had be in there for quite sometime. <endOfText>
<human> Lol. Did you dare look inside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went home for my high school reunion and found out the school is closing and being sold. So sad. <endOfText>
<human> Weird.. that happened to me last year.  In Baltimore.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I score big with this lottery ticket I bought. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that would be awesome!  What are you going to spend it on?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey!  How are you?  I had a great weekend what about yourself? <endOfText>
<human> My weekend was pretty okay. Did anything special happen for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our dining room table is beat up but it belonged to my grandma so I keep it arond. <endOfText>
<human> ours is a family table too so i understand what you mean. i really need to refinish it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went out to my garden and found my tomato plants had blossom end rot <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, do you know why it could've happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared. The other night me and my friend played with a Ouija board... and it spoke to us. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. did you know the spirit you contacted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother was in the hospital really sick <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry... What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss is announcing who is being promoted tomorrow in the open position, and I just know it's me. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that sounds exciting!!  Are you ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My younger sister is getting married before I am, I can't believe it. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel negative about it, or positive? It's hard to tell from your sentence. Maybe you feel both ways. If I were in your shoes, I could see how you would start to feel some more pressure in that situation. I was always the youngest child, so I never had pressure on me to accomplish anything by a certain time. If you're not happy about it, hopefully you can turn it into a positive so that your sister doesn't get any undue negativity. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really pleased when my son came home excited about being on the honor roll <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  I bet you're a proud parent!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really am. <endOfText>
<human> Is he getting any gifts because he's done so goo?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome!  I bet you're a proud parent! <endOfText>
<human> I really am.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We took the kids fishing this weekend <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I used to take the train to work. <endOfText>
<human> Was it enjoyable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> am so thankful to come home to a nice clean home <endOfText>
<human> Did you clean the house yourself or hire someone to do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My entire family went to Europe for the summer. It is just me at the house. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds nice. How come you didn’t go with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am angry that I can not go out this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, why can't you go out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a flight and a kid kept kick the back of my chair. <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask the kid or the kid's parents to stop kicking your chair? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting my bags packed for vacation! <endOfText>
<human> Myself as well friend, i love vacation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new movie theater is opening soon. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun to go to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my girlfriend because i was cheating on her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, why did you cheat on her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have some work done on my car. Luckily the mechanic gave me a good deal. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's good.  What was wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went fishing over the weekend and made a pretty sweet catch! <endOfText>
<human> How fun. How big was your catch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movies and let out a giant fart while I was walking past some people to my seat. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, I bet that was embarrassing!!!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my goodness, I bet that was embarrassing!!! <endOfText>
<human> I was pretty humiliated, but I went up a few rows and forgot about it before the end of the movie.  When the lights came back on I was reminded of at all over again though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking in the grocery store and i fell and slipped in some spilled milk. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible.  Did you get hurt badly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just bought a jet ski. <endOfText>
<human> Must be nice!  Do you think he will let you ride it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a small leak in my water heater that I was hoping to get fixed today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sounds like a hassle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't feeling well but didn't get enough warning so I didn't make it to the bathroom in time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Happens to the best of us.  Are you feeling better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We found a huge black snake in our backyard today! Gives me the chills just thinking about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! But I think black snakes are good? They eat nasty bugs and rodents! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rescued an abandoned dog the other day, and I ended up getting an award from the ASPCA. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, what was the award for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just adopted this rescue dog. He's a sweet and timid little dachshund missing one leg. He's precious. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet.  How did he lose his leg? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I eat while I am asleep and I can't control it, but I am humiliated by it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry.  I have dealt with a lot of sleep problems and night panic attacks so I know how hard it can be dealing with things like that. I have a friend who does the same thing. Don't be humiliated.  You can't control it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone threw a bunch of trash in my yard. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh! They do that here too! Are you in a bad city too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's really amazing the amount of great doctors that write books. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, I was unaware of that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get my new vacuum tomorrow! It's been a long time since I bought one brand new. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. You have to buy a new one every so often as the motors get weak in them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think I should get on my flight in the morning. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really dramatic! What's the matter? What's making you so unsure about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I yelled at my two-year-old nephew the other day, because he wasn't paying attention and spilled something, made a huge mess. I've been yelling at him off and on recently since he started living with my family for a short period of time. It's so hard to keep my patience in the moment... But then later on I feel so terrible that I can't be a better human being to him. <endOfText>
<human> I think it's an adjustment you have to work through. Toddlers can really test anyone's patience! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't had fries in over a year. Finally got some today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! I hear you, I love them but I get sick when I eat them. Did you do okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole my lawn mower. Suffice to say...I am not a happy camper. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling lonely but settled because things are peaceful. <endOfText>
<human> Well, sometimes we can feel that way in life. Relieved because there isn't drama, but get a bit lonely. Maybe you can get out and meet some new people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend taught himself how to skate, and he just won his first competition. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats to him!  What type of skating? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't seem to get to sleep tonight, too much on my mind. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Have you been stressed about anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to visit my friend who lives an hour away in a big city, but I'm a bit nervous about driving in such a busy city. <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you. It can be scary...the more people there are- the worse they drive. Be careful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's amazing how much research goes in too helping others. <endOfText>
<human> Definitely. The world is an extremely complex thing, and I don't know if we'll ever fully understand it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would imagine that people who have certain personality types are typically drawn to becoming doctors. They all seem to be very compassionate! <endOfText>
<human> Well..I have had some terrible experiences with doctors as have many but there are some who do care about helping. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Saw a marching band pass by my work today. Kind of miss playing my flute <endOfText>
<human> That's an interesting thing to know! Have you thought about doing it as a hobby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a little bad I forgot bird food this weekend. The birds and squirrels gather on my fence line when everything is empty :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh hey! A fellow bird feeder. Did you eventually get some? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling happy I can afford what I need for the past few months. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, have you been having trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was stuck home the other day with the flu. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, the flu in summer?1 <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you! Hopefully you can avoid it this year. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god...lol- I HATE being sick...When I get sick..it's BAD- So let's hope lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a better position within my job, crossing my fingers I hear positive news! <endOfText>
<human> That is great you showed the initiative to apply.  It is common to be a bit nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a bike ride after work today.  It was very peaceful.  Just me, the mountains, and my thoughts. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds relaxing! How was the weather? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was perfect.  Not to warm, nice breeze.  Very good to release some stress. <endOfText>
<human> I love when everything just seems to work out together. Im glad you enjoyed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am lucky to have a decent paying job <endOfText>
<human> That is really good.  In this economic climate it is good to have something like that to count on.  What do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog just passed away and he was the only friend I had. <endOfText>
<human> I am so so sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so so sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it has been hard these last few days.  He had cancer, but he went pretty fast at the end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait for my cruise during Thanksgiving. <endOfText>
<human> Thats exciting! where are you going?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend died in a car accident recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!!  That is awful.  I hope you are okay :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Took my nephew fishing over the weekend <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a restaurant for mexican food with my friend and she had a roach crawl off of her salad. It was horrifying. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful. I would definitely not pay and never go back again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my husband so much. He is an amazing guy that wouldn't do anything to hurt me. <endOfText>
<human> That is so wonderful!  I have the same kind of husband.  Aren't we lucky?  It gives me hope for when my daughter grows up and finds someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was almost short on my rent this month. <endOfText>
<human> Glad you made it, what happened to almost be short? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe that Robin Williams died. <endOfText>
<human> I know. It was so shocking and sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling more positive about the future today. <endOfText>
<human> That is good!  Why have you been feeling down about the future before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into work this morning and had an unexpected bonus sitting on my desk! <endOfText>
<human> OHHH! Those are nice! How much was it if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This was a hard weekend. Second weekend alone. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you alone? did you just move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry? <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that, Miss type.  But i was going to talk about the time the my two best friends fell in love <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I entered a contest to win an ipad at work and today I got the news that I won! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That is awesome!  I don't really have much luck in winning things.  Have you won anything else before in your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have to fly across the country this coming weekend and I hate flying so much! I feel dizzy just thinking about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, good luck! Make sure to have a book/music on hand at least to help distract you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the next Star Wars movie. <endOfText>
<human> I have never seen any of the new Star Wars movies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During gym class today but pants split wide open. Everyone in the class could see my underwear. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry, were they impressed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend's dog died and she has been really upset. <endOfText>
<human> I totally feel for her. I have lost many the past year. It's hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel I can do things on my own. I didn't always feel this way, so it's nice <endOfText>
<human> Has something changed lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I did really well on my exam today <endOfText>
<human> What was the exam for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really don't want to go to the dentist next week. <endOfText>
<human> I hate the dentist. It always makes me nervous. Are you going for a checkup? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandson took his first steps the other day. Can you believe it? <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is fantastic!!!  I bet you're proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew caught a huge bass this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> That is cool, did you teach him how to fish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Spent the day yesterday just hanging out with friends and just watching shows <endOfText>
<human> that sounds like a nice sunday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today i waited for the cable company to show up at my house for 5 hours... No one ever came" <endOfText>
<human> wow thats a huge pain <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know that I will pass my driving test next week. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so! I hate driving but good luck. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've decided to ask the girl of my dreams to marry me.  I'm sure she will say yes. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Congratulations! That's exciting, and I'm sure if you're confident she will, then she will! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting older and it's hard to think on how many bad things I have experienced.\ <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry.  It sounds like you had a tough life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord, why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for Connor Mcgregor's UFC fight in October. <endOfText>
<human> How are you ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend won a lot of money the other day which was cool for him <endOfText>
<human> How did he win a lot of money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> scratcher ticket, i was quite envious <endOfText>
<human> Does he play the scratcher tickets a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe what Donald Trump said at his last rally. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea something else insane? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to the new Mexican restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> O that sounds delicious, any idea what you'll get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life can be really not a happy place. <endOfText>
<human> Sadly, I agree with you.  As I get older, it seems like that more and more.  What happened that made you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its so true! I battle chronic illness and excruciating pain daily for almost 14 years now not to mention drowning in old medical bills.  I put my faith in God and pray for relief.  Its really hard to stay optimistic.  I really hope life improves for you and you can enjoy and embrace life again. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you! I have tried..it's been a VERY traumatic year in so many ways..and I didn't think it could get any worse a few years ago..Wrong! I hear you with pain! Please try every treatment you can. DIET plays a HUGE role- also chiropractor, Nuerofeedback, Different herbs! I found eating right, exercising, herbs, vitamins, organic food helped with my pain caused by doctors- I had tons of neuropathy, pain and fibro like symptoms in addition to the trauma of deaths, abuse etc. I hope YOU feel better and YOU inspire me right now that I don't have it so bad!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is exactly what I've been going through along with horrible doctors that did nothing for me.  I just went high nutrient vegan 3 months ago and am improving my leaps and bounds.  I follow Dr. Joel Furhman.  You can keep going and your journey is giving you compassion for others that are going through horrible things.  Take heart and I hope you feel better. <endOfText>
<human> THANK YOU! That sounds GREAT! yes the raw groups on FB have good diets too! I need to do vegan as well! Just can't afford it yet. Doing Fasting with Keto WOW- That is true! I just feel tapped out after so much abuse and trauma..and losing pets and children..Just too much trauma in a short time, but I am still here! I am trying to get better, it's just a long hard journey. LOVE to you! Stay strong and kind like you are! So inspiring! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found pictures of when I was young, going camping with my grandparents. Those we such perfect times. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! It's sad yet happy to think of how great it was years ago! I hope we get to keep our good memories when we leave this world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was dancing at a wedding this weekend and I split my pants. <endOfText>
<human> How were you dancing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not looking forward to rollercoaster riding next weeked :( <endOfText>
<human> Why? Are you scared to ride it? I can relate, so if that's the case, just skip it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I see, so it's kind of a have-to scenario. Well, I always let my hubby do that, but maybe you're the hubby too lol. <endOfText>
<human> LOL no I'm the uncle!!  Oh well.  Maybe it's time I try it!  What do you think? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sure! If you've never ridden it, then you really should. <endOfText>
<human> Alrighty then!  Maybe I'll give it a shot!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a huge nail on my car's tire... horrible thing to encounter early in the morningt <endOfText>
<human> You are very lucky you didn't crash your car while driving. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to see the new James Bond movie. <endOfText>
<human> it looks like it's going to be good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, I was really very shocked and angry. <endOfText>
<human> Oh goodness, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man was chasing me down the alley last night. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh gosh! What happened. That's so terrifying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy to have my crazy family close. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good, do yall live in the same town? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I sneezed very loud next to my friend and a buger shot on her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god that’s hilarious.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my god that’s hilarious. <endOfText>
<human> I was petrified.  I was really crushing on her too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate moved out, it is just me now living at the house. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what caused them to move out?  Is that a good thing or a bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling ill and fatigued the last couple months and just found out that I'm pregnant. Wasn't expecting that! <endOfText>
<human> Do you have any children already or will this be your first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog always barks when I am on the phone. <endOfText>
<human> That is irritating, huh.  It is like a kid that can't stand not having the attention for a minute so they act up.  Haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a hair in my soup at lunch today. I was not happy. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didn't drink the soup. They better of given you the meal for free. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared that World War 3 may be near. <endOfText>
<human> Nah.  Don't worry my friend!  It will be okay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew plays football this year.  So proud of him! <endOfText>
<human> What position does your nephew play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was so much irritated. I loudly screamed on my bother. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Two days left before the trip, I was beside myself. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you go? You went alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should of got a degree in computer science, my friend just graduated and is making 30 grand more than me! <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy! what was your original major? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am in the middle of a contract dispute and I don't know what is going to happen. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good, what is the contract dispute about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever been to Niagara Falls? I just went and it blew my mind on the size of it! <endOfText>
<human> I haven't been.  I would really love to go, and it's good to hear such a good review from someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on any exams in school. <endOfText>
<human> Good for YOU! Integrity is very rare nowadays <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw some old pics on FB of my dog who is passed and my niece. <endOfText>
<human> Did you cry when you were looking at the photos? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love being able to be home for my kids <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful!  How many kids do you have?  That's a tough job but so rewarding! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my parents are moving back near me! They'll be here in about a month! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome!  How long were they away  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They moved away for a job about 8 years ago so its been a while.  They just love our hometown so they were working to come back if they could.  It makes me so happy! <endOfText>
<human> I am so happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is awesome!  How long were they away <endOfText>
<human> They moved away for a job about 8 years ago so its been a while.  They just love our hometown so they were working to come back if they could.  It makes me so happy!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I interviewed for a job promotion today.  I am pretty sure I nailed the interview. <endOfText>
<human> Great! What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a $50 bonus and it was very unexpected AND needed! <endOfText>
<human> That is a great surprise.   I bet you are very thankful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom makes me babysit my nephew all the time. <endOfText>
<human> I would not want to be in your position it's ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would not want to be in your position it's ok to help but all the time it can be dreadful. <endOfText>
<human> I am sick of it. He is a brat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting a new job next week, I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! congratulations too!  What do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am playing an official gig with a band I'm in and I can't wait. I know we'll be amazing. <endOfText>
<human> Wow congrats! What type of music do you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked into my living room to see my entire extended family holding presents. <endOfText>
<human> Oh what a scene. How did it make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend put vinegar on his ice cream sundae. <endOfText>
<human> oh my lord, please say thats not true. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty worked up right now, my wife went out to dinner with her friends and didn't bring me anything home! <endOfText>
<human> I would be mad! Did she say why she didn't bring you anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey there, Got to admit, I'm pretty lonely right now. <endOfText>
<human> Aw I'm sorry.  Why are you lonely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor woke me up this weekend mowing his lawn at 5am. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really frustrating! Who mows their lawn that early holy cow! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion at work, I cant believe Becky got it over me... I'm really upset about it. <endOfText>
<human> Gee, that is too bad. I wonder why Becky got it and you didn't? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been getting ready for this day for years, It was in the bag <endOfText>
<human> What day is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My white dog doesn't want to go outside lately but once he is out there, he is fine like he normally is! <endOfText>
<human> Do you have more than one dog?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to Florida in a couple weeks <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome! I've only ever been to Florida in order to get to Disney World. Are you there to visit family? Business? To sight-see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently heard that my father was laid off from his job. He's retirement age anyway, but I felt bad for him, as that must have been, at the very least, slightly humiliating. He's been a hard worker for 40 years, and has done well to support the family. But I do worry for him in the short-term. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awful!  I hope he is going to be okay.  Did they lay him off with severence or anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, he gets severance. He was a hotel manager, and I don't think the hotel was doing well, but I'm not sure that could or would be entirely attributed to his performance. Think they just wanted a change of scenery. I'm partially glad, since he needs to relax anyway. It will be good for his health <endOfText>
<human> Yeah.  He will get to spend more time with you all now!  Take the father on a vacation! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating a hot dog at school. I started laughing and almost choked in from of the entire school. <endOfText>
<human> I lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lad you was ok did anyone help you or was you embarrassed? <endOfText>
<human> No one helped me, they just all laughed. Luckily, I was ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my credit card and someone charged 500 dollars on it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy.  That's no good.  Did the credit card company alert you or did they miss it too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a little girl 3 weeks ago and she had to go into the NICU for breathing problems. I am so happy that we got to bring her home yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh goodness, is she okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The deadline for the work project was coming in two days and I was not done yet. Thankfully, my co-worker agreed to help me even though he was not obliged to <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of him. You should take him out for dinner. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my birthday next week. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. Do you have any party planned for this event? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm quite upset at those I know that complain all the time. <endOfText>
<human> You shouldn't let those kind of people upset you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend won a free trip to Hawaii. I wish it was me who had won. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! Yeah I understand that, maybe they will take you?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband broke his back in a car wreck a couple of years ago. For 2 week after we came home the church brought us dinner every night. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice. Is he doing better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is always there for me. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. My mother is like that too, and it's easy take for granted, but not all are so lucky ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever feel like you are the only person on the planet sometimes, like no one understands you? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, all the time! My girlfriend always thinks I'm so weird. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an exam next Monday that I plan to ace! <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear! What is the subject? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's in Pure Mathematics. I'm great with numbers and I've been studying a lot. <endOfText>
<human> That's something to be proud of! Good job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kept looking at the door expecting my father to walk in any minute. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you wasn't to disappointed was you to going to spend time together?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you wasn't to disappointed was you to going to spend time together? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, we was supposed to come see me, and he never showed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a pizza earlier and they overcharged me. <endOfText>
<human> Can you really put a price on pizza? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nowadays, yes.  I am irritated about it. <endOfText>
<human> I understand,  If a pizza is more than 10 dollars, im not paying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everytime i leave the house, who is behind me? my little brother. <endOfText>
<human> That must be so annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One night I couldn't sleep at all. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope you didn't have to go anywhere the next day? Did you try anything to help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tipped a vase over accidentally and it broke. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks. Did you hurt your foot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, but I had to sweep it up quickly before my mom found out. <endOfText>
<human> I read that wrong, I thought you said you tripped over a vase and it broke. Will you be in trouble if she finds out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got into an argument with my long distance girlfriend because she felt I wasn't listening to her closely enough while we were on the phone. She hung up, mad. Truth is, I was trying to do some work while talking to her, but I was listening as best I could, too. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Its always tough in relationships but when you can't go see her or make her talk to you afterwards, I'm sure its extra hard.  Did you call back and tell her that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't get into my car in the parking lot the other day and something was wrong with the lock, so I called a locksmith out to open the door and then realized, it wasn't my car. I wanted to crawl into a hole. <endOfText>
<human> Hahaha. I'm so sorry, but that made me laugh. I really don't mean to make you feel like I'm thinking you're dumb, because I don't. Everyone makes that mistake. I have an old Honda Civic, and I run into that problem, too. You probably gave the locksmith a good story to tell, and made his day. Hopefully you can smile at it tomorrow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ha ha.  I'm already laughing about it so no worries.  I felt like an idiot but also grabbed a picture of that car and my car and it even had the same beach sticker on the back of it. It was crazy!  Yeah, the locksmith was so nice that he didn't even charge me.  I was surprise but I guess he felt sorry for me.  he he. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, he didn't charge you? You both kind of won then! A good story for you both at no cost. Well, except for time. It was a good learning lesson. And yeah.. the bumper sticker.. that's crazy. I'm glad you're able to not take yourself so seriously. That makes for a great personality. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked in excited because i was finally going to the movie with my mother,  and she was layed out asleep <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well, I guess that was a bit disappointing huh. Well, maybe you can go real soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life doesn't always turn out how you expect it to be. <endOfText>
<human> I understand.  Tell me about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a promotion at work today. <endOfText>
<human> Woo hoo! What were you promoted too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In front of everyone my friend jumped off the lunch table and did a backflip. <endOfText>
<human> That's an interesting way to get attention. What spurred that on? Was it a dare, or was he just feeling wild? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is mad at me, and I feel like when we try to have another discussion tomorrow about why we're fighting, she's just going to get even more angry with me. We're not the best at communicating. <endOfText>
<human> Do you guys fight often?? How do they usually turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister had been feeling down after a breakup. <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry to hear that. What's worse is the best thing for breakups, the only thing that really helps, is time passing by. But the people who are hurting, in the moment, they can't really understand or accept that. So, you feel like you have to help and do something, when in reality it's probably best you don't smother them and that they have space. I hope she feels better, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had people stay at my house while I was gone over the weekend, so they wouldn't have to pay for a hotel. When I came back, they had left a mess and didn't really put in much effort to put things back where they found them. They were supposed to be good friends, too. <endOfText>
<human> That is disappointing. Did you confront them about it? I am sorry you have to deal with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved for work to a new area where I don't know anyone. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds stressful! How far did you move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just said his first words this weekend.  They just came out of nowhere. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that's wonderful and I know it really is so great to hear your child's first words! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in a relationship right now, but sometimes I see people who are single and wish I could go back to a time where I had more freedom, a more simple life. Plus, the feeling of possibility. The grass is always greener though, I guess. <endOfText>
<human> That is always true. The saying goes..water your own grass. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know that feeling when loneliness just hits you in the gut? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I do. I'm in a long distance relationship. I get that everytime I have to fly back home. I hope you start to feel better, though. Loneliness can end up being a good motivator, however. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sky diving instructor was strapped to my back,  and I had not a care in the world. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel their weight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends have been practicing for weeks. I think they'll do well at the volleyball match <endOfText>
<human> Are they usually a winning team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am away in another country for 2 months and I left my apartment with my friend. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that must be scary to have to trust someone else with all of your stuff. What took you out of the country? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very nervous about my wife giving birth next month. <endOfText>
<human> That is worrisome but also exciting. Is it your first child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset when my pet goldfish died recently. I really loved Goldie. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, how old was the goldfish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sad but ready for my child to graduate high school. <endOfText>
<human> Aw.  I bet that is so bittersweet. Do they graduate next May? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big certification exam coming up in 3 days and I feel like I'm ready to crush it. <endOfText>
<human> What is the certification exam for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week was so hectic. On Monday my daughter forgot her project and I had to bring it to her at school. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! Life is SO busy, never enough hours in the day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate that feeling when you get lonliness and it feels like it's going to make you vomit? <endOfText>
<human> Yes I do hate being all alone. That's how I feel when my boyfriend leaves town for work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a pretty good meal at the Olive Garden. <endOfText>
<human> Right on, that sounds cool. Did you go with family, or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? That's okay, too. I love Italian food, had always wanted to go to Olive Garden, but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up, we just never went. Now that I'm on my own, I've been... twice. Both times, they were just okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just found out I'm not getting a promotion at work that I was up for. I'm kind of bummed to not be moving up in the company that I work for, as I really like everyone here, and the company itself, and what we do. But I'm satisfied knowing that someone more deserving than me got it, and that they still see me as worthy in the long run, and that I still get to enjoy my current situation. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry the hear that.  Maybe another company would appreciate your talent. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow, I have my driving test. This whole weekend I practiced parallel parking which is the hardest part of it <endOfText>
<human> Just take your time and don't get so nervous you got this.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just take your time and don't get so nervous you got this. <endOfText>
<human> I am trying to. My friend who got his recently, has been helping me with some insightful tips for the test <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a C average but still graduated with a degree. <endOfText>
<human> That's ok.  Employers don't look at your grades I don't think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the upcoming football season. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it should be a good one. Who is your favorite team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking my dog last night and I saw a furry animal rummaging in the neighbor's trash can. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been somewhat weird. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to Vegas next weekend. I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds so exciting get ready for sleepless nights and long nights gambling. <endOfText>
<human> hahah I hope I don't too much time gambling. Don't want to come home broke. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to drive a truck. Never driven a car that big before. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, but I don't envy you... I've always just driven a little sedan. I'm an alright driver, but if I had to drive something bigger, I'd be nervous, too. Too easy for me to make mistakes. I kind of dread the day where I'll have to drive a big Uhaul truck. I hope things go well for you, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just got a promotion and a 10% raise. I should be ecstatic for what this means for our family and financial future, but it's hard to not let my selfishness and ego get in the way, and think about how she's been more successful than me. We're currently in the same industry. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you can observe what she's doing and use that to advance in the industry as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was riding my bike yesterday near some woods. I heard a creepy voice say "come closer I need to tell you something". <endOfText>
<human> That does sound creepy. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to the carnival this past weekend. It was a lot of fun <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is pretty cool. Were there any clowns there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to a local concert, and so many people were there. All the bands were unknown. <endOfText>
<human> Did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did it turn out to be a great event even though the bands was unknown? <endOfText>
<human> Yea, it was a whole lot of fun. Music was really good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been stressing at work, and my coworker gave me a pair of movie tickets they weren't using <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of them. What movie do you want to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend speaks 4 languages. I'm sure they'll get that interpreter job at the embassy <endOfText>
<human> That is very impressive. Do you know what languages they are? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The worst think is when I do not have any clean clothes for work. The other day I had to wear my yoga pants because I forgot to do the laundry. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. You can wear yoga pants to work? I'd like that dress code! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is the only girl on her speech team. She'll be gone with her team for 2 weeks <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, are you worried about her? Do you think she will be faithful? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a girl at the park today doing flips and a cartwheel. It was so crazy! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That is impressive! I can't even do a cartwheel on a mat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going camping next weekend. I heard there are making camping spots, so we won't have to sleep in our cars this time around. <endOfText>
<human> That <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man staring at my girlfriend in the restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> People really need to be more respectful. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got into a really bad car accident. I'm so glad she's ok <endOfText>
<human> That is scary. I hope she wasn't too shaken up from it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous about the certification test I have to take for my job. I am worried I won't pass it. <endOfText>
<human> It must be nerve wrecking especially since it has so much impack on your job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to China to a meeting for work. I've never been without my coworkers for these kinds of things. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting! When are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. I was so peeved. <endOfText>
<human> i hate that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad i couldnte eat my favorite dish <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. What's Your favorite dish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a nice shock the other day when my friends took me out to celebrate my birthday. I wasn't expecting for them to remember. <endOfText>
<human> thats amazing! where did they take you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe my eyes when my favorite aunt pulled up to get me from school. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. Did you get to do anything fun with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been exercising for months and I lost 10 pounds. I feel great! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Any plans to lose more? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I think so! I just bought some new clothes and I feel like a million bucks. <endOfText>
<human> that's great. were you losing for a special occasion or just to feel better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was devastated when my pet gerbil Gary passed away recently. I loved Gary so much! <endOfText>
<human> Oh.. i am so sorry to hear that my friend.. I understand your feelings. Have you thought about getting a new pet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker went into labor, and we somehow all brought a baby into the world <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though, huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special, unique bond for the rest of your lives, now.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome! And crazy... And scary... and awesome all at once! You must kinda feel accomplished though, huh? Good to hear that everyone is happy and healthy. Kind of weird how you all will have that special, unique bond for the rest of your lives, now. <endOfText>
<human> Yea. It was overwhelming but in a good way. And yea, guess we will all carry this special bond for the rest of their lives now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I booked an AirBnB for our vacation this week. We just got here, and they forgot to mention a little detail about having a cat. My spouse and I are both very allergic to cats... We can't stay here now! And yet we're getting charged for cancelling, and we have to find a new hotel. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I definitely would take it up wiht your credit card. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was chatting with this girl who I thought liked me, but she thought she was texting my friend. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Did you ask her to go out on a date? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped all over my head yesterday. Smelled kinda gross and I was quite disgusted. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Why did he do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My emu ran away last night. I was quite distraught. <endOfText>
<human> Not sure what an emu is. I hope you find him/her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My spilled soda on my laptop. After a day of not using my laptop, thank god it turned back on. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. That would have been an instance to cry over SPILLED milk indeed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son spoke his first word yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesom!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a sad kid at the store and bought him a candy to cheer him up <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's so sweet of you. Did it work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends didn't show up for bowling last night. <endOfText>
<human> damn dog , thats disappointing to here  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> damn dog , thats disappointing to here <endOfText>
<human> Well, wasn't really the dog's fault. It was my friends' fault that they didn't show up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to work the other day, and saw a mountain of pallets i had to open but i was confident i could finish <endOfText>
<human> Sounds impressive. Did you finish all of them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i finished everything , my managers were very impressed <endOfText>
<human> That's really good! Did they give you a raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just opened my whataburger bag when my wife reached for my fries <endOfText>
<human> Nice! How is your business doing nowadays? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 10 Big Macs the other day. Felt so bad thinking about all those starving children in Africa. <endOfText>
<human> oh my lord! only ten? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I arrived in San Diego yesterday. Felt so nice relaxing under a palm tree. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds wonderful! Are you going to visit the zoo? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I suffered from such terrible acne when I was younger that thankfully, I rarely ever have when I started college. <endOfText>
<human> That's really bad, but really good that your faced didn't turn out scarred for life.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really bad, but really good that your faced didn't turn out scarred for life. <endOfText>
<human> Well, I have some scars but at least I don't have acne anymore. <endOfText>

<human> That's really good for you. What kind of job do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> stocking an art department , and carry out furniture for customers <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a really neat job. Are you going to get a promotion soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend always interrupts me when I talk. <endOfText>
<human> lol.  Maybe you should talk to them about it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After working at my job for over 2 decades, they're closing down. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Do you have a new job lined up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog returned home after running away today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that must be such a relief. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to the bowling all by myself yesterday. It was quite lonely. <endOfText>

<human> Oh no!  I bet it smelled bad.  Did you clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had a great weekend out on the lake! <endOfText>
<human> That's really swell! What lake did you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once kept a notebook in which I wrote down how my friends would die. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. You were either very imaginative or upset. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my friend today <endOfText>
<human> That's kinda bad. What did you lie about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker returned 20 bucks to me the other day after I lost it. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good. Where did they find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a co-worker who frequently asks me to help him with his tasks. He is very incompetent and i can't understand how he was hired <endOfText>
<human> thats the same thing happening at my job , super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i used to collect spawn comics , one time i got home and saw all my comics torn up , it was so mad <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible. Did you find out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes my baby sister , she was like 3 years old <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I went to the post office earlier and it was closed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you go on time?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, did you go on time? <endOfText>

<human> I love flowers, that's great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am watching old episodes of game of thrones right now <endOfText>
<human> i have heard good things about that show.  are you a fan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Smelling the pollen in the summer air brings me back to when I got my first kiss. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very nostalgic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I studied a lot for the SAT because I needed to make sure I got at least a 2000. <endOfText>
<human> I never took the ACT <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my cousin just reconnected <endOfText>
<human> Interesting. What lead to that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well she moved away to college and didnt come back after graduating. <endOfText>
<human> Were you guys close when you were younger? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man it's so much fun to just have a good conversation with people. <endOfText>
<human> IT is. especially with family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset with my children <endOfText>
<human> That's no good. Why are you upset with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took out the trash today and the bag burst all over me. I knew I shouldn't have kept 50 pounds of ramen sitting in the fridge for 2 months. <endOfText>
<human> Why put ramen in the fridge? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 50 pounds of ramen the other day. Never felt so bad for all the college kids that gazed on in envy and horror. <endOfText>
<human> Can they not afford ramen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love cron dogs <endOfText>
<human> corn dogs are yummy. where do you get yours from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started to feel panicky and breathless. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good. Why did you feel like that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids wouldn't clean their room yesterday. I was quite displeased. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope you pardon them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, I hope you pardon them. <endOfText>
<human> I shan't! I will put them up for adoption on the morrow! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once saw the music sheet of the best clarinet player in my high-school band. <endOfText>

<human> Technology is not perfect <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time in high-school band, I didn't know whether or not I was supposed to wear my uniform to an important event. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh!  What happened?  Did you end up wearing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so scared! <endOfText>
<human> What is the matter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel sorry for the kid in my street. <endOfText>
<human> I feel sorry for him too, although I don't know what for. Can you refresh my memory? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Her mother beaten up severely. That's why she cried that much. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, yes, I remember now. That mother deserves to be hanged. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> None of my friends laughed at the joke I made yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is that a bad joke? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog took a fat ole dookey on my prized family heirloom. <endOfText>
<human> uh oh.  Did you put him in the corner? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I look at my old facebook photos a lot <endOfText>
<human> oh yea i bet that brings back a lot of memories <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I want my family to do well <endOfText>
<human> That is a very good wish to have buddy <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I hate when the cowboys lose at football! <endOfText>
<human> I know, they have so much talent too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone threw a pretzel at me at the baseball game. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I eat my dead skin cells <endOfText>
<human> What are you saying?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What are you saying? <endOfText>
<human> From my feet, I eat the dead skin. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My socks always smell bad. <endOfText>
<human> That makes sense, since your feet are likely gonna smell too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of the saddest moments of my life was when my rabbit died. <endOfText>
<human> I could not even imagine how you would have felt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The rain will go away tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope so.  It is making me a little blue. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We go school shopping to get ready for school! <endOfText>
<human> I have already done that and it is usually so depressing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never owned a car so seeing that my friend owns three of them is annoying sometimes, <endOfText>
<human> I understand that completly, i also do not have a car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My entire family came together and put me through college. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that's lucky! So they are paying for everything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and this guy that I met in class always had each others backs. <endOfText>
<human> That is truly magical. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole my dog from my house! <endOfText>

<human> I keep my money in the bank, never in a wallet! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate scary movies! <endOfText>
<human> Do you?  Me too!  Which one is your favorite? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going roller coaster riding for the first time this weekend <endOfText>
<human> I have never been, but i would be very unhappy about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's going to be scary but I think I can do it! <endOfText>
<human> I would be careful, it might break any time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car gets me where i need to go. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear! What kind of car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so dumb because when I liked this girl way back when, I asked her out over Facebook. <endOfText>
<human> I think in person would have been better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate driving in heavy traffic. <endOfText>
<human> I do not drive at all, i stay home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I eat tacos every single tuesday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes, I love taco Tuesday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew is playing 9th grade football this year. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I never get to go out and see people. <endOfText>
<human> Aw!  How come?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw!  How come? <endOfText>
<human> I guess i'm barely a human being. <endOfText>

<human> Oh that's exciting! Have you gone before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't think I'd get to go on this trip to Texas with my friends but I did end up getting to! <endOfText>
<human> Trips are very expensive to go on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feed and water my dogs every day. <endOfText>
<human> So sweet, It's good to have pets with us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll try new Chinese recipe today. <endOfText>
<human> I only like american food! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my girlfriend were so good for each other but she apparently didn't see that. <endOfText>
<human> i am sorry to hear that. i hope it wasnt a bad break. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew i would pass my test after all my studying <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. What subject was this in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A flood hit and destroyed my house oh god no. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. Was anyone hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset with the shipping company. They lost my special package! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did they reimburse you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting married this fall! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congrats on my behalf. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Motorist scratched my car in the road today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did you call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friends just got a girlfriend and it was really surprising that he would get one before the rest of us. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you surprised? Is he shy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He's pretty shy and also because he is just not great with women overall. <endOfText>
<human> Some girls like a certain type. Or maybe it was written in the stars. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad gave me this necklace way back in the day and it is so cool. I wear it every day. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet!  I bet he is an awesome dad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im riding some roller coasters this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool! Where are you gonna do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really tried hard to pass this class last semester but even studying didn't help. <endOfText>
<human> Aw I'm sorry. Can you retake the class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate eggplant for the first time ever <endOfText>
<human> How cool! What did you think of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can really rely on my parents. They were there for me whenever I needed them during college. <endOfText>
<human> That's a wonderful thing to hear!  Did you get through college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to go on my trip next week <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very sentimental  about the word fat <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean by that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and some buds got drunk and ordered pizza and it was great because they gave us way more food than we ordered. <endOfText>
<human> Wow really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for september! <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Why's that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sucks since I won't get to see my cat. <endOfText>
<human> Oops.  I didn't mean to type 5 LOL.  I hope you get to take breaks to go see your cat on the weekends :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> watching western movies reminds me of being a child. <endOfText>
<human> did you watch them with someone special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find it difficult to be around a crowd. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Does it make you anxious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I needed a D on a test to not fail the class, which was pretty bad anyway. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What grade did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I nervous about this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Why's that? Something important? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into an argument with my mom since we really need money and she wants me to get a job. <endOfText>
<human> Aww.  How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get feel so irate when I lose any form of game. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! I like to win, I guess that makes me competitive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait to go on my trip next week <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea? when is the trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not suprised that I will get a raise <endOfText>
<human> oh yea did you do a good job to get one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bad feeling when I was walking out of my calculus final. <endOfText>
<human> Why what happened? Hopefully nothing bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some days I feel so alone as if I'm the only person on this earth <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, that has happened to me before and it is an awful feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No one showed up for my birthday <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. What did your friends say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love giving my dog hugs and kisses, he needs my attention and affection. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah isn't that awesome!  What kind of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  cant wait to ace this test! <endOfText>

<human> wow, that is such a special occasion!what a gift <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> because you witnessed it. <endOfText>
<human> oh yes a gift, it was. Now she is about to turn 15 and start driving. I can't believe it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm prepared tell my girlfriend's parent how much I love my girl <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's exciting! Are you gonna propose or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friends was doing pretty bad in school but he really turned it around recently. I'm really happy about that too. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats good  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh thats good <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, he really started to try harder and getting really good grades! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when i got invited on a random trip <endOfText>
<human> Was a happy shocked feeling or a bad one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Romance movies bring me back to my youthful days <endOfText>
<human> oh really why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my teenage son borrow my car and he crashed it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, so sorry. Was your son okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until this weekend <endOfText>
<human> why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to get invited on a trip for next week <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awesome!  Where you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I booked a 5 star hotel for my vacation and there were roaches in the hotel room :( <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible. I would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds terrible. I would expect nothing less for a presumably high cost hotel. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I complained to the management and they gave me a new upgraded room. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted a new bike for my 10th birthday, yet all I got was a pair of socks <endOfText>
<human> You must have been rather disappointed. But its the thought that counts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my girl has been promoted i'm very excited <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool! What job does she work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting really weird, aggressive texts from someone and it was starting to really scare me. <endOfText>
<human> if it's someone you know you should ask them not to do it again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have faith that one day things will all work out <endOfText>
<human> I bet they will.  That's the way to look at things.  With some optimism! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my mother <endOfText>
<human> Ohh thats nice. May I ask what for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on a test last semester and feel bad about it <endOfText>
<human> I'm not one to judge. We all have done things we regret in the past. Why did you do it though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have hope for the human race even though its in its nature to destroy itself <endOfText>
<human> yea i know what you mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father bought me a new car, despite saying the day before that he would not buy it for me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's really nice of your father! What type of car did he get you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea I was so surprised! He got me a Mazda! <endOfText>
<human> That's nice that you can depend on your father. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very angry about my boss attitude to work <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like trouble. What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned a birthday party but no one came. <endOfText>
<human> so sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure i will pass my calc test coming up next month <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad that I don't have to deal with any of that for a few more weeks of summer vacation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For one of the first times, I was really excited to take a physics test because I knew I was gonna  ace it. <endOfText>
<human> wow i can relate, feels goof knowing you will do well so you can not worry about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am at my best when i have my favorite meal. <endOfText>
<human> nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stopped trusting people because of how I was treated last time I borrowed money out <endOfText>
<human> i bet .that is always a tough situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling nostalgic when I went to my brother's recent birthday party. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's always nice. What made you feel that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received an unexpected birthday gift from my favorite little nephew! <endOfText>
<human> awww how cool. what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat threw up on the floor today and i was mad <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's annoying when my cat does that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I had a car, especially seeing one of my friends that has three. <endOfText>
<human> yea i know what you mean, austin should share <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted to get an A in this computer science class but hey I got a B so that's fine. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome. B is great and you'll smash it next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get embarrassed very easily <endOfText>
<human> Give me an example of something that happened then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel guilty as a parent because I don't like to part in a lot of my children's school activities <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it just gets a little overwhelming. There can just be too much going on at once, especially if you have more than one child. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nominated for the best employee of the month award <endOfText>
<human> that is a very good achievement to hear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> trust is the key to everything <endOfText>
<human> That is true <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend passed his class last semester by trying really hard <endOfText>
<human> Which class was that? I'm glad to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All me and my friends did this summer was basically get high and eat a lot of fast food. It was a great time. <endOfText>
<human> yea i loved doing that all summer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really young and didn't know any better so I stole this item that I really wanted and felt bad afterward. <endOfText>
<human> You need to wipe away the guilt and seek forgiveness for yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking at how many friends my friend has and the fact that he has a girlfriend is kinda depressing and envious sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> i know what you mean i wish i had either <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my toe today and i was so annoyed <endOfText>
<human> That's so painful. I hope it didn't hurt for too long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I often feel jealous of my spouse. <endOfText>
<human> i know how you feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew nearly no one in college my first year and had no roommate <endOfText>
<human> Thats not nice for you. Did you try meeting people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a horror movie yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i know i am going to get the new job! <endOfText>
<human> It's excellent. My hearty congrats to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Playing with my children makes me so happy! <endOfText>
<human> I agree, nothing like seeing them smile and have fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I just prayed and thanked the Lord before eating my dinner. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, I don't pray often because I'm not too religious... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in senior year my brother moved out and my mom started to work a lot more. <endOfText>
<human> Did you start to feel a bit lonely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so shocked and hurt to hear my friend's puppy was stolen. <endOfText>
<human> Stolen? That's horrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am overcome by joy when I'm with my son's <endOfText>
<human> That's precious. How old are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My last relationship seemed to going so well until she basically flat out ghosted me. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry dude, thats rough. Do you know why she did that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad that I took home a large amount of change from the cashier at the store! <endOfText>
<human> oh yea i know what you mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go back to school and leave all my friends in 2 weeks time <endOfText>
<human> It's important to spend time with your friends while you can! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, so I let my cousin babysit my infant yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Great, I bet he did a good job  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Great, I bet he did a good job <endOfText>
<human> He did, I felt so trusting of him. I think I will call on him next time I need a babysitter! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get disgusted anytime I see people treat animals badly <endOfText>
<human> I agree, people who do animal cruelty should be in jail. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have just joined an advocacy group that is enlightening people about how they should treat animals so I am hoping thing will change <endOfText>
<human> Yes, we need to start teaching about this from a young age in schools. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a lot harder back in high school and it really made me happy when it paid off. <endOfText>
<human> wow, really, what was the result? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day i was in a haste to meet up with an appointment, i hit someone into the gutter, i made him miss his interview and i felt really guilty to meet up with my appointment <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's too bad, it wasn't your fault at least. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my wife a wrist watch for her birthday <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Did she like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend (ex) really made me upset when she broke up with me saying that she wasn't ready and then she found a new boyfriend almost immediately. <endOfText>
<human> Don't upset for her. May be she isn't worth for your love. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel twinge of envy on my sisiter! <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Why do you think that is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had no roommate freshman year of college and knew no one <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. That must have been lonely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was caught stealing candy from a local store. <endOfText>
<human> did you return it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was climbing the steers <endOfText>
<human> really? what happened afterwards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My walk become awkward <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didn't hurt yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Christmas is coming I can't wait for the joyous celebrations ahead <endOfText>
<human> Me too. Its always fun during Christmas  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too. Its always fun during Christmas <endOfText>
<human> It's the best time to gather around my family from far and wide <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents were able to pay for me to attend college, however I feel bad for those who were not lucky enough to be born into those circumstances <endOfText>
<human> Don't feel bad for the opportunity that you have. Life is not set out on an even keel so we all must make the best of our lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel disgusted when I see or smell any form of thing with bad odour. <endOfText>
<human> Same, I can never go into public bathrooms for this exact reason. It is amazing how bad it smells in one of those! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend (ex now) really bs'ed me since she said that she wasn't ready for a relationship but then she had another boyfriend right after she broke up with me. <endOfText>
<human> that is a slap in the face. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope i get this new job <endOfText>
<human> What job did you apply to then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised one day I scratched a lotto ticket to find out I had won £100. <endOfText>
<human> So exciting! What did you do with that money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh some guy in a truck cut me off twice on the interstate yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Really! That must have bee so frustrating for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea and I am so jealous that he drives around in it so recklessly! <endOfText>
<human> jealous? Not sure why your jealous of somebody being inconsiderate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really felt confident that I could trust and love this girl that I used to date. <endOfText>
<human> You always hope that is the case. Sounds like it didn't turn out well. I'm sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to my job interview tomorrow. I know I will get it. <endOfText>
<human> Well good luck and I'm sure you will. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm somebody that needs to always have everything organised and prepared. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I was more like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought a car that I have been waiting to buy for years now! <endOfText>
<human> oh really? that must sting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought i got a job but didnt <endOfText>
<human> You must have been disappointed. Did you ask why you didnt get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Uni is starting up soon and im nervous <endOfText>
<human> Why are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The banks are a good place to keep my money <endOfText>
<human> yea i agree with that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately for me, I really wanted to get an A in this class but instead I got a C. <endOfText>
<human> You must have been disappointed in that! Was it an important class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some guy I saw homeless 10 years ago, now makes 100k a year! <endOfText>
<human> That's so inspiring! How did he do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't sleep when I'm anticipating a big event or trip thats coming up <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, it's the excitement that keeps you up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's not fair that my sister gets to have my mother's favorite necklace! <endOfText>
<human> I know right. Did your Mum ask you to see if you wanted it also? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, so I sit by myself at lunch every day! <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because I have no friends. It makes me so lonely and unwanted. <endOfText>
<human> That is true? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave instructions <endOfText>
<human> To whom did you give instructions?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> To whom did you give instructions? <endOfText>
<human> My subordinate in the office <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son have got his engineering diploma last week. I am so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Excellent, you must feel proud of him as well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was at the mall yesterday and saw my ex having lunch. <endOfText>
<human> Did you talk to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep disconnecting from my internet <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when that happens. Where you doing anything important when it happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel proud of myself when I reach a new milestone <endOfText>
<human> thats great you should feel proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i studied so i knew the test would be a breeze. ive never studied so much in  my life <endOfText>
<human> Well done to you. Not everyone has that type of focus. What where you studying for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find it hard to be trusting of people. <endOfText>
<human> have you had a lot of bad experiences? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Small talk just annoys me <endOfText>
<human> I am not a fan either <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Theres no real meaning to it and most times they'd rather not even be there talking to you in the first place. <endOfText>
<human> I definitely agree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a little upset when my friend canceled on my last weekend, I was looking forward to hanging <endOfText>
<human> Sorry for that. I hate last minute cancellations. Did he have a good reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't feel that people are very trust worthy. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like my new manager. He is so kind and a good listener. I feel that I can trust him with any issue that I have. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great isn't it. I hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats great isn't it. I hate it when managers just boss you around and never listen. <endOfText>
<human> I hate that too. Most of the managers are like that. They never listen and they can be rude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my coworker in on a secret project and he helped me with it! <endOfText>
<human> I like secrets. Did it turn out the way that you hoped it would. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister bought tickets for my Mom and I to go to a concert. I wasn't expecting this but was quite pleased <endOfText>
<human> You must have been rather surprised. Did you thank her for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Of course I did. She really likes to give and expects nothing in return. Just takes great joy in seeing others happy. <endOfText>
<human> What a nice person. You should throw a party for her!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to get this job. I was prepared in the interview <endOfText>
<human> You must have worked hard for it! You deserve it then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was an important meeting today at work and on the way there my tire popped and by the time I got there, it was over <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. That is bad. What your manager did say about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, the men restroom was flooded because of a clogged toilet. It was so bad to see. I wanted throw up. <endOfText>
<human> wow what a horrible thing to walk into! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was flipping through an old childhood album and started feeling all sorts of emotions. <endOfText>
<human> Any good emotions <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ashamed when my mom got arrested <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, why was she arrested? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can I trust again when I have ben cheated on thrice <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you may be choosing the same kind of person each time. There are good ones. If you give up now you may lose the chance to find the person who is right for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After I moved out of state I lost contact with a very good friend. When they tried to reconnect I felt bad about not staying in touch. <endOfText>
<human> I understand how you feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait to go to the amusement park last week <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I saw a toddler taking dirt from the floor and putting it in his month. His mom was not paying attention. It is so bad to see. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when my brother got me a present last week. It was nice <endOfText>
<human> You must have thanked him for it! What was the present? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In my history class I read about the World Wars and felt so many emotions. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of emotions <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Like anger and sadness. I was very sentimental about it. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the time when thing were less expensive like houses. <endOfText>
<human> I miss those times too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got mad last year when I was fired <endOfText>
<human> I would had the same reaction. Why did they fire you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened my front door and there was an unexpected package... it was a birthday gift from my mom that I was not expecting! <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was a nice feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait to see a movie last weekend, I needed it <endOfText>
<human> Was it good> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an important exam tomorrow and feel that something bad will happen. <endOfText>
<human> What could go wrong when you're taking an exam? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its just that I feel anxious and think I am going to fail! <endOfText>
<human> I understand that but I think you will be fine! We all get that fear when it comes to an important test, it means we're human and still feel things! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a toothache and hate going to the dentist, this will put a damper on my day for sure! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh dentist visits are the worst. Atleast you can look forward to taking a break from work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a new laptop with my first salary. <endOfText>
<human> That's quite an investment. It must have made you feel good to be buying it with your own money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was offered a job and wasn't sure if I should take it or not. There were a lot of variables in play. <endOfText>
<human> Is it related to your passion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was impressed with a speaker at work last week. He really got to me <endOfText>
<human> Oh so what did he speak about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I went out to eat, and the food had a bug in it! <endOfText>
<human> That is gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty sad when my grandma died. It was so random <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, sorry to hear that. Hopefully, you have a lot of good memories of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle as in the hospital for a week, I will never forget that moment. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorrry, was he okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my brother got a promotion. He deserved it <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear! he must have worked hard for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor hit my dog backing out of her driveway because she sped out of it like some speed demon! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad. I failed my exams. I was so prepared. I don't understand what happened. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes that happens, maybe you lost focus during? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a reward for my project. <endOfText>
<human> Did that make you proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my girlfriend. I felt bad <endOfText>
<human> why did you lie to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new smart haircut and shave my shaggy beard yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Cool. You should look totally different? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the contruction site where I am working, we are extorted by a gang. We are so afraid. <endOfText>
<human> That does not sound good. You should speak to the police about this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when I saw my friend out and about. It had been awhile <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to catch up with them on what's been going on in both your lives? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have two kids and there aren't even words to describe how eager you get to meet your baby for the first time in the last few weeks of pregnancy! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds stressful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle was rushed to the hospital and has been there for many days now. <endOfText>
<human> Is everything alright? Do they know what's wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really believe the man I like will be asking me on a date soon. <endOfText>
<human> You must be really anticipating that move! What makes you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What I saw was not in my contract <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry that happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad for farting infront of a hot girl on the train. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. Did she notice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, a guy tried to robbed me. I was able to fight him and make run away. I am so proud about myself. <endOfText>
<human> Good job! Did you inform the police about this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some guy cut me off in traffic twice today. <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is transparent <endOfText>
<human> What is transparent, may I ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, so I made the bad decision of watching a horror film late at night alone. <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up having nightmares? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a large iguana at my door step and I almost passed out! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, that must have been terrifying. Is it gone now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend threw me a surprise party last week. It was random <endOfText>
<human> Wow, hope you had a blast and great time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so prepared for my driving test. I am pretty sure that I will pass. <endOfText>
<human> That's good news did you already take the written portion <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my mum made me a large, delicious meal and I ate it all! <endOfText>
<human> What was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad last week. My brother canceled on me <endOfText>
<human> That is rude of him. But I am sure he must have had a reason to do so. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thankful to have some time to relax today <endOfText>
<human> That is good. Do you feel grateful now that you feel relaxed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do. I might take a nap. <endOfText>
<human> You should. You will feel energized when you wake up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally came first in the race and felt so many emotions in my head.. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so awesome. I bet you worked hard.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds so awesome. I bet you worked hard. <endOfText>
<human> I did but at the same time I felt sad that I had devoted too much time to it and had ignored my family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when I got a letter from a friend in the mail <endOfText>
<human> That is a surprise where ou nervous to open it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Drinking coffee in the morning in peace is my happy place. <endOfText>
<human> Same here, I know how you feel buddy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can I not be when she is only 14 years old? <endOfText>
<human> How can you not be what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew it was going to be a good weekend. I had a feeling <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. What did you do during the weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, someone has stolen my bike. It was in front of my home with a lock. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds horrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my dad's wallet. <endOfText>
<human> really?  that must have been a desperate time for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an issue with my credit card and they put me on hold for 45 min before I even spoke to someone! <endOfText>
<human> Talk about annoying! Companies need to hire more people so we aren't sitting around on hold! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not able to go to Disney World and I was really looking forward to going. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am sorry to hear that... do you have plans on trying again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I found an old playlist with my old favorite high school music <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great time.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like a great time. <endOfText>
<human> yes brought back a lot of memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> am pretty sure they are going to expand our hours at work. <endOfText>
<human> are you happy about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied to get a new passport. They came back to me after two month to tell that they have lost my paperwork. <endOfText>
<human> So you have to do the whole process with the passport over again?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when I got fired last year. I did nothing wrong <endOfText>
<human> I feel sorry for you. Did you get another job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I taught to one of my neighbor's son for his exams. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cared last week for my girlfriend. She was sick <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Is she better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so jealous of Trump. I don't understand how someone not that smart can be so rich. <endOfText>
<human> He is smart to be that rich <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife gave birth to a fine baby <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome,a boy or girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im making about 200 or 400  a month on taking surbeys and 400 donating plasma, all of it is going to savings and putting it down on our house. <endOfText>
<human> 400 plasma? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to care for my friend last week. He was going through a breakup <endOfText>
<human> That is tough. That is so nice of you to be there for them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can’t wait until my nephew gets to come over. <endOfText>
<human> What are you guys going to do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For tax season this year I had planned ahead of time and was ready. <endOfText>
<human> It is always good to have things prepared in advance so you can get them done quick and easy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is getting older and having a tough time lately but I was a jerk that lost my cool and yelled at her on our phone call the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, it happens though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when a girl canceled our date. I was looking forward to it <endOfText>
<human> Did she give you a reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt good about my son's grade <endOfText>
<human> Did he all get A's? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting ready for a big presentation at work the other day. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious last weekend over a friend. They bought a new home <endOfText>
<human> Oh was it a nice house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having some issues with my manager. I have the feeling that I getting fired by the end of this week, <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's not good! What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished an interview for a new job!  I am fairly certain I nailed it! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I am sure you deserve it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am nervous about going on this date tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you nervous?  Just try to be confident <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry against my manager. I was expecting to go with him in work trip to New York but he went alone. I had him in high esteem before. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you were mad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my friend would pick me up from work. He was a trustworthy person <endOfText>
<human> Did he come to pick you up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt like this weekend was fine to me. I got to relax <endOfText>
<human> That's a good thing. A lot of people usually have to work on their weekends off instead of relaxing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a dead rabbit on the road. It was pretty sickening <endOfText>
<human> Oh my lord,  how long to you think it had been there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked into the bathroom to see my brother smiling and my fish bowl empty. <endOfText>
<human> Hahahaha funny though. Did he have something to do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so bad that I made him fear <endOfText>
<human> What happened? did someone scare you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker stole my presentation idea and claimed it was his, I can't believe it. <endOfText>
<human> WHAT? did, you have any idea beforehand,  or he just showed up with your idea. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I checked my grade and was astonished,  After everything I did, still a failing grade. <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad had cancer and was bed ridden <endOfText>
<human> Oh no,  How long did he live?  is he still alive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was late to work and my boss yelled at me. It made me mad <endOfText>
<human> Why were you late getting to work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was taking part in a play at school. I rehearsed her lines with her a great deal. I knew she was ready to nail this performance. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like she did well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious over my girlfriend. She is on vacation <endOfText>
<human> Why you didn't go with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to do well on my last test. I studied hard <endOfText>
<human> They say for the prepared there is no such things as a surprise test. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is my best friend, we talk about everything, and we are always there for eachother. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to have a brother like that. Most don't seem to get along. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry against Trump. He is started this tax war and now everything is increasing. <endOfText>
<human> Taxes are always tough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter slept all thru the night last night and I cant believe it. Amazing. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of her ha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know, especially after 18 months of being awake every couple of hours. <endOfText>
<human> That does sound stressful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous when it stormed over the weekend. It was raining hard <endOfText>
<human> I would have been too we get them bad here. Are you in the south?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would have been too we get them bad here. Are you in the south? <endOfText>
<human> I am in the southeast <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone ran into my car in a parking lot and didn't leave a note, it sucks. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a cowardly thing to do. Was there much damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure am glad that we live in a free country. <endOfText>
<human> Me too,  is there anything in particular you appreciate the most? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother gave me a present last week. It was nice of him <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Was it something you were needing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a week of long practice, I managed to win the golf tournament I was preparing for! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day some "stranger" approached me and started talking to me like they knew me. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> felt extremely stupid because i had no idea who they were. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well, its over now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely last weekend, My friends were busy and I was sick <endOfText>
<human> being sick sucks they shoulda came over atleast to bring you a goody bag  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> being sick sucks they shoulda came over atleast to bring you a goody bag <endOfText>
<human> That would have been nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was prepared for the storm last week. I had food and drinks <endOfText>
<human> LOL.....doesn't sound storm prep to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was deathly afraid of spiders. I moved into a house that had every kind of spider you can imagine <endOfText>
<human> I hate spiders too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so nervous and ready to start my move. It was such a long drive. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get it done <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Surprisingly yes, cant believe I did it. I left everything behind and only brought what I could fit inside my car. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a good start <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My car broke down yesterday and it had to he dropped off at the mechanic.  I an really nervous about how much it will cost to fix it! <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry. Why do you think it will cost higher? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, hope it will be less cost. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> We never are prepared for something like that.. how long ago was it? <endOfText>
<human> It was about 7 years ago, but it still stings <endOfText>

<human> I believe that, how did it happen? <endOfText>

<human> Oh man, I'm so sorry for your loss. I'm sure as time goes on it will become less and less. <endOfText>

<human> I can only imagine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard that the woods near my childhood home were torn down so they could build new homes. <endOfText>

<human> What did he lie about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He went out to another friends house, but didnt tell me where he was going.  Anything coulda happened and I wouldnt have known where he was. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> SheCONSTANTLY has things (big things!) just given to her for no reason! Last week, someone GAVE her a car even though she had a good one already! <endOfText>
<human> Really? Why did they give her a car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It seems every day in traffic i'll let someone out and don't get a wave or anything. <endOfText>
<human> Thats the worst when you do something for someone and they dont even appear to care!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats the worst when you do something for someone and they dont even appear to care! <endOfText>
<human> No doubt, but i always try to do what i would want someone to do for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came across an old letter from high school from one of my best friends. <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool, do you still keep in contact with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Barely, things usually change after highschool. Its too bad. It was nice to come across tho and have memories. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah for sure, i hardly speak with any of my highschool friends either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when my parents told me we would be moving, we went all the way to florida <endOfText>
<human> Oh sorry to hear that.. Don't you like florida? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made plans for my dream vacation. I had been looking forward to this trip for over two years. I broke my leg and was unable to make the trip <endOfText>
<human> So sorry to hear that buddy.. where were you planning to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends canceled on my birthday dinner. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> I completely understand your point, even i get emotional about my family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared about growing up, it is sort of unnerving <endOfText>
<human> That's true.. It is challenging. how old are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered takeout yesterday and I got home and found out half my food was missing. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The place shorted me. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good, did you complain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's hard not to be envious when I am struggling to get pregnant but all my friends are having babies. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, i hear you.. I can see how that can invoke envy.. you'll get there soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon <endOfText>

<human> Good for you.  Feels nice having school supplies squared away in advance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For sure! Everything ready to go, and I can relax and count down the days. <endOfText>
<human> You're excited for them to start back then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My next door neighbor is so inconsiderate!  He plays loud music at all hours of the night! <endOfText>
<human> Did you speak to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a repairman out to my house yesterday to fix my a/c. <endOfText>
<human> Let me guess, they are trying to overcharge you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going through a difficult time with my family and my friends are here for me, I'm thankful for them. <endOfText>
<human> Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son won an art contest at school it was so great! <endOfText>
<human> You must be excited and proud all at the same time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am both for sure! So happy for him. <endOfText>
<human> Is this something that he really enjoys? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently bought a truck. I thought I checked everything, but when I got home, I was really disappointed to find there was no cruise control <endOfText>
<human> Is it something that you can go back and have added on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just had some test done and now we have to wait for the results. <endOfText>
<human> Uhoh that sounds terrible.  Have they told you how long you might have to wait for?  That's no fun having to wait to hear news like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a great interview for my dream job and I am waiting to hear back! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to throw my daughter a party this year for her birthday in our new home! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting! What sort of plans do you have for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to decorate the entire house in a winter wonderland theme since shes a winter baby, and then take her to the beach for a day or two. We live in the south. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really exciting and like it will be a hit! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoy driving my old truck. <endOfText>
<human> What kind is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got cable <endOfText>
<human> Well, now you'll have some good television to watch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A fly landed in my coffee when the moment I walked out of my house. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I would have been so annoyed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nope, I keep my schedule pretty tight. <endOfText>
<human> So annoying!  I need my coffee in the morning to function. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my younger sister got pregnant, all I could think about was her as little baby.  It was a trip. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get a little baby crazy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww, congrats!  I absolutely love having a niece. <endOfText>
<human> I'm excited. She's been trying for a couple of years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend found out I shared a secret he told me.  I really feel embarrassed! <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  I hope it wasn't a super important secret at least. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I get emotional about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> nothing wrong with that it sounds sweet and caring of you! How many do you have?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> nothing wrong with that it sounds sweet and caring of you! How many do you have? <endOfText>
<human> 2, and they are both younger than me, so I was there role model growing up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ive been working very hard at work to get a promotion and I finally got it! <endOfText>

<human> Awesome, that is great, congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been faithful and loyal to my girlfriend of almost 3 years <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Are you going to propose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel sort of bad. <endOfText>
<human> For what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping the new super smash bros game will be really good when it comes out <endOfText>
<human> I am too, but you know how Nintendo let's down it's customers sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to pay guys to sit around all day, trying to help another company backfired. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry! Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I go to the store almost every day <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like it can be exhausting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents always praised my brother more than me for every little thing. <endOfText>
<human> Is there any good reason for that ie <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Possibly but either way it always felt unfair. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  I understand why you feel that way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is there any good reason for that ie; he has really low self esteem? <endOfText>
<human> Possibly but either way it always felt unfair.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my sister was finally able to get pregnant last week. <endOfText>
<human> omg so amazing! beautiful! Im happy for you both. :) How far along is she?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> omg so amazing! beautiful! Im happy for you both. :) How far along is she? <endOfText>
<human> Not sure exactly, Its supposed to be a 'secret' but my mom spilled the beans on accident.  Apparently she was going to surprise my dad with "i'm an uncle" and "i'm a grandfather" shirts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ughhh its so hard to keep good secrets tho honestly! <endOfText>
<human> ha, My mom is especially bad at keeping screts of that type.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tv has gotten so good in the past few years <endOfText>
<human> I agree with you! What are you into watching right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why are women's public restrooms always so nasty? I was in one at the pool yesterday and pee was everywhere! <endOfText>
<human> You are so right. I dont get it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always have the highest hopes for my boyfriend and his work. The other day he found out he won <endOfText>
<human> What did he win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors kept me up all night <endOfText>
<human> Where they too loud? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> usually people who work weekends. It's pretty rude they were so inconsiderate. <endOfText>
<human> They just moved in too. I hope it was just a housewarming and not a regular occurence <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll keep my fingers crossed for you! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the county fair last night with my family. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter is such a jerk <endOfText>
<human> They can be difficult.  What is the issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to love playing pokemon with my friends what a great game that was as a kid <endOfText>
<human> Yes it was! I loved collecting the cards. They have pokemon go now  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it was! I loved collecting the cards. They have pokemon go now <endOfText>
<human> I have played that, I love it, I cannot wait for the new pokemon game for the switch <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter begged me to let her go in the pool with her swimmies. ( inflatable safety gear ) <endOfText>
<human> Did you let her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes but I was scared but I trusted her! <endOfText>
<human> I get that, swimming can be dangerous for kids <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get emotional about my brothers sometimes, they are so important to me <endOfText>
<human> Are they older or younger? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel awful for being nasty to the cashier in the checkout line today. It was uncalled for. <endOfText>
<human> What did you say to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so happy i can afford a better car, my old car i had to fix every 5 months <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome!!! you will save a lot of money for sure.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats awesome!!! you will save a lot of money for sure. <endOfText>
<human> yes the car was worth 3500 and i use to spend around another 2000 a year just fixin git <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My house is in closing right now, should be a few more weeks but it feels like forever. I cant wait. <endOfText>
<human> i know how that feels <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought some off brand water the other day because it was on sale. <endOfText>
<human> Well, water's water, so it should work out ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my county fair last night and listened to some music. <endOfText>
<human> I haven't been to a fair in so long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather is beautiful and I am headed out to the motorcycle rally today! <endOfText>
<human> do you own a harley ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbor keeps borrowing my shopvac and she never returns it on time <endOfText>
<human> You may want to think about not letting her borrow it anymore.  Sounds pretty rude to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I called my friend for advice last night <endOfText>
<human> What did you call for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have this feeling that I shouldn't drive my car again until I can get new brakes put on. <endOfText>
<human> What's wrong with your brakes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I interviewed for a new job but, didnt get an offer. <endOfText>
<human> Are you sure you didn't get an offer but they are running behind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my bff. We started out a servers together in a restaurant <endOfText>
<human> do you guys still work there ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dogs come first, i make sure i take care of them before anything else <endOfText>
<human> Well that's sweet. I bet they love you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had a stressful time lately. I'm trying to get to a more peaceful place, but it sure is hard. <endOfText>
<human> You should take a vacation! That always helps me clear my mind. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People used to be way more sociable. <endOfText>
<human> They did.  I've struggled with trying to be more social, I think it makes life more fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really shocked when my parents bought me a car for my graduation present <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Thats awesome. What type of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its sad that some people can't afford the necessities in life. <endOfText>
<human> i could agree with this <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am killing it a work <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. What do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered $50 worth of food to be delivered the other day. <endOfText>
<human> For a party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dr Pepper is my coffee. Its the first thing I do when I get up <endOfText>
<human> I love DR. Pepper. It's just so hard for me to keep the weight down if I continue to drink it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I poured too much vodka in my drink last night <endOfText>
<human> How is that feeling today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hurt when my grandmother passed away a few years ago <endOfText>
<human> time heals all pain <endOfText>

<human> Oh! That's great to hear. What were you fighting about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got asked to go on a cruise but, I'm not sure if I should. <endOfText>
<human> Cruises are fun. What is the problem? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I at someMcDonalds in my car the other day <endOfText>
<human> How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> o I have this neighbor who lives down the street who walks her dog without a leash. It is so annoying and its some kind of pit mix dog and it scares me that she has him off leash. I also found poop in my yard and I'm prestty sure it was from that dog! ugh! <endOfText>
<human> well, that's not nice at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked up on a snake in my yard a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> No!!! I would die!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep my kids picture on all of my screensavers <endOfText>
<human> That's nice :)  I do that with pictures of my wife. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  remember having dinner at my ex's parents for the first time <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were very nervous that day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> people need to move over to the right lane, i hate when they go slow in the left <endOfText>
<human> That is so true!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so glad i could afford a new sofa, i hated my old one <endOfText>
<human> What kind of sofa is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a nice genuine leather set <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! Congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like watching romantic movies but my wife really wanted to watch "life as we know it" last night and i actually liked it <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I dont think anyone should feel ashamed of what they look like in a bathing suit. We all have imperfections! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Helping others out around the community is not uncommon around here, There are lots of clothes and food drives too. <endOfText>
<human> that's great to hear! I love when people help each other <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. We also run into people who take advantage too, and that can be disheartening. <endOfText>
<human> oh i know. I always try to help as much as i can. i donate clothes and food <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a mouse in my kitchen once . <endOfText>
<human> That has happened to me too. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I first started working out I dropped a weight on my foot! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That had to be painful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter failed an exam last year <endOfText>
<human> Did she not study enough? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy my girlfriend wanted to move in together. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Have you found a place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am beyond mad.  My neighbor was mowing his lawn and my car got scratched from rocks kicked out by the mower! <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks! Did you complain to him?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That really stinks! Did you complain to him? <endOfText>
<human> Yes!  He said it was my problem and not his! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fail at every diet I try. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  Do you always try specific diets or do you sometimes just try to eat less? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled some generic baby soap all over the carpet the other day and had to leave it for about an hour while I tended to a more urgent matter. I came back and it had bleached the carpet! <endOfText>
<human> OH that's terrible. Even worse that's in baby soap? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another one of my friends got engaged <endOfText>
<human> Thats great for them!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats great for them! <endOfText>
<human> But what about me? I am the only single one now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night i woke up in the middle of the night and i couldn't move! I was completely awake but i couldn't make a sound or move!! It was so scary!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That might be one of my worst fears!  Could you sleep any more after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did. I fell back asleep, i don't even remember how, all i remember is waking up in the morning. Apparently it's called sleep paralysis <endOfText>
<human> I've heard of it, but I can't even imagine going through it.  I'm sorry it happened to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend is moving out of state <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  I hate when friends move away.  Are you really good friends with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to work late yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks :( Why did you have to work late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying to overcome some depressive episodes that I've been having. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you're having trouble :(  Is there anyone you can talk to about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad it finally cooled down outside! I hate heat and humidity, makes me feel so miserable <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. It's been super hot and humid here for weeks. The only time i get out of the house is to go to the pool or get groceries lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There si always a fight when my family gets together <endOfText>
<human> Is it more of verbal arguing or flat out physical fights? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow. What do they usually argue about? <endOfText>
<human> The stupidest thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece made the cheerleading squad. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Thats awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pleased with how I've been handling a large amount of stress lately. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, stress is so common in life so it's easy to become overwhelmed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a close family member who fell ill after being laid off from her job. I didn't like seeing her struggle to pay medical bills so I had to help. <endOfText>
<human> That's very nice of you. We need more compassion in the world for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I drove all the way to work, just to be told they changed the schedule and I wasn't supposed to be there. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, were you happy about not having to work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I stole a candy bar from a store, I felt so ashamed <endOfText>
<human> it happens to everyone , i stole too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> robin williams was my hero, so sad he passed <endOfText>
<human> I was devastated as well, he brought joy to all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I practiced hours and hours to get ready for a big meeting <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how did that go? It sounds important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend told me about a local barbecue restaurant so I decided to stop by a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> What sort of meat did they have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love my house, not the biggest on the block but i ts enough <endOfText>
<human> What is the square footage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been appreciative of my parents paying for college <endOfText>
<human> consider yourself lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been quite upset with my daughter's school as they've really let her down. To make a long story short. Since she's now the only surviving 8th grade strings student (violin), they've lumped her in with the regular band this year rather than let her play with the 7th grade strings class. <endOfText>
<human> I would be upset too! Why would they do that? did you try talking to teachers or principal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my coffee maker today and i'm so mad because i can't make coffee. I can't survive the morning without coffee <endOfText>
<human> Anyplace near you where you can get a cup? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked into a job interview unprepared, I was actually given the job days later which was a blessing <endOfText>
<human> Nice.  I've never had luck with being unprepared for things, I always choke. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I caught my boyfriend messaging another girl. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful! Did you break up with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a bachelor party coming up and i'm so nervous <endOfText>
<human> Aw man they are usually a lot of fun. Why are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I arrived at work and my office had a cake and balloons for my birthday. I want expecting anything because my birthday wasnt until Sunday. <endOfText>
<human> aww, that's so sweet of your co workers! You're definitely appreciated there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i'm trying to participate in a bodybuilding contest. I was working really hard to get fit and i really think i can win <endOfText>
<human> How many hours a day are you training <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to make a sandwich one day and the entire laof of bread was covered in mold! <endOfText>
<human> ewww! that's gross. I actually made a toast for my son yesterday and when i was about to give it to him i noticed a little bit of mold on the side. i almost threw up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am patiently waiting to hear back from a recent job interview <endOfText>
<human> How do you think the interview went? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> harvey weinstein made such great movies until he ruined it <endOfText>
<human> What were some of your favorites? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could afford all the material items people have around me <endOfText>
<human> like what kind <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to next year. My finances will be straightened out by then. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Have you been doing ok this year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A co-worker got a promotion over me <endOfText>
<human> Aw man. Who has been working there longer, you or the co-worker? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you receive any sort of feedback as to why you might have been passed over? <endOfText>
<human> It was kinda bullshit. Everyone things the guy is kinda dumb but, goign to lunch with your hiring manager 3 times a week has its perks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last weekend me and my girlfriend got into a fight. Luckily I have great friends to talk to and be there for me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's unfortunate...did you guys reconcile? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it is always better to get what you deserve .. how do you  feel about this <endOfText>
<human> I think so.  Generally getting more or less than what you deserve to get is unbalanced. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> of course.. i felt it discouraging in some way.. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that.  Hopefully everything works out in the end though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling really bad about how far I've gotten behind on my bills. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry! Are you going to be ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat pee sometimes on my bed and i hate it because the smell is so hard to remove <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that's terrible. is you cat fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i feel very horrible because i lied to my wife the other day <endOfText>
<human> oh no, that's bad :( what did you lie about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview scheduled for Friday. I really want the job. It is making me so nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Been there myself, the anticipation can really get to you.  What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I am feeling bad today. <endOfText>
<human> COuld you explain why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep a picture of my late great grandmother in my wallet at all times <endOfText>
<human> Do you miss your grandmother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was checking mail everyday to see if I had won the contest <endOfText>
<human> Any luck yet on that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids broke a family heirloom of mine recently and it made me so angry. <endOfText>
<human> OH NO! Is it fixable or totally destroyed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew for a fact I posted the highest score in the bowling match <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Have you been bowling for a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working a lot this year. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe is time for vacations? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very positive about the democrats in November <endOfText>
<human> I'm a very apolitical person.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a very apolitical person. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, less stress in your life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally sent a text about my friend to that friend instead of my cousin who I meant to send it to! It wasn't mean but it wasn't necessarily nice either. I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> That's embarassing.  What was their reaction? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No reply... I think shes just going to pretend it never happened, which is good with me! <endOfText>
<human> Pretend with her.  Maybe it's best to act like it didn't happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi I am so mad at my friend. <endOfText>
<human> What did they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a bit taken back when I had to move out of my parents house <endOfText>
<human> What happened to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited about today my friend <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a good time with my family at the county fair last night. <endOfText>
<human> I havent been a county fair in ages. Did you make yourself sick eating junk food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brothers baseball skills always wowed me <endOfText>
<human> How long has he been playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my best friend passed away I was devasted <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry to hear that. How long ago was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been considerate of my relationship with my wife, I would never cheat <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. How long have you been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone keyed my truck in a restaraunt parking lot last night <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you ask  the restaurant if they have video? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my group of friends went to the beach last weekend and did not invite me for some reason. I don't really know why though? <endOfText>
<human> That was rude. Did you confront them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son started walking when he was nine months old <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's pretty early! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when me and my brother used to play video games together. nintendo and stuff.. it was so much fun. i miss those times <endOfText>
<human> awww, i used to play sega with my brother :) it was awesome. streets of rage was my favorite game <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always think about my childhood and the good times I had with friends <endOfText>
<human> Same.  There's a lot of things I wish I could go back to for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I have to work too hard for what I'm paid. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Maybe you should ask your boss for a raise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to take gymnastics lessons, where the instructor would spot or make sure that we didn't fall when we tried to do new tricks. Thank god they were there because I wouldnt be alive from hitting my head when falling! <endOfText>
<human> Uau, that was a close call indeed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared of Trump. He is on his way to create a civil war in the USA. <endOfText>
<human> That is interesting, why do you say that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm annoyed that I don't earn more. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I know how that goes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm kind of sad my little boy is growing up so fast and starting Kindergarten next week. <endOfText>
<human> They do grow up quickly don't they! But just think of all the wonderful new things he'll learn and friends he'll make. He'll be able to tell you all about it when he gets home! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got new neighbors who let their dog bark at all hours of the night. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really annoying. Have you said anything to them about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend came over and cleaned my entire house while I was sick with the flu. <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice. Did you feel better after that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working so hard on my job! <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Traffic was unusually bad on the way to work this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I hate getting stuck in traffic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i went to the gym the other day and i was using a traidmill and somebody told me "get off the traidmill fat ***" <endOfText>
<human> what???? That's terrible!! what a horrible person! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working out for 2 months now and I finally started losing some weight so I'm hopeful I'll see lots of results soon. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Congratulations. How much weight have you lost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to be trusting with my family. It makes life easier that way. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. If you can't trust family, then who can you trust? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job tomorrrow. I'm a little nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry too much! I'm sure you'll do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend kept me up all night playing video games <endOfText>
<human> Ugh that is so annoying. I try not to do that when I with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a big final exam that I studied really hard for. I passed with an A <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. Sounds like you studied hard! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a sick dog in my house. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. That must make you sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to my finances getting better next year. <endOfText>
<human> Will they be improving by alot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sitting on my couch the other day, when my two year old came out of nowhere, and threw my phone at my head. It hurt really bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh jeez, did you ask him why he did that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One night I came home and caught my wife sleeping with my best friend <endOfText>
<human> Whoa!  I'm sorry to hear that.  Did you want to kill the guy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a $20 gift card from the place I work at today. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was a nice surprise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will be getting paid today! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! That's an odd day to be paid, but good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat won't leave me alone <endOfText>
<human> Did you feed it lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My childhood cat died the year after I left home for college. <endOfText>
<human> Losing a pet is a hard thing.  Was the cat old or sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at dinner the other night and spilled my drink all over myself. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good! Did it stain your clothes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss passed me over for promotion and instead went with my coworker <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, did you mess up on some job activities? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling very hungry earlier today. <endOfText>
<human> Did you eat something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to be reunited with my family, the anxiety of this is killing me <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are super excited for it. When are you going to be together/  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you are super excited for it. When are you going to be together/ <endOfText>
<human> Yes I am :) I will be meeting them next weekend, I have been in prison for 2 years now I am getting released next saturday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother broke his leg a few months ago, and I took care of him to make sure he was okay. <endOfText>
<human> I pray he gets well soon. I had a similar experience so I know how it feels <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He is almost healed up, but it was nice to take care of him to spend more time together. We usually dont get along. <endOfText>
<human> Great, congratulations <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two daughters are both musicians. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats.You must be very proud of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am more than ready for my vacation to Europe. <endOfText>
<human> When will you be going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a scare while in my yard a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy for my son when he won the state championship for tennis <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Congratulations and well done. He must practice long and hard to get to that stage in the game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a family get together full of contests, and my sister won but I wish I would have won. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, well you can't win everything. Be happy for her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy for her, but I really wish I would have won. <endOfText>
<human> Was there a prize you wanted from it? Or just recognition? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my friends got to go on vacation, but I'm stuck here doing work because I have a tight job deadline <endOfText>
<human> Thats a bummer! I hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats a bummer! I hope you guys can plan something together once the deadline is over! <endOfText>
<human> Maybe, but I'm not sure when another opportunity like this will come. It really gets me down <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked to school one day. <endOfText>
<human> Did your car break down?  I always hate when unexpected things come up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent all day yesterday waiting for my cable guy to show up as expected.  It never happened. <endOfText>
<human> They always give a 4 hour window and either show up late or not at all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when I didnt earn the promotion. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, maybe you'll get the next one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a huge craving for ice cream the other day but I never got any. <endOfText>
<human> What is your favorite ice cream? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like chocolate but I didn't make it to the store in time and they were already closed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is unfortunate, maybe next time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I got to my job, I was fired without cause. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  Did you at least get a severance? Were you able to get another job since? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching my son for the second day in a row, and I realized I needed more interaction with adults. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe find another adult with a kid for a play date <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always been loyal to my wife and children above all else. <endOfText>
<human> I understand I think that's a good thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got first place in the karaoke contest last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> oh how cool! I bet you have a very beautiful voice. was there any prize? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother recently told me that once, when we were kids, he spit in my orange juice and let me drink it. <endOfText>
<human> lol that's terrible. Did he do stuff like that a lot back then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the county fair last night. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds fun.  What did you do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that my storage unit burned down over the weekend.  I lost several items. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Did the storage had insurance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but the things that were lost were keepsakes and momentos.  Very difficult to replace those items. <endOfText>
<human> I understand.The emotional value is inrepleacable <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so relieved that president Trump won the election. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you are please.  I am guessing you are a fan of Trump. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm glad it's almost fall now. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I agree. The heat here in Texas is killing me. It was 112 last week! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my bestfriends was involved in a car accident that ended up being extremely bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was anyone badly injured? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah all of them were injured extremely, and his gf was actually killed in the passenger seat. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. I hope your friend recovers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin won $5000" <endOfText>
<human> What?!? That is awesome. I would be so pumped up. Were you happy for him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother passed away recently and it was a really hard time. When I returned to work my coworkers got me flowers and made me feel welcome. <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of them. Sorry to hear about your mother.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That was really nice of them. Sorry to hear about your mother. <endOfText>
<human> Its getting better now. Im just glad to know that some people have my back. It was very nice of them and Ill forever be thankful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old baby blanket when i was cleaning out my closet. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I bet that was a blast from the past. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a super flashback!!! I loved it. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like it! It makes me want to go find some of my old stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad about myself <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently applied for a new position at a higher paying company and they called me for an interview! <endOfText>
<human> God for you.I am sure you are ready to ace that interview. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting ready for an upcoming economy crisis in the USA <endOfText>
<human> Do you think that we are going to have another 2008 all over again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well my wife just quit her job, but if this new endeavor works out, we'll be better off in the long run. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of endeavor are you reffering to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel like myself from the past when I drive my old truck. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a good time.  What kind of truck is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I found a ten dollar bill on the ground. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, you bust be lucky! I only see coins haha! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi friend, I recently went on a fishing trip. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like fun. What kind of fishing did you do? Fly fishing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor lets her cats use the bathroom outside, in my yard. Its gross. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty nasty. Have you confronted her about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have but she doesnt seem to mind at all. It just smells gross. <endOfText>
<human> That's really inconsiderate of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week my wife and I almost walked into a store where a shooting had taken place. <endOfText>
<human> what?? that is so scary! I'm glad you are safe. that's why i always have my gun with me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when we were struggling financially we told our pastor and our church gave us some food and money. i don't know what we would do without them and their help <endOfText>
<human> That's great they were able to help you out. Are you doing better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in a town that has several major highways. The other day I passed an awful accident where a car was mutilated beyond recognition and it was do to the carelessness of someone speeding onto the on ramp of the highway and not watching the traffic coming as they entered it. It made me angry. <endOfText>
<human> It is truly horrible. Such incidents mostly happen due to drivers being careless like texting while driving. I hope no deadly casualties had been involved in this event <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bragged too much about being good at FIFA. We played a round against each other and I beat him very badly at it <endOfText>
<human> Good for you!!! I think its annoying when people act like that about anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to hold out and see if I got a bonus. <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up getting one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had an uneasy feeling lately and I really don't know why. <endOfText>
<human> Are you stressed out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was praying to god to help out our family <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, what is the matter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hoping to get my car in the body shop this week but I still have not heard from my insurance company. <endOfText>
<human> Try and give them another call to see what the situation is <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told a secret to my friend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! What type? A fun secret or one of those sadder ones?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh! What type? A fun secret or one of those sadder ones? <endOfText>
<human> A fun secret, but I needed to be sure he could keep it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I researched for weeks for my paper. <endOfText>
<human> Reasearching papers can be tiresome.  Did it turn out well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that I had to cancel my vacation.  I am pretty bummed. <endOfText>
<human> that is awful, hopefully you can plan another one soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so.  My friend had to back out at the last minute, so my plans had to change. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry, thats the worst <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very disappointed in myself. I failed my driving test today for the second time. Can't get a car as i need a license <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I am so sorry. How long do you have to wait to take it again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my new phone yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, that's bad. Did you have insurance for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am just waiting for my next vacations <endOfText>
<human> I love vacation time.  Where are you planning on going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started seeing this girl and I saw a red flag. Not sure if I should distance myself or keep seeing her. <endOfText>
<human> maybe just take it slow <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big test coming up. <endOfText>
<human> What subject is it in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy to have an old friend that understands me. <endOfText>
<human> That is great for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I have been married for 7 years and I've been faithful the whole tie. <endOfText>
<human> That great news.  I don't know how rare it is but in the 14 years I've been married we've seen a lot of other couples suffer with infidelity. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very satisfied with the way things are at work <endOfText>
<human> I love to hear that, positive stuff! Im glad for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to hear that, positive stuff! Im glad for you. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks buddy, being content is just a way of showing gratitude to the universe about all the good stuff I have being blessed with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lightening hit my house and fried all of my appliances! ugh frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been self conscious for a few years about myself. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. I think everyone feels that way to a certain degree, even if it is more for some and less for others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week a couple days after getting groceries I was looking for my childs other shoe in the car. It was then that I discovered a carton of eggs that my fiance forgot to get out of the car with the rest of the groceries!!! I was soo grossed out. <endOfText>
<human> Yuck, that would be bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a little baby cat today near my house. <endOfText>
<human> Are you planning to keep it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a little uneasy about making it through the last half of the year. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some person cut me off in traffic yesterday and almost caused me to wreck. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Gosh I hate it when I have to work on complicated parts in my boat engine, when my friend is helping me. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried seeking expert help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nah I can do it myself, I just have to hope that my buddy doesn't do anything crazy when my hands are in between the hydraulic lines. <endOfText>
<human> hahahahah so you are more worried about your friend than actually fixing the boat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lightening hit my house and fried all of my appliances! ugh frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, that's crazy! Do you have home insurance to cover the cost to replace everything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I had a car crash today.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh! Are you alright?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh gosh! Are you alright? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but my car is messed up now. :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to do scuba lessons in a couple weeks.  For some reason I am really nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> dont be nervous, your instructors will not put you in danger <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was watching a talk show and they started talking about how if you eat a big meal like dinner after 4 hours prior to going to bed, that it results in more rapid weight gain and hinders weight loss! I had never heard that before! <endOfText>
<human> I didn't know the exact timing like that, but it's believable and I know it's harder for the body to use the energy when you eat late. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, my friend is coming to visit me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? When is your friend arriving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a test at work the other day.  I wasn't really fretting it though. <endOfText>
<human> Did you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rode a roller coaster at the fair for the first time the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Well cool!  Were you nervous at all going into it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is messaging me and it's annoying. <endOfText>
<human> Why is it so annoying? Is your friend messaging you all the time or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on a vacation soon! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where will you be going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my temper with my father and said some rude things I shouldnt have said when I was younger. <endOfText>
<human> Don't beat yourself up about it. I did the same with my mother all the time when I was in my early teens. We've all been there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I try not to but once you get older you realize it wasnt the nicest or brightest thing! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I agree, I still feel awful about it myself! But I think our parents understand and don't take it to heart, because they usually did the same thing too :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is such a gorgeous day outside today.  The problem is that I have no one to share it with. <endOfText>
<human> It is a gorgeous day where I live too! I'm sorry you don't have anyone to share it with!  Do you have plans later? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You'll never guess what happened! I am so embarassed. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter walked for the first time! <endOfText>
<human> that is incredible i bet you are really proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very much so! Its amazing. <endOfText>
<human> i remember when my daughter did her first steps i was so proud of her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, you will never guess what happened to me at work. <endOfText>
<human> Probably not.  But now I'm interested to know.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently looking through an old photo album and it made me feel strange. <endOfText>
<human> What made you feel strange? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset about my current working situation! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am sorry to hear that, what is going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so at ease right now with life, finally after all the hecticness. <endOfText>
<human> That's good you're getting a break! Life is much more rough as an adult than I thought it would be as a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> for sure they really dont prepare you enough for it. <endOfText>
<human> No kidding! I'm glad things are good for you now - rest, relax, and enjoy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This is the best week of work for me. I will be getting a raise! <endOfText>
<human> Money is always amazing! Good for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Money is always amazing! Good for you. <endOfText>
<human> Yep, mama always said: work hard for that chocolate! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Go for the dark chocolate its more expensive but its worth it! <endOfText>
<human> lol, right! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family went on a cruise without me. I couldnt get the time off work. :/ <endOfText>
<human> Are you sad and all alone now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I am and it sucks. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you can find a new friend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A couple years ago where I live we had Hurricane Matthew aiming directly towards us. I was so worried, I was glued to the TV until we lost power, then to the radio! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what a worry that must have been. Did you have to evacuate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went to our county fair last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how fun!!! I bet you had a great time!!! I LOVE county fairs! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was riding my bike the other day, and passed all these flies hovering over a mutilated armidillo. <endOfText>
<human> sounds super gross! i bet you were a mess.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sounds super gross! i bet you were a mess. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it was pretty nasty.  Problem was I didn't even recognize what it was until I was right on top of it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats how it usually is then boom fly guts all over your helmet and clothes. <endOfText>
<human> Lol exactly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to go shopping. I really need a new purse. <endOfText>
<human> Where do you like to get your purses? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wherever they are the cheapest, but still of nice quality! I like a good deal. <endOfText>
<human> You sound like a smart and informed shopper. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Best way to be! <endOfText>
<human> You can use the left over money on so many other things! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought a boat for the river! <endOfText>
<human> Cool! That sounds like a lot of fun! I bet it will be a blast for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently moved far away and I have really been missing her. <endOfText>
<human> How far away is she ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy that I can take care of my family's needs now better than I could in the past. <endOfText>
<human> That is a good feeling. What has changed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to put my dog down at the vets due to a disease she had that wouldnt get better. It sucked. <endOfText>
<human> How old was your doggy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She was almost 8 years old. Not that old really. <endOfText>
<human> Did she have a disease? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was unloading the dishwasher and I guess not paying enough attention and dropped one of my good mixing bowls that busted all over the floor. It took so long to clean up. I was so mad at myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am so sorry!! I hate when something liek that happens. No one was injured? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no just my attitude. And my poor bowl. <endOfText>
<human> Well, I am glad no one was injured!!! Its a shame to lose great kitchenware though!! I hope you will be able to find a suitable replacement! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving down the interstate and a car almost hit me going 90 mph. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh. You must have been horrified. I can't even imagine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was and super upset! No blinker, didnt care, didnt even look! Kept right on going too <endOfText>
<human> Thank goodness you are ok though. That could have been really, really bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently hired a second person to work with me and I am optimistic they will help as sell more cars <endOfText>
<human> That's good news.  Did they have a good track record for sales in past jobs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone at work stole my phone yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> What!! That's awful oh my my goodness that's really pathetic  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What!! That's awful oh my my goodness that's really pathetic <endOfText>
<human> I know, right? I can't stand the people there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been craving ice cream for weeks and finally went to the store to get some only to find out they didnt have the kind I wanted! <endOfText>
<human> NOOOO! I've been there, and I feel your pain! What kind were you trying to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Chocolate peanut butter - haagen dazz brand. ( spelling probably wrong there! ) <endOfText>
<human> That sounds delicious and I'm going to have to try that! My personal favorite is Ben & Jerry's Phish Food. Now I want some. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The walk I was on today got a little dangerous at one point. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, really? What happened to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I flew into San Diego this morning, and when I got here my car reservation was never processed by the car rental company. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my that's a big problem. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview a few weeks ago, and I knew I was going to get it! I was really prepared. <endOfText>
<human> Well good for you.  What did you do to prepare yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read over the reviews on glassdoor and the typical questions they ask. <endOfText>
<human> Well good.  Did you get the job?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife told me she had some news for me the other day, she wanted to tell me she was pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome news congrats!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats awesome news congrats! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah we weren't reallllyyy trying, so it definitely wasn't expected, but still good news! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> even better honestly then you didnt have to deal with the stress of trying and it just came natural! <endOfText>
<human> That's a good point! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's almost time for my daughters to be home from school. I hope they have had a nice day. <endOfText>
<human> Is it the first day of school for them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just moved in and my neighbor asked to borrow my gate card real quick. I let her use it. <endOfText>
<human> Okay, but probably not a good idea in the long run. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt like she was a good person and just let her borrow it. She gave it back afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully, you've got a new friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my family out to the county fair last night. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a fun time! What did you guys do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds like a fun time! What did you guys do? <endOfText>
<human> We listened to some music, rode a few rides and saw the exhibits. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't expecting this, by when I woke up this morning on my birthday, my boyfriend informed me that he planned a trip to Califoria for us and that we are leaving today! <endOfText>
<human> I would be so excited!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would be so excited! <endOfText>
<human> Same here! It was a wonderful idea, and very impromptu! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, after 10 years of service at my job, they're going to lay me off. <endOfText>
<human> Wait, what?! That's unbelievable! Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The company is apparently downsizing...they say my name came up randomly. <endOfText>
<human> Riiiight...that's a stupid lie if I've ever heard one. Fight this if you can! After 10 years, they should be promoting you if anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got my kid a used car. I think it'll last her quite a while. <endOfText>
<human> That was smart to get a used one. I hope you got a good deal on it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won tickets to see my favorite band in concert the other day! <endOfText>
<human> That's freakin awesome! I never win anything, go you! What band is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's a band called Say Anything, I've been a fan of theirs since 2006! <endOfText>
<human> I love them!!! So jealous, hope you have a blast! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually spend Saturdays with my parents since my Fiance works most Saturdays. Football season is coming up and my parents always get season tickets to the football games on Saturdays. It is really going to stink not having anything to do once that starts up again. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a new hobby for the weekends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty bummed out. The vet told me I have to put my dog down. <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry to hear that. What is wrong with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a huge scholarship last year <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful!  They must be so happy and relieved also to not have to pay!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is wonderful!  They must be so happy and relieved also to not have to pay! <endOfText>
<human> yea i was very happy for him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a wonderful husband and two sweet kids. I'm feeling so much better from a horrible autoimmune flare. Life is good! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome, good for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks.  I know life is perfect but its a journey and I'm satisfied with where I am right now. <endOfText>
<human> well that is great, very hard thing to accomplish <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got startled while walking in my yard a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Strange place for something to surprise you. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once had to have teeth pulled, and I was given some crazy pill to take before coming to the appoinment because I hate dentists, and it made me act all funny. My mom video taped it and it is so funny but like stinks people saw me acting like a hooligan! <endOfText>
<human> oh wow, i hate when people record those type of videos. It's really not funny to me and very inconsiderate of that person! How embrassing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just celebrated my sons 14th birthday and can't believe he's growing up so fast. How is a man in my house all of a sudden? <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy! That must seem to fly by. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just returned from a trip to Canada, and I was so surprised by how friendly everyone was there! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I didn't know that! Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm about to move this weekend to a new city. I have everything packed and ready to go and have already cleaned the new house. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's exciting! A fresh start is always fun. What inspired you to make such a big change? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are so bad about bringing their dirty dishes to the sink and not rinsing them off. <endOfText>
<human> Aw man, kids can be SO lazy and don't like to do what they're supposed to. Have you tried a rewards system to get them to do what they have to, or are they too old for that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a car crash the other day on the road <endOfText>
<human> Oh no how terrible. Was anyone hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is out of town for work for the next few weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that must be kinda hard on you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I are going to couples counseling. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm sorry to hear you are going through a rough patch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got laid off from my job! I am floored! This will destroy me! <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that! Have you already filed for unemployment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat vomited on the couch today <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is your cat okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat vomited on the couch today which sucked <endOfText>
<human> Eew! My neighbor's cat used to puke on my bed - coughing up a furball. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just completed my first 12 mile Tough Mudder! I couldn't be more happy and pleased with myself! <endOfText>
<human> What is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend would not stop whistling even though she knows I can't stand it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask her to kindly stop?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes but she wouldn't. I was so irritated by it. <endOfText>
<human> She may not be the best choice of a friend if she likes annoying you so much.  Maybe try distancing yourself from her for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you ask her to kindly stop? <endOfText>
<human>  Yes but she wouldn't. I was so irritated by it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for my dream job last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool!  What would that be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been driving my little truck around for a while now, but I'm happy with it. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. As long as at gets you where you need to go. That's what matters. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Saw a guy drop his phone and kick it back into his hand <endOfText>
<human> lol that is impressive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother tripped me and made me fall. <endOfText>
<human> did you retaliate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I was at a store and thought I saw my friend at the checkout, so I was yelling her name over and over and trying to get over to her. It turned out not to be her and everyone was staring. ha ha. My face was so red. <endOfText>
<human> Haha!  That's hilarious from my perspective, but must have been embarrassing for you!  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at Target the other day with my daughter and I saw that they are selling Teddy Ruxpin that I used to have from the 80's! Man, that brought back some great memories! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!  I remember the commercials too!  He looked like the coolest toy out there!  Did your daughter like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rehearsed all night for my speech. <endOfText>
<human> Bet you're tired. What's the speech for/about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going wakeboarding this weekend for the 5th time this summer! I am really good at it and can do some flawless jumps! I wonder if I should go pro! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! Have you been practicing for a long time? I'm too much of a klutz to be able to do that so I respect you for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been cleaning and organizing the house all day. I had a bunch of trash in a huge bag and while I was walking up the basement stairs, it burst open and everything went flying back down. <endOfText>
<human> That's a real bummer. I bet you were pretty ticked off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard something scraping on my window last night. I got up to investigate. <endOfText>
<human> Scary!!! What was it?  Were you terrified or just curious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am allergic to lobster. <endOfText>
<human> There are a lot of people allergic to shellfish. That's a bummer though, lobster is good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend bought me a new puppy! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, animals are the best! What kind, and is it a boy or girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I accidentally dropped my brand new phone. The glass is now shattered. <endOfText>
<human> thats a bummer! do you not have a case on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so unfortunate about how ladies treat men's heart these days <endOfText>
<human> How do you mean? I guess it depends on the lady, does it not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently discovered that a coworker's decision have led to me having a big increase in my workload - it was super disappointing! <endOfText>
<human> I am very sorry! That is very frustrating! Can you speak with a supervisor about the situation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was moving furniture in between rooms and one of the bookcases fell apart. I got so ticked off. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I bet that did irritate you! It's bad enough moving, but you don't need your furniture falling apart on you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day I decided to dive of the big diving board at my pool. <endOfText>
<human> were you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In school I have a big test coming up. I am worried I will not be prepared in time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's always really stressful. Just do your best to prepare, and try not to worry about it. Whatever happens, happens, and if you're less stressed you'll probably do better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I shoplifted and got caught. <endOfText>
<human> ohh, gosh. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is very kind. Yesterday, she made a delicious cake for me. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice. What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to win today's tournament <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, I hope you win! What are you playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Table tennis. My colleagues are anticipating a failure, they don't know I have been practising for the past 8 months <endOfText>
<human> I bet you will do great!! It sounds like you have been practicing very hard and you have the desire. That is a winning combination!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my kids were young we used to make up our own games and have a lot of fun. They are all grown up now. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a nice memory, but we all grow old. Do you still spend time with them sometimes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One quiet night, I watched a movie on TV. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun. Was it a scary movie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family went to the zoo last weekend when the weather channel said it would be mostly a nice day. We are all fairly smart so just incase we brought unbrellas should the sky spontaneously fall on us. At one point it did, and we were not some of the many folks who were without umbrellas! <endOfText>
<human> What made you suspect that it might rain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an appointment next for the doctor and I might get some bad news. I am not sleeping well just thinking about it. <endOfText>
<human> I hate to hear that! I hope everything goes well and you get better news than you are expecting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend i played in a cornhole tournament i was extremely excited about my chances. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! But what is cornhole? I've never heard of it before! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Earlier this summer I had to have a biopsy of a suspicious mass, to determine if it was cancerous or not. There was a lot of waiting involved which made me very nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man!  That is my nightmare!  You must have been so worried!  Are you OK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor keeps parking his car in front of my house instead of his own and it obstruct my view of the park in front of my house. Man, it bothers me so much! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh that is so annoying! Have you confronted him about it yet?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh that is so annoying! Have you confronted him about it yet? <endOfText>
<human> Yes!  He just doesn't care though since it is technically a valid parking spot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my annual physical exam coming up. I have not been eating well and am worried the doctor will scold me. <endOfText>
<human> you should take the docs advise and get your health under control though, its important! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a dinner party at my friends house and I spilled red wine on a couch throw pillow! I flipped the pillow and quickly walked away without anyone seeing. Now, I feel really ashamed for not telling him. <endOfText>
<human> I would be so embarrassed. I would have probably done the same thing, but I would feel so guilty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited. My mom has decided to take our whole family on a cruise next Spring Break. <endOfText>
<human> That is great!  What a nice parent!  You must be pumped!  You should do something nice for her to show your appreciation! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I played in a tournament this weekend, i expected to win, and didnt. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry.  What kind of t <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month, I donated some amount to a charity. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome! what was the charity? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is potty training, and used the potty for the first time this week. <endOfText>
<human> ohh, that's great! Now he's ready to learn life lessons. ha ha! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with life right now. I have my family, shelter, food, and transportation. Can't complain! <endOfText>
<human> That is a wonderful attitude to have!  Being content and happy with your life is so important! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a Cirqe d' Sole show recently and was quite amazed by the different acts! I couldn't smiling while watching! Their skills were unbelievable! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun. I have always wanted to go to one of those shows. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a cornhole tourney this weekend, i feel i should have won but we choked. <endOfText>
<human> ohh that's bad. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back when I was in school, one day I felt really very mortified and red faced! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, what happened to cause this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest child just moved out if the house and into her dorm. <endOfText>
<human> Omg congrats :D <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's finally raining after weeks of hot humid weather, I'm so relieved. <endOfText>
<human> That would be nice. We need some rain too.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be nice. We need some rain too. <endOfText>
<human> I hope the weather takes a better turn for you guys soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in a hurricane zone. Every year it seems like hurricanes make my life miserable. <endOfText>
<human> that terrifying, i am scared to death of hurricanes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked hard coaching my pitchers all year, only to get smacked in the playoffs <endOfText>
<human> That's a real bummer. I am sure they benefited from your coaching even if they didn't win in the playoffs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everytime my cats run out of food I have to repeat to my fiance why they need a specific kind of food that happens to cost more then normal cat food. He just doesn't understand the brevity of the situation and why it would be so much cheaper to just buy the stupid food then to pay for a bunch of vet bills due to them not eating the certain food. <endOfText>
<human> Cats eat everything, they are not humans <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell bad about myself because I voted on Trump for president and I regret immensaly <endOfText>
<human> Oh well, you cant go back and change it now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feeling good about the economy these days. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, what do you find good about the economy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not have enough money to take my son back to school shopping. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry about that! Did your son start school already? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I saw my best with a very pretty girl. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice to hear. I hope they really like each other. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when I get to work in the morning and then realize I forgot to put any pants on. It is so awkward. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh! that's so awkward! What happened then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While everyone is hating on our current president out here, I stand by how I feel even if I do not fully agree to everything he does or says. Its called being loyal to ones country. <endOfText>
<human> That is so true. I agree with you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would never cheat on my wife like my brother cheated on his wife <endOfText>
<human> whoa yeah thats awful, i wouldnt either <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Madden comes out this friday and i can not wait <endOfText>
<human> I stop playing videogames years ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met someone the other day who said they are the grandson of Elvis. I believed him but now I am not so sure. <endOfText>
<human> Well, he is probably lying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure we are about to enter a economic recession in the near future. <endOfText>
<human> The economy is cyclical so it is bound to happen eventually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The braves are a young team with low expectations, and are awesome <endOfText>
<human> That is very true! They are very good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried my dog's health is failing. He doesn't move around that much any more and looks at me with sad eyes. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that! I hope your dog gets better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am always seeing these ASPCA and animal advocates commercials on TV and it makes me so sad. It is awful the way some humans can mistreat animals. Just horrible! <endOfText>
<human> Agree 100% it makes me want to adopt all the pets! Have you ever rescued an animal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my babies are rescues. My pit mix my fiance bought off the side of the road(wont get into that). My husky, I got from someone who got her from a breeder that just didnt want her, and my 2 cats were like living outside and undomesticated. So they all are in a sense. <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing. I have a rescue myself and I will never have a pet any other way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tornadoes are extremely terrifying and i experienced it first hand <endOfText>
<human> Yes they are. I live in Oklahoma and we deal with them all the time. I have seen some really bad ones. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this year. She is a National Honor Society student. This is such a huge accomplishment. <endOfText>
<human> That is very impressive! my brother in law is starting his senior year as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being a chargers fan is tough, finally some national recognition <endOfText>
<human> Ha, you'll have to enlighten me as I don't know much about the Chargers. Are they usually not a good team or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter competed in her first cheerleading competition last week. She did so good and her team got second place. <endOfText>
<human> Thats wonderful! Congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My team had low expectations this year, and we made the playoffs and won region <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Was this the first year this particular team was together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> technically no, but its high school sports so every year new players come and others go <endOfText>
<human> Gotcha. Why low expectations, did you not do well last year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A pitcher on my team signed with a big time college <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. I bet you really helped him develop his talent. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't find my favorite handkerchief my grandfather gave me. I am fearful that I could have lost it. <endOfText>
<human> thats a horrible feeling, especially something sentimental  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats a horrible feeling, especially something sentimental <endOfText>
<human> It means so much to me because he is now passed away. I would be so upset if I can't find it. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I'm very joyful for my wonderful and supporting family, they have helped me through a lot <endOfText>
<human> a great family makes all the difference, and can get you through anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I prepared rice and fish stew for my dinner date with my new girl <endOfText>
<human> That is so great that you're cooking for her!  Did she love it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She loved it. I couldn't believe it turned out right because I saw the recipe on youtube and tried it out <endOfText>
<human> Oh good!  You must be so proud too!  I love watching youtube recipes!  I'm so glad it turned out for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend just turned around the other day and proposed to me while we were taking a walk! <endOfText>
<human> You must be the luckiest girl on earth <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently on a mule ride in the Grand Canyon of Arizona! I really had to put a lot of faith in the mule though, because there were a bunch of sheer drops on the trail! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! Is it hard to ride a mule? I've always heard they are stubborn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this weekend i play in a tourney i think i can win <endOfText>
<human> That's neat, whats the tournament for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was super impressed when France won the world cup, I didn't see that coming! <endOfText>
<human> i didnt either! i though germany would repeat <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sad that my favorite TV show Seinfeld isn't on anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Why would they take it off air? it was a great show <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the braves had a chance to take over first place today, and lost the first game of a DH <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That really stinks! I know how that feels. We like the Red Sox here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to see my wife for the first time in a week tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting! I bet you can't wait to spend time with her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought a new vehicle and I'm so surprised at how much better it drives than my old one. <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Nothing better than driving a smooth new car!  What kind did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my sister in law is pregnant which is so exciting, but she has had a miscarriage before so I'm just trying to stay positive for her and I know things will go well. <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting! I hope everything goes well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so thankful for my mother-in-law. She recently sent us a great feast of food out of the blue. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how nice. Is she always doing nice things? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud I graduated from college, didn't think I was going to make it there for a second. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome i am really proud, college is really important for your future <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids go back to school next week and I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> lol some free time! what grades? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> all those fires in cali are heartbreaking <endOfText>
<human> Yes they are. It's a shame how dry it is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Fortnite is a free game, and the number 1 played game. the developers are geniuses <endOfText>
<human> I have heard about that game. Is it a role playing game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran out of the house into the street the other day. Luckily my neighbor was there and caught him for me. <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness, i would freak if my dog ran out, he is like another child of ours <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my coworker comes into work late everyday and it drives me crazy <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy, does your boss not care? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when it's late at night and it's just me up watching T.V..  So lonely. <endOfText>
<human> i wish i could stay up late and just watch tv alone some times. i don't have any alone time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for when winter arrives. I'm already buying warmer clothes. <endOfText>
<human> I love winter and wearing sweaters and jeans. This summer heat is too much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my brother a lot when I let him use my car, he's not the most responsible but he knows I care about it. <endOfText>
<human> You are more trusting then I am. I don't even trust my wife in my car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> today i went to get madden, and the store didnt have enough copies <endOfText>
<human> that is not good, did you manage to get it done somewhere eles? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> unfortunately not i have to wait until friday now <endOfText>
<human> that is not good i really hope you can get it done on friday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait to start playing madden online friday, i tend to be very good <endOfText>
<human> Oh the new one comes out on Friday? I used to play it back in college a bit with my roommates. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am just feeling generally happy at the moment, mostly just to have what I need to live and being healthy. <endOfText>
<human> great health and being well off is a blessing, i too am grateful for tha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm grateful for the community I live in.  Everyone is so friendly! <endOfText>
<human> i live in a small town too. i grew up in a big city so the change is very welcome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i don't know if i have a busy day coming up the next day the unknown drives me crazy <endOfText>
<human> I can relate to that, the late night anxiety of the unknown. Hate that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my grandma has major back surgery next week, i feel so bad for her <endOfText>
<human> oh no. is she alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked all day in the sun and didn't put socks on before putting my boots on. Boy did I regret that later in the day when I took them off! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, did you put your socks on after you put your boots on? That must of been awkward getting your socks dirty.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man, did you put your socks on after you put your boots on? That must of been awkward getting your socks dirty. <endOfText>
<human> I washed my feet immediately after the smell hit me! Never sweat in boots without socks to soak some of it up! It <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I drive past malls, I always get nostalgic about all the times going there as a kid to play in the arcade. <endOfText>
<human> I can relate. I wish I still enjoyed them as much as I did way back then. Now I'm either out of place of it's a ghost town. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ive been waiting for months for the new madden, it finally comes out friday <endOfText>
<human> Heck yeah! I myself have never been into madden, more of a NBA2k guy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm faithful I'm going down the right career path for once in my life, so I'm excited for that. <endOfText>
<human> that is a great feeling, what are you pusuing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never know how joyful I was going to be until I tried <endOfText>
<human> i understand that for sure, finishing a task is a great feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea, passing my most difficult exam and getting certified gave me great joy <endOfText>
<human> congrats! was it for college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> if the redsox continue their pace, they will break the record for wins! <endOfText>
<human> Yes I love them they deserve to win <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was terrified when we had a major ice storm, our electricity was out for weeks! <endOfText>
<human> oh no! we went through the same thing last december <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son used the pottty for the first time <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, looks like you guys will be saving a lot of money from no more diapers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's sad for me to think about my parents growing old and not how I once remembered them. <endOfText>
<human> i know the feeling, it makes you wish time would slow down <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> seeing my son grow so fast isnt easy <endOfText>
<human> I don't have any kids, but I can only imagine.  It even seems like I'm growing old fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband helps with housework and cooking <endOfText>
<human> that's great! what a good husband <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an issue with a package never arriving at my door... thankfully the company had great customer service and replaced it right away <endOfText>
<human> that's great. it stinkswhen you have to worry about customer service giving you a hard time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been wondering how it feels to be without someone <endOfText>
<human> It must feel lonely, for sure, but maybe they cope with it in different ways. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised to see my wife actually cook dinner at home! <endOfText>
<human> why is that buddy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pleasantly shocked to get a visit from my brother the other day. Made me happy to see him after such a long time. <endOfText>
<human> How long has it been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently started working out daily and I was so anxious my first day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's a great habit to have. Did you go to the gym? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt guilty the other day for forgetting a close friend's birthday, just totally lost track of time. <endOfText>
<human> I don't think I have ever remembered a single friends birthday until facebook was created. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend lost his car to an accident that wasn't his fault, so I lent him $10,000 to buy a used vehicle so he can get back and forth to work. I'm confident he'll pay me back like he promised. <endOfText>
<human> You are very trusting. I'd just assume give my kidney to someone as 10k. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> there have been many instances of attempted abductions near me recently <endOfText>
<human> Who is carrying them out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this weekend i found an old pyrex like my mom used to have <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. I bet it brought back memories of your mom in the kitchen using it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my wife begins her masters program this month! <endOfText>
<human> Oh  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yep she is going to be a school counselor <endOfText>
<human> sorry, i accidentally sent that first message early.  that is great that she is going back to school.  I bet you are so proud of her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's always sad for me to see a friend from work, leave and get a new job. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that is pretty tough. Especially when you really like to work together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I bake cookies I end up eating most of them. I feel bad because there are never enough for the rest of the family. <endOfText>
<human> You must be a good cookie chef! Don't feel too bad, they should have been quicker! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we are going to mexico, and its shocking to see all the homicides there now <endOfText>
<human> For vacation? And yeah, the rates are pretty high, hopefully you won't be in those areas. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hurricane season is starting up and I'm a little worried about what it'll produce. <endOfText>
<human> i grew up in miami so i know how you feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother is in rehab after 2 months in the hospital <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Is it drugs or alcohol? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family has been gone all day and I drank everything in the fridge. I feel pretty guilty. <endOfText>
<human> What did you drink specifically?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did you drink specifically? <endOfText>
<human> Lemonade and sprite.  The only drinks we buy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its a shame the way some people act towards the U.S <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I wish all the countries would get along. No need to be mean to each other. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going for a walk in the neighborhood and I felt something drop on my head. <endOfText>
<human> that is intense! what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She is as caring as mother Theresa <endOfText>
<human> Did she take care of a bunch of dying kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm proud of the college I graduated from, it's no Ivy league school but I loved it. <endOfText>
<human> What school did you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just picked up a 6-pack at the grocery store but I am not a happy camper. <endOfText>
<human> Why not?  How can you not be happy with a 6-pack? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won tickets to a concert and when we got there, they were supposed to have the tickets at the box office and they didn't so the refused us no matter how much proof we gave that we won. It was ridiculous! <endOfText>
<human> thats insane!! were you able to get in? and what concert? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the crime rate where i live is increasing, its horrible to think about <endOfText>
<human> Seriously.  I was looking it up the other day thinking about moving somewhere else and that state was even worse.  Then to read about everything that makes the crime rate is overwhelmingly scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm 800 miles from my family <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is very far away. Do you get to visit often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I am laying in bed at night I hear noises coming from my closet. I am fearful there could be something in there. <endOfText>
<human> that happened to me once i almost died. my heart was racing and then boom out pops my cat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a much higher grade on my quiz than I expected, so I am happy. <endOfText>
<human> What was the subject? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got a new shotgun the other day due to the fact crime around me is increasing <endOfText>
<human> That is good that you have something to protect yourself with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just heard a friend from work is switching shifts so we are no longer going to be working together. Bummer. <endOfText>
<human> Did they choose to switch themselves or was it out of their control? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got first place at his very first spelling bee! <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Sounds like he's a smart kid! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hopefully our government can turn around the hate and turmoil that is in the country <endOfText>
<human> That would be good. There is so much vitriol happening in society these days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while ago I borrowed some money from my brother's wallet. I have been meaning to pay it back but keep forgetting. <endOfText>
<human> It is really eating me up inside. I will make sure to pay it back with my next paycheck. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know very well that I locked the door before I left I wonder how they got in <endOfText>
<human> who got in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the  athletic championship is close <endOfText>
<human> Ok, who is competing you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the indoor athletics <endOfText>
<human> Nice, will check it up, i love indoor athletics as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was hoping to be able to go visit family soon but i don't think it's going to happen <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I'm sorry, why can't you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm terrified of when the tornado sirens go off.  Always feels like it'll for sure hit my house. <endOfText>
<human> i grew up with hurricanes and those are terrifying i can imagine tornados <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to have a baby soon, our third child! I am ecstatic! I think we're done after 3 though. ha ha. <endOfText>
<human> Wow the trifecta! Congratulations on that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a health check coming up tomorrow, but I am a bit nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> I never liked those either.  Do you have any health problems that would make you dread it?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never liked those either.  Do you have any health problems that would make you dread it? <endOfText>
<human> Not really (I think). Just the whole process is something that makes me nervous, perhaps foolishly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am envious of my best friend. He has a sick car with a phat stereo system. <endOfText>
<human> Do you at least get to ride in it with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> An old friend that I hadn't talked to since I was a young teenager recently added me on FaceBook and we had a nice caht. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. It's nice how social media can reconnect people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of people who get to live in a warm climate all year long. <endOfText>
<human> Oh trust me, there's nothing to be jealous about! The heat is KILLER where I live. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rode a plane for the first time last week and was terrified when we hit some pretty bad turbulence. <endOfText>
<human> That's always scary, the plane starts shaking and you immediately think "We're going down!" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was with my family over the weekend, and I started feeling happy and a little teary eyed about our time together. <endOfText>
<human> Do you not see them much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was furious today when I heard my dental bill was going to be three times more than what I expected! <endOfText>
<human> oh no. that is horrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was waiting all week for saturday morning and i got great weather. i was extactic <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, what did you do to take advantage of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a lawyer in order to prove my point that my client forgot his car and mistakenly enter someone else's car I had to leave my zipper open after going to the washroom and I was not embarrased about it <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is interesting. Did you win the case? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfather passed. He was very sick <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear about this, may his soul rest in peace <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. He has been gone for a while now, but it still hurts as if it was yesterday <endOfText>
<human> May his soul rest in peace and his memories live on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had some birthday cake from my husband's party this past weekend in the fridge, and I ate the last piece because I was craving chocolate like crazy! I feel so bad now. <endOfText>
<human> Well it was there for you. If someone else wanted it they would have been there first! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son gave his first flute recital last week. He did great and got a standing ovation. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful!  That is a difficult instrument to master.  Was he nervous beforehand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got home and my husband had mowed, cleaned, and got dinner ready <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a productive evening! What did you cook? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get anxious whenever I'm at the airport and I'm waiting in the security line and the plane is about to board. <endOfText>
<human> i do too, flying is kinda nervewracking  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i do too, flying is kinda nervewracking <endOfText>
<human> I agree, seems like you have to plan to be there hours before it takes off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was speeding while on my way home from work and I got a ticket. I was only going like two miles over the speed limit! <endOfText>
<human> That stinks but I guess the law is the law. Are you going to fight it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I was speeding, but its just stupid that I got a ticket when everyone else around me was speeding too. <endOfText>
<human> I know how that feels but I guess they have to pick someone and it was just your bad luck day. It can always be worse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife took a real plunge the other day, she quit her job and decided to start a practice of her own! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of practice is it? That takes a lot of guts! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the days when I lived at home with my parents. I miss my mom's cooking and reading me bedtimes stories. <endOfText>
<human> Does it make you feel good to at least think about those times though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Grandma just passed away. Its been a brutally tough time. <endOfText>
<human> oh my god i'm so sorry. i've only got one grandparent left and it's tough to even imagine not having her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i made it to work early and was able to get ready before people started coming in <endOfText>
<human> That is always a wonderful feeling to be prepared and ready to go.  Are you a morning person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why should I not be jealous, how can a guy that is not educated any more than a masters degree holder <endOfText>
<human> You shouldn't be jealous. There is no need for that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous going to the dmv. I hate going there <endOfText>
<human> Did you have to take a test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was glad when my dad retired. He deserved it <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. Is he enjoying retirement <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually keep only professional relationships at work. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel like that helps or hinders your personal life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i walked out of the house and heard a rustling in the brush and found a deer running up the hill <endOfText>
<human> How beautiful! They are so much bigger when I see them than I think they are going to be.  My parents house has some land and when I bring my kids over there, we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How beautiful! They are so much bigger when I see them than I think they are going to be.  My parents house has some land and when I bring my kids over there, we can see the young bucks eating the grass in their backyard. <endOfText>
<human> they are so majestic it's amazing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is doing so well in school that she flew through 3rd grade a year early and is starting 4th grade next week. I'm amazing at how well she's doing! <endOfText>
<human> that is amazing. children can amazing you if you give them the opportunity <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just love seafood buffets <endOfText>
<human> Why's that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my pet turtle recently. He probably escaped my yard. I am so sad he is gone! <endOfText>
<human> That is very sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not sure about the dmv. I did not want to go there <endOfText>
<human> Get ready to wait for a long time. DMVs are terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter decided to play waitress with her food and hold the plate over her head. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I think I know where this is going. How did she manage as a waitress? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was looking thru some old photo albums. it's so crazy to see how everyone has changed <endOfText>
<human> How have they changed the most?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How have they changed the most? <endOfText>
<human> the kids have grown so much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What do they do now? <endOfText>
<human> go to school. they are just older <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt weird when i didnt have the money to pay for dinner <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up washing dishes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend wants to have a <endOfText>
<human> a what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid of frogs. I know that is weird but they have always scared me. <endOfText>
<human> Actually my aunt is afraid of them also. She said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her. Why are you scared of them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do thou like enjoy frog legs. <endOfText>
<human> Strange. Next time you have them try them cooked in goose liver fat and scotch. AMAZING! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Actually my aunt is afraid of them also. She said as a girl one cornered her and wanted to hurt her. Why are you scared of them? <endOfText>
<human> I do thou like enjoy frog legs.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My fiance works as a technician installing internet at peoples homes, and they are always tipping him. Often with food and it makes me nervous sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry about that. Dont be nervous though. He is a loyal person I bet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I mean he wont let me eat anything people give him but I wish he would just toss stuff, you never know what kind of people are out there. Especially if they are upset with the company he is working for. <endOfText>
<human> What is the name of the company? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty hopeful this year for my college football team to place top 5! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what team is that you are rooting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School starts for me in a couple of weeks. <endOfText>
<human> college?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> college? <endOfText>
<human> Yep. I am a junior this year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh wow thats great. <endOfText>
<human> I have everything I need too. I have never been so ready <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to get out early from work on friday <endOfText>
<human> Big plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a lot of faith in the community I live in; everyone seems like a good person. <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice, we don't get a lot of that these days. Makes me kind of miss the old days when people had a real sense of community. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my sister and her husband are going on a 15 day cruise. Its torture to hear! <endOfText>
<human> Why is it torture?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why is it torture? <endOfText>
<human> I haven't been on a vacation in about 8 years.  I really want to go too! I'm excited for her but it does make me feel miserable when I think about it. Such is life though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im 800 miles from my family and i miss them <endOfText>
<human> That must be pretty lonely. Do you talk often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered food today and weirded out the delivery guy went I went downstairs to pick it up <endOfText>
<human> how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son counted all the way to thirty today <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's great! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it felt good to care fo my sisters dog <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of you. Is it a small dog or large? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not want to go to school on Monday. <endOfText>
<human> Why, what is happening on Monday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty content with my family life right now. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, are you married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My a/c went out the other day, and I knew I wasn't gonna be able to fix it. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer, at least it didn't go out in the beginning of summer, I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of people born with perfect healthy genetics. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it sucks when people just seem to have it all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY best friend said she was staying home last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> was there a reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i heard my wife and twins were in a car accident i didnt know what to think <endOfText>
<human> OH no! Were they okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY light bill was doubled last month. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's horrible. Any idea why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently moved to a new place and currently don't know many people, so it's a bummer. <endOfText>
<human> You should find the local cafe or something <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister and I used to chase the ice cream truck when we were kids. <endOfText>
<human> i used to get screwballs with my sister. those were our favorites  as kids <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> IT is. <endOfText>
<human> i love sharing memories with my sister <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i ordered pizza with my husband and it was totally underwhelming <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm flying on a plane tomorrow. I hope it goes wheels up and wheels down with no trouble... But it's the first time I've flown, and I'm pretty sure any sign of turbulence is just going to make me want to hurl. Plus, I'm worried about getting lost in an airport! <endOfText>
<human> what is with the book you are writing? people dont chat like that. yea christmas list <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt buy a gift my daughter wanted the other day <endOfText>
<human> ah, bummer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Starting my first day as a kindergarten teacher soon. I have my supplies, my lesson plan, have asked all the experienced teachers for tips, have set up my classroom... Think I'm ready to start my career handling the future of our society. It's going to be nerve-wracking to start, though <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will do just fine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my phone in the toilet. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear about that. Is it still working alright, or under warranty? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was lonely on Monday. I was sick all day <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am deathly afraid of rollercoasters <endOfText>
<human> I am too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss living in the city <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can understand that. Everything is right at your doorsteps. <endOfText>
<human> MY friends are so far away now. We hardly ever see each other. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad the other day when i saw someone had put a huge dent in my car door! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took care of my cat this weekend, He was a little sick <endOfText>
<human> did you take him to the vet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two-year-old niece is getting better and better with his manners. We had to pull him from his parents, and volunteered to take care of him, because they were failing as parents. But he's surprisingly picking up on how to have more appropriate, normalized behavior, and I'm happy about it <endOfText>
<human> Little kids are pretty amazing how they can pick things like that up in the right environment. So nice you are teaching him good manners, those are in short supply in adults these days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know, I really feel great about taking my certification boards. <endOfText>
<human> What is it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting my certificate to be a Physician Assistant. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool. I am a Pharmacy Tech <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids were up all night. <endOfText>
<human> THAT must have been a nightmare. How many do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish my husband didn't have to go on his business trip today. <endOfText>
<human> where is he going and for how long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw this guy eat a 3 lbs burger today for lunch and i was impressed <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's huge! I wonder if he got sick afterward? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so blessed to be able to have a car. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are, it is nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to pass my drivers test. I knew I would do well <endOfText>
<human> That is great. When did you take the test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like to learn and I'm so ready to go back to school. I can't wait for classes to start! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! What are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Physics. I'm in my senior year so I can really explore the complicated subjects now. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that subject was always tough for me in school. Good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I got home today I realized someone had parked in my parking spot. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I have met the one <endOfText>
<human> Really? Congratulations! I hope you guys are really happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the best friends. <endOfText>
<human> thats good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am basking in my new found love even though my parent seem to see things differently <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is a pickle. Congrats on the new love. Why might your parent not approve? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They want an American with blue eyes, educated in Yale but I am in love with a boy from a Tanzania <endOfText>
<human> Ah they had certain expectations, I see. Well, you can't help who you fall in love with. Hopefully they will support you in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a sudden visit from a friend of mine from another country recently. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, I hope he enjoy his/her stay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is swimming underwater at 2 years old, amazing! <endOfText>
<human> Did you teach him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am cooking dinner for my boyfriend for the first time tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Something yummy I'm sure. Are you nervous?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something yummy I'm sure. Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<human> Im going to make chicken parm. IT one dish I do well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so tired of tell my daughter the same thing over and over. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I know how that feels. I think it is part of growing up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was outside I saw a black cat cross the street. I am superstitious and am now scared something bad will happen to me. <endOfText>
<human> I believe in that too.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe in that too. <endOfText>
<human> Well I will have to be very careful when I do things. I don't want to get injured or anything like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until December. <endOfText>
<human> Christmas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have court on thursday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a speeding ticket. I can't pay it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I hope everything goes okay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The mosquitos are terrible this year. No matter what they keep buzzing around my head. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! Have you tried spraying lemon etc on yourself or eating them? Helps me a lot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious when my brother got his new job. I kind of wanted it <endOfText>
<human> I can understand the feeling. What job did he get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to spank my two-year-old niece today. He wasn't listening and kept doing the same mistake over and over, defying me. I don't like to be physical, and I'm sure others would look down on it, but I didn't feel like I had a choice. <endOfText>
<human> I think the right amount of spanking is OK.  I was spanked as a child and know I deserved it.  Hopefully you didn't take it to far though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got around to watching the Black Panther movie. It was a real let down for me I I don't get what all the hype was about. <endOfText>
<human> I still have yet to see it. I hate how hype affects things. I wish you could always get to things before they become really pumped up.I bet if you watch again sometime later, you'll find it a little better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little brother is about to enter high school in a week. Makes me remember the years I was in it. It wasn't all bad, but it definitely wasn't all good. I wouldn't mind re-living that period for a little bit though <endOfText>
<human> I get it, I think I'd like to go back and relive the big events. I miss those the most, football games and dances. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got gas tonight because I didn't want to run out in the morning before work. I'm usually rushing around so it'll be nice not to have that worry tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> My girlfriend always likes to wait until the needle is past empty. I never let it get past half-way empty. I don't get how she deals with that stress in her life! And to me, it makes no sense. But I guess she hates spending the money on it, so she waits. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feed the birds that come to my home everyday <endOfText>
<human> Well that's nice of you to do that for them. I bet they enjoy the treat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor just got a new car and it's gorgeous. I wish I could have a car that nice. <endOfText>
<human> They might've taken out a loan they can't afford. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time my kids take a nap I do someting terrible. <endOfText>
<human> What's that? Drink? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Bad or Genius? <endOfText>
<human> you know what? it's freakin genius! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a video of child abuse today and it reminded me of the abuse someone I know went through as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds awful. I am sorry you had to see that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I play the lottery sometimes here, and finally won a small amount. Not a big deal, but I was shocked it finally happened haha. <endOfText>
<human> I would be too, I never win those things! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it's really demoralizing until you at least win something. A nice little bonus anyway. <endOfText>
<human> Very true! Congrats! It's hard to never win <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate waiting, especially on grades. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I'm sure it makes you anxious. But, no sense in worrying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad about the past this morning. I hate then when you wake up and remember a lot of bad things that happened over the past few years <endOfText>
<human>  Cheer up buddy, it's all in the mind <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cheer up buddy, it's all in the mind <endOfText>
<human> If only- Lots of trauma the past year especially..That's not something that is easy to forgot or get over. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can one stay married for 10 years without cheating? <endOfText>
<human> By being a decent person...I'm not a cheater and could never..I am very monogomous..Why would you get married if you wanted that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ok, I think I am just being scared and finding an excuse <endOfText>
<human> I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that, would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you don't like it the way it is. Cheating after 10 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 10 years only to go through such a betrayal. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a terrible first day of juinor high <endOfText>
<human> what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to see that my dog found his way back home! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How long was he gone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling better about the future off and on today. It's always a feeling I try to hold on too. <endOfText>
<human> That is a good feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my brother moved home. I missed him <endOfText>
<human> I bet! I am glad you have a good relationship with a sibling! That's rarer nowadays <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to eat nachos later. <endOfText>
<human> I love shrimp nachos, but any nachos are good really <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have a job currently. So today, I robbed an old lady. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's really extreme. You should feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave up dieting a long time ago, and I'm far happier and losing weight slowly <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that! I actually attempted a diet about a month ago, and it was miserable. What made you give it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a guy picking his nose in his car a stop light the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Did you roll down your window and yell at him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Gagging? So you don't do that? <endOfText>
<human> hahahahahahahaha, classic! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a taste for some pizza today so I asked my daughter to put one in the oven <endOfText>
<human> I love pizza <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thankful my brother helped me move. It was needed <endOfText>
<human> Its hard to find people to help move. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped on my dog's tail accidentally earlier and I felt really bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> was he hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it upset me when i saw my food was taken out of the fridge at work today <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you end up finding out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends went to a bar tonight and I didn't get to go. <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom brought me my favorite salad and cheesecake yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds delicious! How nice of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm entering a music contest with my friends. This is our first! <endOfText>
<human> What is the name of your band? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone is gone for the night. I haven't been alone at night in forever <endOfText>
<human> Where'd they go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought another pair of shoes today. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of shoes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Converse. I was getting school shoes for the kids and I just had to get a pair for myself. <endOfText>
<human> Converse go with everything too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep seeing everyone at the beach, I want to go to the beach! <endOfText>
<human> I love the beach. We can only go once a year! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my cat passed away. He was so sick <endOfText>
<human> That is sad. Sometime pets are iirreplaceable. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife told yesterday that she doesn't love me anymore and she want a divorce. I felt totally destroyed. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, that is terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My softball team just lost the season championship by 1 run in extra innings.  I am so disappointed. <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that. what age group <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait to see if i got a raise on my next paycheck <endOfText>
<human> That would be great.  They don't tell you in advance, you just have to find out when you get the check? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally found a music streaming link that plays fairly new music and not just the same thing repeatedly. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice, the ones I use play the same songs over and over! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to try to start my old broken lawn mower today and it wouldn't start, it made me VERY angry about my nice one being stolen <endOfText>
<human> I'd be mad too! Do you have any idea who could have stolen it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was some weird scraping noise at my window earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Don't go check! lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had to send my plate back at the restaurant today <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend just got a new car. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow! what did they get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried all night when I found out Trump won the election. <endOfText>
<human> Why he is so much better then the other option. I mean they were all crazy but I can't imagine a regime under Clinton.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why he is so much better then the other option. I mean they were all crazy but I can't imagine a regime under Clinton. <endOfText>
<human> They were tears of joy, trust me if Clinton had won it would of been tears of fear. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw a big dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> I would hate that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy my dad got me a truck for school. It was a nice gesture <endOfText>
<human> oh thats sweet. is he paying for insurance too? :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always lie to my boyfriend about how much money I have. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got mad when I almost got evicted. My landlord is the worst <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been getting everything ready to apply to grad school. <endOfText>
<human> awesome! What are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new dog who was starved is getting a bit on my nerves today. I am just a little cranky today and she is finally having energy and being a handful <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear about your dog, did you rescue her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I came home early and I discovered my wife cheating on me. I felt totally destroyed. <endOfText>
<human> jesus lord...I hope you kicked her out or left! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep seeing a little black and white kitty running around who is hungry. <endOfText>
<human> Did you call an animal shelter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My stomach was feeling yucky today and I accidentally passed gas during the staff meeting! <endOfText>
<human> OH no! Did every one hear? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think they did. If they didn't hear it they definitely smelled it. <endOfText>
<human> That's so bad lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY ids still love going to school. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I wish mine did but they're dreading their first day back tomorrow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got a scrapbook from my brother of all of our old pics together. Brought back some good memories. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats good.. did you get to keep some pictures? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep, he made a copy of everything so I have a complete set now. <endOfText>
<human> wow that was a good idea <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was disappointing when i didnt get the job i applied for <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am sorry to hear that, but I am sure there might be an even better one out there for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think I want to meet this person to purchase a couch off of Craigslist, something seems off about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's never a fun situation, I always bring someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw someone had taken my food from the fridge at work <endOfText>
<human> The entitlement everywhere is terrible! Did you find out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Upset with my neighbor who used to like animals..and IDK if he is on drugs or has a mental illness but he acted like he was going to hit the dog <endOfText>
<human> did you call the cops? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My really good vaccuum cleaner broke last week! I was so bummed, but then my brother in law offered to fix it for me and I am so happy he did. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! Mine broke too this past weekend but I got a new one as it was just a cheap dirt devil. I am glad yours is fixed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone I know was nasty to me again after trying to build trust. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man doesn't that just make you want to take a car and run right..... Just kidding.. but yeah that would make my blood boil <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can just imagine what gets every so happy at Christmas <endOfText>
<human> I love Christmas <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still look at my kids baby photos <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean because I do it too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Came home tonight and there was an owl in my house.. My cat had dragged an owl through the dog door, but didn't kill it. Safe to say I almost ruined my pants, if you know what I mean. <endOfText>
<human> But now you have a new pet to live with you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now! <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear.  What is making you so happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to dog-watch my neighbors dogs this weekend. It was really easy, and I stayed at her house during the day since she was out of town, and it was peaceful and let me get work done. When she came back, she gave me $100! I would have done it for free. She's too nice. <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of her. What did you do with the money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it made me mad to see someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Ugh I hate when people do that! Did they even leave a note? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a 6 piece chicken nugget from McDonald's today and got 7 nuggets! <endOfText>
<human> oh wow.. i call that a win! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I yelled at my toddler earlier because he wasn't listening but I think I went a little overboard with it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it can be easy for that to happen in the spur the moment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away a week ago. I live alone, and he was the only person that kept me company when I came home at night. Apartment feels so quiet and lifeless without him around. <endOfText>
<human> aww. i can imagine that its really different now in the house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up feeling down today. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. What's been going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my kid loves to play with stupid model cars and stupid tiny legos. Well he didn't clean them up and this morning I rolled out of bed tired and walked to the kitchen and stepped on a stupid lego! <endOfText>
<human> Oh NO...That should be reserved for the worst prisoners. That hurts! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a bit upset today that the man who has lived here for a couple years has this house falling down around him and isn't fixing anything. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no no no no no! Thats no man! If you aren't going to fix it then earn money to hire someone who will! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever have those mornings where old memories come up..or old traumas..and it just makes you feel so bad. <endOfText>
<human> yea it can really hit hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job last week <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life now. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had my first child and my marriage is thriving. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I lied to a friend. I just didnt want to hang out <endOfText>
<human> I have been there before. Sometimes you just need to relax! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been getting everything ready for grad school and I think I  finally have all that I need. <endOfText>
<human> what are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait to see my new raise on my next paycheck <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! Are you going to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has been playing Roblox and I am fascinated by how detailed the game is! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of game is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to do well on my test. I studied all week <endOfText>
<human> And what was the verdict? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was such a pretty day, it reminds me of my childhood and playing outside. <endOfText>
<human> I love days like that! Hopefully you got a chance to play outside?!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love days like that! Hopefully you got a chance to play outside?! ;-) <endOfText>
<human> I did, me and my kids had a picnic at the beach and had a blast just like the old days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm impressed with how far technology has came in the last 10 years! <endOfText>
<human> yes technology is great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it irked me when i saw my brother coming into the house <endOfText>
<human> Why did it irk you? was he not suppose to be there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew I was going to pass my drivers test. its all I wanted <endOfText>
<human> Did you not pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had my son and it was the best experience of my life. <endOfText>
<human> Kids are the best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a hole in the sole of my only pair of shoes. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's no good, are you going to buy new ones or patch them up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm ashamed to be 28 and still really into gaming. <endOfText>
<human> Nothing to be ashamed about.  There are lots of people much older that are still into gaming.  If you're really good you could actually make money on it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworkers chipped together to buy me lunch, because I forgot mine and they know I can't afford to buy lunch. <endOfText>
<human> that was really nice of them , they are good co workers  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that was really nice of them , they are good co workers <endOfText>
<human> They are incredible. I cried and they got really embarassed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait to go see my grandfather in December. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting! Are you going to see him for the holidays? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have had so much to get together for my grad school application. <endOfText>
<human> What school are you applying to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm doing laundry and packing my clothes to fly to see my long distance girlfriend tomorrow. Even though I just saw her a month ago, I'm really looking forward to the trip. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool.  How long have you been together in this relationship <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was supposed to meet me at my apartment so we could eat at Starbucks.  But she ended up wanting a full body back rub.  It was a nice change of plans. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's...interesting. That does sound like a nice change of plans, not only because Starbucks not seem that fun anyway. Hopefully she returned the favor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a puppy and I have wanted one forever, life isn't fair! <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you get one then, so cute. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally moved out of my home, because the neighbors are so annoying. <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. Maybe they will take the hint? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a big presentation at work and I crushed it. I was so prepared! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I must admit that I have not been a very good father, I feel bad <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt paid for college my first year. It was so nice of her <endOfText>
<human> She must have a golden heart <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad music is more freely accessible now. When I was younger, everything was at least $10 if i wanted to listen to an album. <endOfText>
<human> yea, this is a much better time for content <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home alone last weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did anything happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It hurt me when my brother moved away. I could not handle it <endOfText>
<human> Do you guys still keep in touch with video chats and phone calls? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ruined my moms anniversary party. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion I worked so hard for. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Are you going to tell your boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i left the store today and didnt take a case of drinks out from the bottom of the cart while paying <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. Did you do it on purpose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We got to go to a game last weekend. I was so excited <endOfText>
<human> how was the game! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive when lebron signed with the lakers <endOfText>
<human> Why were you impressed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a kitten hurt on the side of the road... unfortunately I was in a taxi and couldn't stop to help it <endOfText>
<human> That would have made me sad , poor kitten  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would have made me sad , poor kitten <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that was a few years ago and it still makes me sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one time on my birthday i never expect much to me is just a regular day , then i get a package in the mail it was copic markers my friend mailed them to me from another state i was so happy <endOfText>
<human> wow surprise gifts are the best! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid <endOfText>
<human> I do as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I looked out for my brother last weekend. He was very sick <endOfText>
<human> Is he doing better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always worn my dad's wedding ring on my neck as a necklace. <endOfText>
<human> That is sweet and sentimental. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends put together the best party for me! <endOfText>
<human> Was it a birthday party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember eating Cracker Jacks as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I forgot about Cracker Jacks.  I always looked for the prize <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was golfing this weekend, and in the middle of my round it started storming and hailing! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that must have ruined the round! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping to win the lottery this week! <endOfText>
<human> I am hoping as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my friend would be there for me over the weekend. I needed it <endOfText>
<human> sounds like a good friend to have by your side <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really anxious for my upcoming job interview. <endOfText>
<human> Thats understandable! Just be yourself and Im sure you will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm ashamed that I don't have more in my savings then I currently do. <endOfText>
<human> cheer up buddy, everyone have experienced that at one point or the other <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied hard for it, so I know I will definitely pass in flying colors" <endOfText>
<human> For a test? It's good that your confident, that's key! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's good! Any special reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently made a move across states for work, but am having trouble meeting new friends out here. <endOfText>
<human> Making new friends can be tough, is there anyone at work you bond with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend doesn't know how to swim, and she just went in the pool with her life jacket with no care in the world. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing,  Is there a certain reason she cant swim,  she just never learned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once in a dream I was shot, died and everything faded to black <endOfText>
<human> That must've been terrifying in your dream. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I would pass my drivers test. I studied a lot <endOfText>
<human> did you pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one time I realized the milk I bought was expired, I went back to the store to buy more only to realized it was expired too. <endOfText>
<human> Wow sounds like you need a new store..haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lady friend came over and we had some fun...but she left me high and dry :( but I'm pretty optimistic.  She texts me every night asking what I'm doing <endOfText>
<human> Thats good,  Give it some time,  Did everything go good, besides the high and dry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hurt me when my parents got divorced. I never thought that would happen <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry, are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a Korean hot pot place opening up. I won't have to drive an hour away for hot pot anymore, if it's good. <endOfText>
<human> I'll keep my fingers crossed that it's good for you! Is that your favorite food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My care just stopped working right before I was about to go on a big road trip. I can't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> that is such a bomber, will you still be able to go on your trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a group project coming up and team members are totally random. I hope I get good people. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do, too! I have always hated group work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am over the moon about my son graduating from college this year. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, what school did he go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I try to eat dinner, a salesman calls me on the phone. <endOfText>
<human> That is so annoying.  I thought they were not supposed to be allowed to call anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out my childhood dog had to be put down, I'm wrecked. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that.. old age? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was furious yesterday when i saw my dog had gotten out of the gate <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, were you able to track it down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had dinner with my family not too long ago. It's nice seeing everyone together again. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my dog died. He was my friend <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry for your loss. How was was he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious when my friend go a job I wanted. It was not a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> It's not good to be jealous of your friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The site I have a subscription hasnt updated in 1 week with no news as to what's happening. I paid for 2 years. <endOfText>
<human> Gee that's sucks. Have you tried contacting them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a restaurant today for lunch and some lady just takes out her nail clippers and starts cutting her nails. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I guess she really has no care for social constructs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone I am kind of in a relationship with wants to come over this weekend and I am not sure about it. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you hesitant <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling isolated these days.  Still getting over a breakup and most of my friends are raging alcoholics.  But I look at how much money I'm saving by staying in and I feel a lot better! <endOfText>
<human> yes and staying away from addicts is always good as well! Pick a different hobby for sure that's healthy is good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends put together the best party for me. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's no better feeling than the peace I get sitting outside with a good book and the sounds of the rain. <endOfText>
<human> It is good to find some time for ourself to rest. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During a work meeting, I was presenting and two coworker keep talking to each other. It was bothering me. <endOfText>
<human> That's really rude of them, I guess no one taught them manners. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy for my dad. He got to retire <endOfText>
<human> That's very sweet to even reach that age and to retire! I hope he gets to do fun things now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's been a long week already and it's only Tuesday! <endOfText>
<human> It has been long <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish people would be more responsible and would take more pride in their work <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I put a lot of effort into my work and I hate when things are half done. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hope I get accepted into grad school. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats super exciting.  I hope you do too.  What would you go for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my card got declined at lunch,  I was amazed that the woman behind me offered to pay. <endOfText>
<human> That's very nice of her, not too many left that would offer to do that for a stranger. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad I didn't get the job I really wanted and prepared for. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  im sorry, I have been there before too many times.  Just know everything happens for a reason  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no!  im sorry, I have been there before too many times.  Just know everything happens for a reason <endOfText>
<human> That's what I keep reminding myself as I apply for more jobs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The only reason I have this house is because my parents bought it when it was affordable. <endOfText>
<human> Well thats not good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when I tripped in public. It was not a good look <endOfText>
<human> Must've been embarassing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family came all the way from Australia, and I don't really have time to show them around. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not sure about payday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you take out a payday loan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my brother would me this week. He gave me his word <endOfText>
<human> What did your brother do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom baked me a a cake out of nowhere. Lady doesn't even cook. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's nice. How was the taste? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old car broke down on me recently while I was out, but my roommate came and got me. I was so glad. <endOfText>
<human> Your roommate is awesome. I'm glad you weren't stranded. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There a guy parked right in front of my house the past few hours. He keeps looking towards my house, I'm getting kind of freaked out. <endOfText>
<human> That's creepy, do you think you're in trouble for something or is it someone random? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It seems like someone random. I have a bad feeling about it. I think i'm going to call the police. <endOfText>
<human> I would do so just as a precaution, can never be too careful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm annoyed with all the political talk and drama! I know everyone has an opinion, I just don't need to hear it. <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way! I mean, my Facebook feed is full of all this garbage. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a meeting with my boss for my yearly evaluation tomorrow morning, yikes! <endOfText>
<human> you must be nervous, but im sure you will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I brought lunch to work as usual, and it seems everyone went out to lunch this time around <endOfText>
<human> Dang! I hate when that happens.  It's always the day you don't expect it to happen, it happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm prepared for this upcoming winter this year. Bought all the supplies in case of an emergency. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I should do that, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my grand dad died. It was random <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm so very sorry! I know it's very hard to lose a loved one, I lost my sister, father, and both sets of grandparents. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to see that i got approved for my vacation next week <endOfText>
<human> Nice where are you headed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm usually rushing to the store for a protein shake after a good pump at the gym, so I don't miss the infamous "anabolic window"...but these days I come with a premade drink and get to take my time still getting all them gains bruh <endOfText>
<human> wow sound serious. you do this everyday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like the new BMW, it blew away my expectations. <endOfText>
<human> I would love that car <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy when my brother got us game tickets. It was going to be fun <endOfText>
<human> What game will you be going to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even though it is hard...I have been very committed to someone even when they do not deserve it <endOfText>
<human> Not a lot of people are loyal. Who is this someone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend didn't like the price of wedding cakes, so she just made her own <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awesome! I feel my skin jump a bit when I see how much people spend on one day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My almost 16 year old daughter wants to get her ear cartilage pierced. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend went against his parents wishes and didnt have a big 10k wedding. <endOfText>
<human> How did they feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love being able to collect toys for kids who might not get them on Christmas. <endOfText>
<human> That is such a noble thing to do.  Do you work with an organization or on your own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son wiped himself for the first time today! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's great! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been with my wife for 30 years. I don't know how I got so lucky. <endOfText>
<human> That is very lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my dad would help me with my test. He was good with math <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome that your dad helped you out with math. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend passed away in a car accident in the 5th grade. I keep a photo of him around ever since. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad! I'm glad you have something to remember him by. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, we used to do everything together. We used to play a lot of street hockey in the summer times. <endOfText>
<human> He will always live on through spirit in your heart. I'm sorry for the loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm prepared to buy another car soon, mine is on it's last leg. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that's too bad. But exciting at the same time! Do you have a particular car in mind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was excited when i got approved my for my vacation <endOfText>
<human> i would have been as well, going on vacation is really fun. are you going with family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I followed the directions to a tee. I think this kimchi will turn out delicious <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope that it turns out well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was working on a really tough and boring project. When I was done my boss didn't even care. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Sounds like you have a wonderful boss. Sarcasm by the way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah he's a catch. <endOfText>
<human> Is he always this way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor, who I've lived near for eight years, just got a brand new boat. We're alright friends, and we get along well, and I don't usually have any negative feelings towards him. But I can't help but feeling like he's better than me after he's gotten a boat. <endOfText>
<human> Its just a boat <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I know. But since we've lived near each other for a long time and have had similar lives, I can't help comparing myself to him. <endOfText>
<human> I can get that sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous driving this evening. The traffic was so bad <endOfText>
<human> Seems like a silly thing to be nervous about, unless you're a terrible driver. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I had a meeting with my boss today and it went pretty well <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing. What was the meeting about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom painted my room, because she says she wanted to do something for my birthday but couldn't afford much <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of her.  How did it come out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy my brother graduated. He worked hard <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations to him. Is he younger or older? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Fingers crossed that I won't lose my gains from the gym after this 40oz budweiser <endOfText>
<human> You need to induldge every once and awhile, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is moving away, I am going to miss her so much. I can't help but cry a little when I think about it. <endOfText>
<human> Aw sorry to hear that...why is she moving <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was training at the running track today and seen this guys running so fast! It was insane! <endOfText>
<human> oh yea? did you try to keep up with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved takin care of my sisters dog last week <endOfText>
<human> That must have been fun! I love dogs. What kind was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to the store today was a bit hard. <endOfText>
<human> It was? What made it hard specifically? Hopefully nothing too bad happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Girlfriend found a lump in her throat. She has no idea what it could be. Has a doctor's appointment tomorrow. Not sure how forward I am looking to finding out the results, but I guess it's better than leaving it up to my imagination <endOfText>
<human> Very true! Maybe a gioter and she needs more minerals, thats what it is a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel guilty for smoking in the house today when it was raining outside. <endOfText>
<human> Almost all my family members have smoked at one point in time. I feel bad for the people that get caught in the addiction, and I wish I could help them quit. Sorry to hear it's such a hassle enough that you had to do it inside. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave my dog at the vet overnight, so they can run some tests. She hasn't been eating much lately, and she's just been really lackadaisical and lazy. I don't think I'll be able to sleep tonight, knowing she's there in a weird environment, all alone <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I'm sorry to hear that, is she getting up there in age? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still have the food processor my mom gave me, when i went away for college. <endOfText>
<human> Is it working well still <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not sure I wanted to start my new job. I was nervous <endOfText>
<human> How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of people who own those new Tesla's. They are slick! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea, the Teslas look pretty amazing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family cosigned my mortgage loan, because my credit wasn't good enough <endOfText>
<human> That's a very supportive family you have.  I'm right there with you on the credit, mine is not too good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when a check bounced my friend gave me. I knew he was shady <endOfText>
<human> Thats super sketchy of him.  I never accept checks from people.  Only cash. just in case <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my neighbors,  They are so rude.  I hope they move soon <endOfText>
<human> I do not like mine as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got around to making mug cake <endOfText>
<human> How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't get why people feel the need to be Facebook trolls and leave nasty comments? <endOfText>
<human> Pretty much they have problems in their own lives. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went into that interview last week ready for anything they threw at me <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Sounds like you were well prepared for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is coming to visit me this Friday. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats nice. do you all have plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm finally going to get to talk to a girl I contacted onine <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! Do you have a first date planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to swim laps, and I discovered that you can see directly up my shorts if swimming behind me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Must be a sight for those behind you all this time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The food was done on time this week! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome.  it is great when a schedule works out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped off my car at the mechanic and he said it would cost $300.  I picked it up today and the bill was $3000 and he never asked if I wanted to go that high. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I had a car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious when a coworker got a promotion over me. I really wanted it <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Maybe there's a next time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my grandmother's wedding ring. <endOfText>
<human> How did you do that can you remember the last place you had it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How did you do that can you remember the last place you had it? <endOfText>
<human> I have no clue where it is.  I am so hurt about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lightning storms always remind me of you. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my brother canceled on me. He was busy <endOfText>
<human> My brother used to always do that to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I make jello, I think of the jello shots me and my roomie used to make on weekends. <endOfText>
<human> maybe you should try making some again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive to see my friend get a job so quickly last week <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Job hunting can be difficult. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really worried I screwed up at work and said something I shouldn't have. Now I can't stop thinking about it <endOfText>
<human> I bet it will be okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ma hoping my brother comes home this weekend. There is still time <endOfText>
<human> Have you talked to him about it? Why wouldn't he be able? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm anticipating to get a raise at my job this month, I think my boss hinted at it. <endOfText>
<human> Is it a pretty decent raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw someone left my gate open and our dog ran away <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Did you find your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a possum and snake duke it out at our camping trip. <endOfText>
<human> who won <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made kimchi and it turned out pretty bad. <endOfText>
<human> What i that?!?! i think ive heard the name before maybe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> once i left the window open cleaning my birds cage, and she flew away! <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. That's awful. I guess she never came back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This may sound narcissistic and just plain weird...but I'm actually envious of myself 3 years ago, that guy was shredded with an 8-pack and making $2000 a week. I hate his guts lol <endOfText>
<human> I wish i could make that type of money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew i would win the lottory. <endOfText>
<human> Cool congrats I can never win those <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep all of my stuffed animals. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to relax this weekend. I felt content <endOfText>
<human> That is the story of my life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous driving home. It was raining hard <endOfText>
<human> Gotta hate weather like that when you're trying to get somewhere. You ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is a single mom, works full-time and goes to school fulltime. <endOfText>
<human> She seems work hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the one time my girlfriend got really sick , i stayed by her side and did everything for her , cooked for her i just wanted her to feel the best <endOfText>
<human> She's one lucky girl! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The movie starts in 30 minutes, but I'm still stuck at work. I hope I make it in time. <endOfText>
<human> hopefully you do, and remember the movie trailers and commercials take a while before the actual movie plays <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man i'm so scared for the weekend <endOfText>
<human> Why? Whats going on this weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so nervous and I have to wait until friday before this feeling goes away <endOfText>
<human> What is happening Friday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i go to the same place to eat breakfast every morning for the past 10 years <endOfText>
<human> they must be a really good resturaunt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> watching my son graduate was the best feeling ever <endOfText>
<human> i bet! congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not wait till my brother got home last night. We were going out to eat <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up going out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a guy put chocolate syrup on a hot dog. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last time I ordered pizza from my local pizza shop for delivery, they forgot my sauces!! So I called and complained and was ensured that it would not happen again. So this time I put in the order and called to MAKE SURE my sauces came. They should be here any minute now. <endOfText>
<human> I love sauces like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working really hard this entire week. I'm ready for the weekend. I'm going on a camping trip! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting! The hard work will pay off. I've always wanted to camp. Have you done it before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I have! I've planned several trips like this. <endOfText>
<human> Is it just you, or will others be joining you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Entered my dog into obedience training, and he graduated at the top of his class! I think they give all dogs that kind of distinction to make the owners feel better.. but I'm happy we're through it and that he's much better behaved <endOfText>
<human> I've really glad you and your do are getting along well. Dogs are mans best friend after all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ripped my pants at work. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog found a cat in our backyard and has been nursing it. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, normally it is the opposite! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to my big break.  Don't know when it is but I know it'll be in this life because I've been at ground zero and am willing to go through more hell just to reach the decadent, prestigious pinnacle of material success in this lifetime and nothing can stop me <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a goal to me. Good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to get some pizza after work. I love pizza. <endOfText>
<human> I'm eating some pepperoni pizza as I'm typing this.. washing it down with some beer, my kind of Tuesday night <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> was irked when i saw my dog had gotten out <endOfText>
<human> Was the dog okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my team was going to win over the weekend. I had a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> did they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a contest at my job for a free dinner for two! So happy <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! you and me can go eat! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate hte smell of dumpsters <endOfText>
<human> I agree! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After my mom spent hours making dinner for us, I didn't really like it. <endOfText>
<human> Reminds me of when I was younger, but I always acted like I liked it to make her happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hope my parents make it to my home ok, they live 3 hours away. <endOfText>
<human> That's a long drive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious of my friend when he got a new car. I kind of wanted it <endOfText>
<human> What kind of car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother in law to take care of my dog <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to do well at work this morning. I was prepared <endOfText>
<human> That is the way to go! Keep it up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At my birthday cake someone jumped out of my cake <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied all week for this test! <endOfText>
<human> That's some dedication! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to my favorite restaurant, and they're closed for business. <endOfText>
<human> I would have cried for multiple days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad when my cat got out. I should have been more careful <endOfText>
<human> That's no fun. I had a cat that would escape all the time too. Did you get it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an interview tomorrow morning. I think I will definitely get a job offer because of my qualifications. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry when my ac broke today. It was not good timing <endOfText>
<human> That's not cool. Will you get it fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone took my tip at work. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i couldnt leave work on time <endOfText>
<human> i would have been to. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a kid crying by himself in the store today <endOfText>
<human> where were his parents? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was envious of my neighbor. He built a new deck <endOfText>
<human> Aww!  Maybe it's time to start building yours! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really care for my mother <endOfText>
<human> That is a good thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Left my book bag outside overnight. I live in the south where there's lots of palmetto bugs (cockroaches). Went and got it this morning... it was filled with the things! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yuck! Sounds like a disgusting experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bit unexpected but nice: my utility bills were much lower than expected this month. <endOfText>
<human> Right on, glad to hear it. I hate utility bills and how unexpectedly high they can be. I especially hated living with roommates who didn't mind getting them really high, just for the sake of having it a little cooler. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I agree. You never know what it will be each month. I expected it to be higher this month due to the increase in A/C and fan usage, but actually wasn't bad. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it stays that way for you. Luckily I'm in an apartment now where the utilities are included, so I don't have to stress about what it's going to be, or confronting my roommates. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got married and I feel like life is perfect. <endOfText>
<human> Marriage is a very hard thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate an entire pizza <endOfText>
<human> Ohh yeah, that sounds really good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walkin home yesterday <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Why did you feel scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had no idea, but my best friend just told us he was gay last week. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats good that he felt comfortable enough to tell you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes for sure. He said he was afraid to tell anyone all these years. <endOfText>
<human> thats cool that he was able to come out on his own terms <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a BMW. <endOfText>
<human> That's rad, those are slick looking cars! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really care about my community and it's growth. <endOfText>
<human> It is a good thing that you care. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a huge test today,but i was ready! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you prepared well, congratulations! What do you think you got? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty irritated.  My flight has been delayed 7 hours! <endOfText>
<human> oh man! i would also be irate. why the delay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm curious to see which out of these 2 girls I'm texting I'll end up dating first...one 18 and one 24 both super smart and attractive <endOfText>
<human> Date them both? Then pick which one you like the most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother was supposed to help me with my chores. He didn't. <endOfText>
<human> Did you kick him in the shen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my sisters food! <endOfText>
<human> Then what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ready for my drivers test! <endOfText>
<human> Did you do well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared this morning. I woke up with a swollen eye <endOfText>
<human> Did someone punch you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No one even cares about me. <endOfText>
<human> I dont believe that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me remember the old days when I see happy days on tv <endOfText>
<human> There is no such things as happy days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw a huge dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible! Do you know who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no idea... <endOfText>
<human> I hope it's not too expensive to fix! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my friends part last weekend, and someone threw up in the hot tub! <endOfText>
<human> well thats gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah... the worst part was trying to clean up all the pieces. <endOfText>
<human> i can only imagine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was feeling lazy today, and for the most part I had decided I wasn't going to go running, that since i had done it yesterday, I could skip today. Managed to change my mind and exercised anyway. I feel good that I kept up my routine. <endOfText>
<human> That's a real positive spirit! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a storm approaching my house. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully it's not a big one that would cause serious damage, I assume? Otherwise, I kind of like storms. I like the sound of rain, and the visual aspect. It's the best when you get to fall asleep to them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had to send my food back at the restaurant today. <endOfText>
<human> I've never had the guts to do that, even though I've wanted to on multiple occasions. What happened, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Football practice has started for my middle-school aged son, and he's playing a few different positions. He's doing well in all of them, and he has a genuine interest and desire to get better, too. I'm glad I raised someone who could care about something deeply <endOfText>
<human> that is good.i always loved sports as a kid and did well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never played them. Never had the interest or athletic spirit. But I got him into them so he'd have some discipline and structure. <endOfText>
<human> it is a great way to learn that.im glad i was able to learn those values. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its amazing how a picture can bring back so many memories and take you back to a moment in time <endOfText>
<human> I agree....were you just looking through some photos or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm eagerly waiting on a bigger self-employed paycheck by the end of this month.  Whoopeee <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! what do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won the golden ticket! <endOfText>
<human> what is it worth? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i trusted my fried with my dog and i shouldnt have <endOfText>
<human> I do not even have a dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I misunderstood what someone said to me at work today. I thought they said something offensive, and I reacted immediately. It turns out they said a different word. I felt mortified and kept apologizing profusely <endOfText>
<human> I am glad it was resolved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend dumped me today. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful news! I don't want to sound cruel but at least this could maybe be a period of your life where you can just focus on you and improve a lot of areas of your life. You could look at it like a second chance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was very happy buying my first new car today <endOfText>
<human> conrats. what did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other day <endOfText>
<human> why what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when people talk to me! <endOfText>
<human> Now I feel bad about talking to you.  Do you mind talking to me? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother just told me his wife is pregnant. I could not be happier for him. <endOfText>
<human> Is it your baby. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day, I was to tired to mow the lawn. <endOfText>
<human> I feel that way every day almost, Did you ever end up doing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I couldn't resist that glass of whiskey, even though I promised my wife I wouldn't. <endOfText>
<human> Did she find out you broke your promise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend, I went to the swimming pool. I was getting out of the swimming pool when my swim short teared from behind. I felt so bad. <endOfText>
<human> I love swimming! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in awe when my dad won his award <endOfText>
<human> Nice. What was the award for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an argument last week with my wife. She told me that she want to divorce and that I am not the father of our son. I felt destroyed. <endOfText>
<human> Sheesh that's heavy.  Sorry to hear that.  Have you talked it over yet or no <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not alcoholic but I feel like I can vibe better with a chick if I've been drinking.  Because I tend to say stuff I normally wouldn't which makes for better conversation <endOfText>
<human> You are not the only. Nothing to worry about. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We took my neice and nephew to the lake this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a fun weekend! Did you go swimming? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was a beautiful day and I spent it reading in my hammock <endOfText>
<human> Hey that sounds like an awesome day!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey that sounds like an awesome day! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, It felt so refreshing. I needed a day off from work, and it was just perfect. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter's chihuahua mix was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease when she was just a puppy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, poor little thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to bake 10 cakes by tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Oh WOW!  That is a lot of cakes!!  Will you be able to get it all done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lifes good right now got a good paying job , all bills getting payed, not late on anything plus money on the side to go out , i am just overall happy in life right now <endOfText>
<human> Man, I'm jealous! I'm still a college student, barely paying rent! And nothing but student loans to look forward to. I probably should have taken your path in life. Not to say you haven't worked very hard for it, because I'm sure you have. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got hit with a DUI the other night. His wife said that was the last straw, as she was tired of his drinking. She kicked him out and now he's living with me. I feel so terrible for everyone involved, especially because they have two kids <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that, my brother has a drinking problem too, and has kids, i love him but at this point we are more focused on the kids , i tell him if you get locked up who is gonna raise the girls , of course we are but still they need a father  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sorry to hear that, my brother has a drinking problem too, and has kids, i love him but at this point we are more focused on the kids , i tell him if you get locked up who is gonna raise the girls , of course we are but still they need a father <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, and you can never turn your back on family, even if they completely complicate your life.. It's a no-win situation. The kids probably prefer to stay in the original situation, even though it's not healthy and safe, because they just don't understand.. just a big head ache. I'll do what I can, but who knows how much that will be. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> all you can do is stay positive , all we can hope is our brothers will one day wake up before its to late <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. You got a good attitude. I wish for the best for you. Thanks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> I never win and i play all the time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll never stop drinking Dr. Pepper <endOfText>
<human> why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is coming to visit! <endOfText>
<human> awesome.  When are they coming and for how long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car battery is always dead! <endOfText>
<human> UGH thats the worst,  I once ran my car dry of oil..oops. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ill never forget the day that my little puppy died of cancer. <endOfText>
<human> I would have cried for years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going skydiving for the first time this weekend and I have no idea what to expect. <endOfText>
<human> oh awesome.. i couldnt never do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was too trusting when i let my friend watch my dog <endOfText>
<human> Did something bad happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ready to fly to Japan this morning, and when I arrived the airline had given away my seat to someone else! <endOfText>
<human> What?! I would have been livid! Did they compensate you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The love of my life left me for a better man. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hey, I wouldn't say a better man. I'm sure you are just fine for someone else. She didn't deserve you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like sometimes i can be overbearing with my love and it backfires on its intended purpose <endOfText>
<human> Okay, yeah a lot of people seem to have that problem. Maybe you can learn from it for next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy that I have more self-respect than most of my friends who desperately seek approval from women....I focus on my money scheme and end up getting more dates than they do it's hilarious <endOfText>
<human> So, the women only like you because you have money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am baffled on how are of control Trump is right now. <endOfText>
<human> Do you mean "out" of control <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been with my wife for 5 years so far <endOfText>
<human> how is it going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats the way to be! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah back in my younger days I would've been a little more promiscuous but not now!  She's worth it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait till i start my new job <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's awesome!  What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once this super cute girl looked me right in my eyes, and Literally its like i forgot how to function.  It was so embarrassing <endOfText>
<human> It's easy to be intimidated by pretty girls. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is an owl that stares at me in my window. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my,  do you ever geta  weird feeling when it looks at you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I looked up to see a drop of snot falling right towards my face. <endOfText>
<human> oh no what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters bearded dragon <endOfText>
<human> Wow, was it difficult? do they eat alot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a hard weekend! <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? Is everything okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is coming home from work soon. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a good thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I moved to a new town recently, but I don't know anyone here to hang out with yet. <endOfText>
<human> Ah that's difficult. Maybe you can see if there are any sports teams you can join? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was parking my car today and someone just cut in from of me a took my place. How rude can you get? <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, I hate it when that happens. Did you say anything to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know how FB will show you memories from years ago? <endOfText>
<human> no, facebook is the devil! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was impressed when i saw lebron had gone to the lakers <endOfText>
<human> Oh sports...I have no idea about this subject. Lakers is basketball right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a check in the mail today! <endOfText>
<human> Yaya! what are you going to spend it on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister had my makeup on yesterday again! <endOfText>
<human> Aww dangit!  You might have to hide it better lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I see my little dogs face and how much she trusts me, I know I will be there for her no matter what! <endOfText>
<human> I love my little dog too! You are a great owner. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I passed gas in the middle of church. <endOfText>
<human> Well it is natural, maybe bad food choice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My basement got very damaged last year during a storm, so this year I decided to buy a bunch of supplies. <endOfText>
<human> god it repaired ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I wouldn't get too down. Statistically, there's not much of a chance of ever winning. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel positive sometimes today even though not in the best mood. <endOfText>
<human> It's good to always try and think positive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just graduated college. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats on getting him that far! What did he study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when the clock struck 5pm and i got out of work! <endOfText>
<human> Getting out of work is the greatest feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes it is.. <endOfText>
<human> I love to enjoy my free time too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another year, Another disappointed me, no father no nothing. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so sad.  I'm sorry you aren't feeling happy.  What is going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Without my coach, I would be nothing. <endOfText>
<human> I would be too. What kind of couch do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend returned my shoes today. I was so thankful. <endOfText>
<human> I've never had a friend return stuff for me, that sounds like a super caring friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A skunk was in my yard the other night...At first I was scared and froze <endOfText>
<human> Dang, those things are creepy! Did it go away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> all is right in my wold when i eat my favorite meal <endOfText>
<human> What <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The pizza I ordered was going to come in 30 minutes. <endOfText>
<human> did it show up on time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sounded like a big bomb went off the other night by my house. <endOfText>
<human> what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters bearded dragon <endOfText>
<human> I have always wanted one of those! They are very charming. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked in the house and my wife was cheating on her diet with cake in her hand <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sucks! What kind of diet is she on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend returned my wallet yesterday. I was so relieved! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my thats good!  where did you loose it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start classes next week at a new school. <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to eat dinner by myself again. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. That sounds lonely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took out the garbage yesterday and the bag burst on me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That is not good.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished booking a vacation for the fall.  I am pretty happy with how it is turning out <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What book were you reading? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I could be sleeping tonight but got back up because I have dogs barking on both sides of my house, so loud that not even a fan drowns them out <endOfText>
<human> Really? I use fans as well! Most cities have a noise law for after 10..You can call and see? Poor dogs shouldn't be out late anyway <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> woke up a lot last night and felt like I didn't sleep at all. So I was not in the best mood all day and everything was getting on my nerves <endOfText>
<human> I hate that feeling!  Do you have that happen often?  I feel you. I've been losing sleep every night recently.  Are you in front of blue light computer screens or phones a lot?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate that feeling!  Do you have that happen often?  I feel you. I've been losing sleep every night recently.  Are you in front of blue light computer screens or phones a lot? <endOfText>
<human> I am! But I normally sleep pretty good. I am so exhausted by bed time- I woke up a bunch last night to go to the bathroom? So annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That drives me crazy too!  I can't get back to sleep once I wake up to go to the bathroom.  Hope you get some smooth zzzzz's tonight! <endOfText>
<human> I need them, thank you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I wish my mother loved me more,  I feel like my brother got it all. <endOfText>
<human> i understand how you feel , my mom and dad love our older brother a lot and they do not even hide it hes the first born <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my little sister got a job and is still in highs school i know this was  a common thing for anyone back in the days , but in todays world a lot o people are lazy and in titled i felt happy for her <endOfText>
<human> Oh my lord,  Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im doing great , im just really happy for her <endOfText>
<human> Thats good! She is lucky to have your support. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am one of two candidates for a job opening, and I think I got it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, that's amazing! Congratulations, you certainly deserve it :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went into that interviewing knowing the answer to every question they threw at me! <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  I love it when something like that is completely under control. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate went shopping by taking my car. He did not even bother to ask me or let me know. I was very furious <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you! Do you normally let him drive your car? Does he just take it without asking a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School starts tomorrow for my oldest. I really hope he does well and enjoys it and that he doesn't get scared or miss me too bad or misbehave. <endOfText>
<human> Schools are fun. I wish i could turn time back and go back to those good old days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got upset when i saw my brother riding a brand new BMW <endOfText>
<human> hahah did it make you a little jelous you think? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hoped today that I would get a charge reversed from a company that charged me early for a free trial <endOfText>
<human> did it work out or still waiting to hear back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it sucked seeing my brother go to disneyworld for two weeks while im stuck at home working <endOfText>
<human> That would be! However I am not a big fan of theme parks. I do like vacations though! Maybe you can go next year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today! I am super angry at a company for not wanting to refund me after they charged me for a month, early! <endOfText>
<human> that is not good have you tried calling them to talk about the problem <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought a free trial date was Aug 10th, not the 8th so I was charged last night! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sucks. It has happened to me before too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad I don't always get to go through bad things and full get healed. <endOfText>
<human> Do you mean you feel bad that you don't get to go through bad things or that you don't get to be healed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been dieting and exercising, and I'm starting to see the results. It's been a while since I've had this much confidence in how I look. I can't until everyone back home sees me! <endOfText>
<human> What sort of diet are you on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to deal with some truly terrible customer service reps today. They MIGHT own the company but be disguised as support <endOfText>
<human> Yeah i really dont like most call centers they never talk to you in a happy manner they always give me an attitude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super upset with a company I thought was trustworthy. <endOfText>
<human> Why what did they do to betray your trust? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would make a complaint and try contacting the BBB that is so unfair or even get your bank to dispute the charge. <endOfText>
<human> I threatened that, so they refunded. I am still going to blast them on social media though and tell everyone NOT to use them after how rude they are and expecting me to be charged for a whole month of something I haven't/won't use <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was giving a presentation and something really embarrassing happened. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, tell me about it, please! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was diagnosed with epilepsy recently and he had to have an MRI done. <endOfText>
<human> that is not good i am really sorry to hear that, is he o? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movies last night <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice.  What movie did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate causing a scene and being the center of atention.  its the worst <endOfText>
<human> Did something happen to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went shopping today and when I came out to my car I was furious. <endOfText>
<human> uhoh, what happened? did someone hit you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its crazy how sometimes something or someone you havent thought about in a long time can impact you out of no where <endOfText>
<human> Very true. Has this happened to you recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some jerk ran into my car because he crossed a red light <endOfText>
<human> Are you serious are you ok I am getting sick of these careless drivers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching the news and they said we are supposed to get a big storm this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh no im sorry to hear that .  Clear skys here <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my story got nominated in an award.. i am so excited <endOfText>
<human> that is really cool, will you be giving a speech? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its crazy to get news that can make you happy and scared at the same time! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of news did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A co-worker bought breakfast for our department. <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of them! Did you tell them you were thankful? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to a concert really soon and I am very excited. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun, what band is playing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I struggled to use public transport to commute to office. <endOfText>
<human> What was it that gave you problems? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While commuting in public transport I was unable to keep punctuality. But now I'm on time to office since my husband gifted me a motor bike. <endOfText>
<human> That was generous of him.  But continue to work on your punctuality. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of our friends just got a call that her child was not at school. <endOfText>
<human> Did they find out where the kid was at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a big party this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Was it a lot of fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad was in the hospital recently. He was in very bad condition and didn't look like he was gonna pull through. Thankfully he did. <endOfText>
<human> I'm really happy that he made it. I bet it was a tough thing to go through. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of our friends got a call from the school that her 11 year old wasn't at school, and it turned out to be a mistake. Glad, but upset at the false alarm. <endOfText>
<human> Yea that wouldn't of turn out great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Gave my friend a spare key to my house just in case I get locked out or need them to go in for an emergency. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice that you have someone you can trust like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe the slowpoke I got stuck behind in traffic this morning! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that sounds like a pain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so upset and embarrassed that I failed my LSATs and now I can't get into law school. <endOfText>
<human> Can you re-take the test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can but it's only given a few times a year and the next one isn't for another 4 months. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch that's bad.  Study hard. I'm sure youll do better next time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took care of my brother this weekend. He was a little sick <endOfText>
<human> Is he better now ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bumped into some of my old high school friends randomly the other night.  We spent a lot of time talking and catching up <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my dad. This was his favorite time of the year <endOfText>
<human> yea that can be hard when things remind you of people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once skipped out on thanksgiving with my family to go on a road trip with a girl. I didn't answer their phone calls. It was fun, but I didn't like disappointing my family. <endOfText>
<human> At least you had a lot of fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I do well on my work project. I prepared hard <endOfText>
<human> what kind of project was it? It's always satisfying to see hard work pay off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an embarasing moment recently <endOfText>
<human> ill try not to laugh, i promise.  Tell me about it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me happy when you find good people in the world <endOfText>
<human> Did something happen to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been trying to recover from a financial setback for the past few months. <endOfText>
<human> How is it going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  my ex and I are done for good <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. How long have you been together ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ive been doing really well at work lately. I am due for my yearly evaluation and I think I will get that promotion I wanted. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like youre feeling pretty confident. I hope you get the promotion! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a rat running down the power line behind my house. <endOfText>
<human> Yuck. At least it wasnt IN your house. That is gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, i went to native. I visited my place after years <endOfText>
<human> That must have brought back a lot of memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did set a goal of saving a specified amount. I reached it within 3 month after cutting on many leisure related activities. I am proud of myself <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I need to start saving money, myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a dog that got hit by a car. <endOfText>
<human> poor dog , did he survive the impact ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Since i met my friend over a decade ago while working at mcdonalds , he was always been there for him , so i will always be there for him <endOfText>
<human> Is it because you are there for him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad right now that I am actually shaking <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What is wrong?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. What is wrong? <endOfText>
<human> My bank locked me out of my account, so I have no way to get access to my money and I am going on vacation on Friday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My finances will be getting better in the next year. <endOfText>
<human> That has got to feel good!  Did you get a raise or a new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once went to relieve myself in the bathroom of a bar and saw vomit all over almost every surface. If I hadnt immediately run out of there I would have definitely ended up contributing to the mess. <endOfText>
<human> These places should have them clean, because it is inevitably; these things happen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pleased with my youngest daughters progress in learning the piano last night as she played for us. <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud. Im sure she put in a lot of work to learn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got home from yesterday and my girlfriend got me concert tickets for this weekend. I thought it was sold out. I couldnt believe she did that. <endOfText>
<human> What concert is it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The band Phoenix. She really caught me off guard with this. Apparently she bought them a while back but waited until now to tell me. <endOfText>
<human> What a pleasant surprise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old childhood shirt of mine in storage the other day. It was white and red with mickey mouse on it. I remember riding my bikes through the neighborhood with my friends with that shirt on. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great memory! I always get nostalgic about pretty much everything. How long ago was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had a group of friends like that. I always just knew people but never got close. <endOfText>
<human> I went through that too. I'm sort of going through that now. It was much easier for me to make close friends when I was young than it is now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was so content. i sat outside and watched my kids play on their waterslide. <endOfText>
<human> So peaceful and relaxing right? What a beautiful sight.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So peaceful and relaxing right? What a beautiful sight. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I love watching them play and enjoy themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would too if I could sit outside and enjoy it like you! <endOfText>
<human> Yes I get to sit under the tree too and get some shade. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter graduated over the summer, and I felt a sense of accomplishment for her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great. Is she going to  collge? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes she is starting up in a few weeks! :) <endOfText>
<human> What does she want to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish that when people made plans, they would stick to them. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hate people like that.    People that flake out like that just have no respect for anyone elses' time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to mail off a check to pay a bill today and I forgot to put it in the mail when I left for work. <endOfText>
<human> uhoh, I hope they dont have a late fee or anything attached to it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate just moved away. Now I am in a one bedroom but I miss having someone around. <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that , try and keep busy or find a hobby eventually you will get over it, its just gonna take a bit of time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to way 187 lb , i joined jiu jitsu for 3 years before i knew it i learned a lot of skills and ended up weighing 140 i felt good about myself <endOfText>
<human> Whoa. That is a big change. That must make you so happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview a month back for a great job. I went in there extremely nervous, but ended up with the job! <endOfText>
<human> awesome! congratulation.  So you are enjoying the job now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever just feel trapped.  Its so aggravating <endOfText>
<human> I have felt that. It always sucks feeling like you can <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, I have not seen you for a long time <endOfText>
<human> Like ever before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I happened to walk up on a snake in my backyard a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> and what happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A coworker just knocked all the documents on my desk to the floor. It was an accident but they didnt even bother to help pick them up. Very rude I thought. <endOfText>
<human> Wow I would say the same! Accidents happen but come on pick them up. Im sorry!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow I would say the same! Accidents happen but come on pick them up. Im sorry! <endOfText>
<human> He didnt even apologize. Just shrugged his shoulders and kept going. Unreal, some people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I quit my job due to the employer always lying to me, and they didnt even seem to care. <endOfText>
<human> Wow how unappreciative they sound. You will be better off at your next job I am sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it was too bad tho I had expectations of them but obviously they are fake! <endOfText>
<human> Im sure your next employer will be much better. That is no way to treat an employee. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got serious about working out again and I was so nervous and apprehensive my first day in the gym. <endOfText>
<human> I bet.  It can be intimidating to start a new regime. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I went to college I tried to make things work with my high school sweetheart. A few months in I found out she cheated on me and my stomach sank. I never talked to her again after that. <endOfText>
<human> How long ago has this been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's about to rain here. I hope the power doesn't go out. <endOfText>
<human> Does that happen often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I consider myself an animal activist now. I recently went to a protest <endOfText>
<human> Very cool of you to take a stand on something you believe in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend asked me to borrow some money and I let him. <endOfText>
<human> How did that end?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> IDK yet still waiting to see if he actually pays me back. I didnt want to really do it but I did. <endOfText>
<human> Well we give in to our friends. Hopefully he pays you back and not ruin your friendship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How did that end? <endOfText>
<human> IDK yet still waiting to see if he actually pays me back. I didnt want to really do it but I did.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY best friend and I have worked together for ten years. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow thats a long time to work together did yall meet at work? <endOfText>
<human> We did. Now she is leaving and moving away <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats sad. Im so sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<human> That is going to be a big change. I want to quit and move too lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never seem to get lucky in love :( <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ihave ebery thing my kids have ever made me. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome that you have saved all of that.  I bet its heartwarming to look back at all of that stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember graduating high school. It felt like I had my whole future in front of me, so many possibilities to choose from. I sometimes wonder if I made the right decisions. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel. One small decision could make everything nowadays different for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first time I went to a haunted house I was so scared. <endOfText>
<human> Did you see any ghosts? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am staying positive that my blood results will come back okay. <endOfText>
<human> what are you being tested for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My health in general. I havent had a check up in 10 years and have been feeling off. <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope you are okay? Did the doctor hint at anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another one of my neighbors got a new car. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah is it nice?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah is it nice? <endOfText>
<human> Who cares? I want a new car too. I think I am the only one on my block without one now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it sucks when people get what you need and its out of sight but I hope you get one soon! <endOfText>
<human> I do too. I need a raise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are only 4 and 5 now but ther are so smart! <endOfText>
<human> that's great! I bet you are very proud of them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a raffle for a hunting trip. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! When are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am supposed to be moving in with my boyfriend next month. <endOfText>
<human> Congradulations. Is this your first time moving in with a boyfriend?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congradulations. Is this your first time moving in with a boyfriend? <endOfText>
<human> It is, but I keep wondering if it's the right choice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm glad it's raining here today. <endOfText>
<human> I think I would be mad, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned a trip with a friend not too long ago to see the solar eclipse. We were going to go on a road trip. The day before we were supposed to leave he told me she couldn't get off work, and I ended up bored at home. <endOfText>
<human> ah thats sad. You must have look forwarded to the trip <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> last week, my pet dog died. His name is Jack. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry! It's always sad losing a friend.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sorry! It's always sad losing a friend. <endOfText>
<human> Indeed, he was family. It felt terrible like losing a soul!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago i went to mcdonalds for lunch i waited 20 minutes no food, i went up and asked for my food since i only get 20 minutes , they said an error occurred and gave me my food within 20 seconds i was so mad <endOfText>
<human> It has been really dry here, as well.  We are in a severe drought for the third time in four years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally get to go school shopping today! <endOfText>

<human> Congratulations I hope you like it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first time I asked a girl out, it was way back in middle school. My heart was beating out of my chest. She said no, but I learned that rejection isn't the end of the world. <endOfText>
<human> her loss :) i'm glad you didn't get too stressed about therejection <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my favorite movies of all tyme is pans labyrinth by guillermo del toro , but the ending is a bit depressing even for me <endOfText>
<human> I've never seen that movie, why is it depressing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the little girl has a hard life, but in her head she is in a story , at the end she gets killed <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that is very depressing. I hate movies like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of my friends abandoned me and I have no idea why. <endOfText>
<human> now thats more depressing , cheer up you eventually find better friends  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> now thats more depressing , cheer up you eventually find better friends <endOfText>
<human> Maybe but what's the point if they will abandon me too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've gotten a raise that'll start in February. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  Are you going to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was feeling a bit under the weather last night. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Is she feeling better today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up to a loud noise last night. <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to find out what it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone was trying to break in. My heart was racing and I was panicking. <endOfText>
<human> Be safe, they may come back. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend showed up at my new house in a completely different state! <endOfText>
<human> Were you expecting them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not at all! <endOfText>
<human> What a surprise! I love when friends go above and beyond like that, it shows that they really care <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I had a bigger house, I see people with these nice houses and feel envious.' <endOfText>
<human> I know I hear you... maybe one day we will win the lotto.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I hear you... maybe one day we will win the lotto. <endOfText>
<human> We can hope! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a football game the other day and had a blast! <endOfText>
<human> Did you have some good food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a great day and news to go along with that! <endOfText>
<human> What happened today? :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember ordering tattoo machines , then was given the the date of delivery it was going to take 5 weeks that put my anxiety through the roof <endOfText>
<human> Being helpless when waiting for things is the worst feeling. There's nothing you can do but you need to do something! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend's friend died in a car crash a few months ago. She took it really hard. It was terrible seeing her go through that. I stayed with her that whole week. <endOfText>
<human> Your an outstanding mate and great friend, she must have had a hard time my child hood friend died in a car crash and i felt dead inside for a long time <endOfText>

<human> Thats so sad! Im really sorry. :( Have you been researching about it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats so sad! Im really sorry. :( Have you been researching about it? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, they've already gone pretty far. My dad thinks that I'm half my age. My mother only knows who I am about half the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day I will have everything I want out of life, that makes the hard times easier to live now. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, it is good to have something to look forward to.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, it is good to have something to look forward to. <endOfText>
<human> If there isn't, what's the point of life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A situation happened to me earlier this week where my faith was tested. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just received a raise at my one year evaluation. It is so nice to know that they value their employees. It makes me want to continue to do well at work. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear.  Is there any chance of promotion in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to run an errand after work so i'll catch traffic and its going to take me an extra 30mins to get home. <endOfText>
<human> That is annoying. I wish public transportation was better in the city. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was listening to pandora and an old song came on that reminded me of my parents. <endOfText>
<human> What was it ? I'm a music lover. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Johnny B Good! A solid gold oldie! Brought back so many memories. <endOfText>
<human> That is one of the tunes that is on the gold record flying out of our solar system on the Voyager probe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I have been traveling around by myself.  It has been getting to me this week. I miss my friends. <endOfText>
<human> What sorts of places have you been going? Alone time is always great but then sometimes it gets to be too much so I understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No one will watch my Youtube videos and it's frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried sharing it to your friends on social media? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just took my final exam at law school. <endOfText>
<human> How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won first place in a mountian bike race last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! That is so cool! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There would usually be four of us playing per round. The person who came in last had to take two shots. The person who finished third had to take one shot. The person who came in second had to take one shot. The person who won the round didn't have to take a shot. It was a fun game. <endOfText>
<human> That does sound like fun!  What is the came called? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My internet keeps going in and out and it is really bothering me! Why can't it just work like it is supposed to! <endOfText>
<human> Are you on wireless, or a wired network? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im starting my new job in 2 weeks and counting day every last second! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. I bet you cant wait. <endOfText>

<human> Ugh I would be bummed too. Dont give up tho!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh I would be bummed too. Dont give up tho! <endOfText>
<human> It just ruins some summer plans I had. I was supposed to go on a trip but now I wont be able to make it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have big tests in three of my classes this week! <endOfText>
<human> Wow.  Have you studied for them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm dreading the loss of my parents. they are 88 and 85 now and both with dementia. <endOfText>
<human> Just enjoy as much time as you can with them , losing loved ones is never easy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i stated running recently 2 miles a day, the other day i increased it to 3 miles and did not even break a swet i felt really good <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic. How old are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate flying. Something bad is going to happen, I feel it. I don't want to get on this flight. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, why do you think like that.. All should be good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My exam results are up next week. Result is so important for me this time <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you did great, do you have doubts that you didn't? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor is so loud at night. Everynight after 11pm shes out in the parking lot, in and out of her vehicle making noise. <endOfText>
<human> that must be pretty frustrating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is honestly especially when you have to work in the morning <endOfText>
<human> maybe you should have a talk with her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a very nice stranger do something for me today at the grocery store. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? What did they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hurt my foot at work the other day. Kinda ruined my plans. <endOfText>
<human> How did you hurt it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People need to stop letting their dogs poop in my yard! They aren't even respectful enough to clean it up! <endOfText>
<human> that is ridiculous! that's annoying when people don't clean up after their dogs! I love going to the local park with my son and there is dog poop in the grassy areas <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbors had a party last night, so freaking annoying! I could barely sleep. I went to talk to them but they didn't care <endOfText>
<human> You should've called the police if they didn't listen to you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran into an old high school friend while at the store. It was a shock! <endOfText>
<human> Has it been a long time?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yup about 15 years! I also live in a totally different state than the school we went to! <endOfText>
<human> Oh whoa. That is pretty crazy. Hopefully yall can become friends again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Has it been a long time? <endOfText>
<human> Yup about 15 years! I also live in a totally different state than the school we went to!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was at the store the other day, I slipped in front the cute girl that works the register. I feel like such an idiot. <endOfText>
<human> I would have been feeling the same way too. Oh well maybe she thought it was cute.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would have been feeling the same way too. Oh well maybe she thought it was cute. <endOfText>
<human> I dont know if I can go back there again. I looked pretty stupid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Both of my Daughters have performed well in school so far. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, do they enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day my son broke my facorite lamp <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I bet he felt really bad about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> First day of work at a new place <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! How is it going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew they hired me for my skills and talent so I knew I would succeed <endOfText>
<human> That's great, I'm glad you are transitioning to something new so well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor watched my kids at the last minute when I was in a bind, she's awesome. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, how did you repay her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On my 29th birthday my wife invited all my friends without me knowing <endOfText>
<human> a surprise party that is awesome - did you have fun ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The thing the bugs me the most at my job is really lazy workers , they only work when management is around and as soon as they leave back to being lazy <endOfText>
<human> Well thats part of being in the workforce, work when everyone is looking, hang out when they are not. Most people arent paid enough to care <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a bit nervous on my wedding day. <endOfText>
<human> I could imagine. Its a big day you both waited so long for. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last time I visited my parents I passed in front of my old highschool. It was cool to see the old football stadium still there. <endOfText>
<human> Old memories are the best. Do you plan to go back again soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has owned her own business for 3 years. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so impressive! You must be proud.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats so impressive! You must be proud. <endOfText>
<human> I am, I am really impressed with her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fixed my AC all by myself. Pretty impressive if I do say so. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, You saved yourself a ton of money by doing that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For real! I was impressed by what you can find on the internet now a days. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I could not imagine life without the internet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> now that I am married I no longer feel I don't have a companion <endOfText>
<human> im sure that you will find another soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I experienced the grossest thing this weekend <endOfText>
<human> What was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Reading about the Mandela effect always gets me thinking about and missing my childhood for some reason. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean.  Theres some crazy stuff out there about it too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something really gross happened to me last week <endOfText>
<human> What was it that happened to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting lunch today and it will be great! <endOfText>
<human> Where are you getting lunch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week my wife left me. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry that is awful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest daughter had a violin recital a couple of days ago. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that will go in the record books. How old is she?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet that will go in the record books. How old is she? <endOfText>
<human> she's 13 and has been playing for a little over 3 years now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has been so stressed out lately but I have been taking care of her. <endOfText>
<human> What's it all about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything, not able to find a job, we just moved, too much going on. ugh <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like she just needs some time to settle in, and catch her breath. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was accepted into college the other day! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! thats awesome.  Does he know what hes going for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt like I was living in a real live sports movie over the weekend, it was pretty cool <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just the other day it was my sons first birthday! <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet. How did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was such a great day. He came so quickly! Ready to meet the family! <endOfText>
<human> Who are you talking about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle helped me out with $1,000 when moving out of state recently. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome i bet you were very thankful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter won an award at school. 1 out of 1000 kids could win and she won it for art! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! I bet you're really proud of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very proud of her and still cant believe that she won! So amazing. <endOfText>
<human> I really hope that you continue to encourage her! She may have a future as an artist. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied for 1 whole year for the S.A.T. <endOfText>
<human> What was that secret?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What was that secret? <endOfText>
<human> Study everything you can and take practice tests! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma becomes too old and depend on others for her needs. <endOfText>
<human> You need to take care of the elderly, I am sure she has cared for you your whole life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor lets her cats use the bathroom outside in our yard, and of course I stepped in some. <endOfText>
<human> Have you talked to her about this ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah and she doesnt seem to care. <endOfText>
<human> Then use her yard as a garbage can. That's what she does to yours. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to work on my old truck in my garage sometimes. Makes me nostalgic. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it does. What kind of truck is it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure it does. What kind of truck is it? <endOfText>
<human> It's a 1968 chevrolet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, Do you like to go on the hiking trails? <endOfText>
<human> Hey! Yes, I do actually especially when it's nice out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My former roomate left her cat keychain here. We fought a lot, but I kinda miss her now. <endOfText>
<human> Is she far away from you now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something really great happened when I was eating with a friend earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah what was that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah what was that? <endOfText>
<human> When we finished eating my friend gave me a gift as a token of our friendship. It was really sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother promised not to tell my parents my secret, and of course he still did. <endOfText>
<human> That was not very nice of him. Did your parents react well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, and He really shouldnt have told. He promised me. <endOfText>
<human> What a mean thing to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my wife my deepest darkest secret. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I'm taking care of her for the last few months.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I'm taking care of her for the last few months. <endOfText>
<human> Ok good for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma becomes too old and depend on others for her needs. <endOfText>
<human> Could you help her out once in awhile? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled all my coffee on my shirt in front of the cute barista. I dont think I can return. What an idiot. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, you could have played it off as cute and clumsy and maybe they would have been into it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im pretty nervous, and i need some positive thoughts sent my way. <endOfText>
<human> What do you have coming up? Ill keep you in mind. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling really courageous today and did something that I normally wouldn't do. <endOfText>
<human> What was it that you did to feel so courageous??  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What was it that you did to feel so courageous?? <endOfText>
<human> I went up to a girl I liked and asked her out. She said yes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For some reason, when I turned ten I demanded a surprise birthday party from my parents. To trick me, they ended up planning the party for the day after my birthday. I was extremely disappointed on my birthday, but they sure got me the next day! <endOfText>
<human> ha ha ha thats a good one tho! Your parents tho omg. Thats funny but I am sure it wasnt in the moment.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ha ha ha thats a good one tho! Your parents tho omg. Thats funny but I am sure it wasnt in the moment. <endOfText>
<human> It sure upset me at the time, but I appreciate it all the more now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just barely passed my math class. <endOfText>
<human> Are you pretty bad with math? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When the Las Vegas Shooting happened, I was so emotional and sad. <endOfText>
<human> I know it was terrible. Are you from vegas?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it was terrible. Are you from vegas? <endOfText>
<human> I have family there  I hate when stuff like that happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got one of the jobs I have been wanting for years. <endOfText>
<human> That is great I am so happy for you, what industry are you in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do sales work! Not the best but pays the bills! <endOfText>
<human> Thats all that matters, and your happiness  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfather was diagnosed with cancer recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my God, that's terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty broke, I'm not in my home state anymore, I'm unemployed, and I don't feel as though I have a future ahead of me. <endOfText>
<human> Keep your head up and ask around if anyone has oppurtunites for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I answered wrong for the easy question in quiz competition. <endOfText>
<human> That happens sometimes.  How did you end up doing in the end? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really looking forward to the birth of my daughter, but that feeling when I saw her for the first time.  Nothing like it at all. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, It's priceless moment. Being a mother, I can understand your feelings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm glad I left school.  I would've probably ended up taking a job I hated. <endOfText>
<human> What are you doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend stole my car last week <endOfText>
<human> Are you serious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe how fast time flies.  It feels like just yesterday sometimes <endOfText>
<human> YEs it does, take advantage of the time you have now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On my birthday my parents give me a decent sized check <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome. I love getting money as a gift.  Then you get to spend it how you want <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my first child was born. The nurses handed her to me and I remember feeling happier than I ever have been. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome i cant wait to have kids! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone backed into my truck in the parking lot <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you see who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I attend church every sunday. <endOfText>
<human> I'm proud of you! I attend both Sunday and Wednesday nights each week <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a dog, adopted from the shelter. We could see that she was definitely abused. She was so shy at first, but by the end of the month she was all over us! <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to keep her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am finally finished with my work project! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What kind of project is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm the guy who gets mad at his friends for not living up to their full potential. <endOfText>
<human> it is frustrating to watch i agre <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the movies last week, the children would not stop talking. <endOfText>
<human> were they your children? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always been a fan of pets <endOfText>
<human> What kind do you have at the moment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to chain smoke a pack of cigarettes every day. I've since dumped the habit and now workout to destress, because I now have more faith in my body's natural capacities. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, as an added bonus you are saving more money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In high school it felt like everyone had their first kiss before me. <endOfText>
<human> At least you finally got one! Sometimes it helps not to focus too much on what everyone has has or has done. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old hard drive that had a lot of pictures on it went out on me. I'm so upset. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, do you have a digital backup? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my girlfriend in high school. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty messed up. Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found $80 while I was cleaning out my truck. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, what will you spend it on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Right now in my life, I seem to be confused as to what i'm doing and where I should be. I don't feel as though I have a stable base to start from. <endOfText>
<human> There is no "right place" to be for everyone. Each person has their own individual path <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an embarrassing moment last week when I went to work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remembered myself as a kid watching "Fivel Goes West" with my mom and dad when I heard the song "Somewhere Out There" on TV today. <endOfText>
<human> i have never seen it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat just turned 23 last week and has been really sick. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I really sorry to hear that. Is is serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid I put a lot of faith in people.  Now I'm paranoid by default because I hate getting screwed over <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks that that happened to you. Maybe start by putting small amounts of trust in people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished a big project of mine and I am really happy with how it turned out! <endOfText>
<human> Nice what kind of project was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a very cheap dress and i thought it would be low quality but surprisingly it is very well made <endOfText>
<human> That is the best feeling! I love getting a good deal on a great product. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I turned 29 the other day, originally I was kinda feeling bummed out about being in the last year of my 20's. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel! I'm about to be 30 and i feel so old lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> who would and would not be eliminated was the apprehension of the night <endOfText>
<human> What were they being eliminated from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a sporting event, X games actually. I saw a trick that really impressed me. <endOfText>
<human> waht type of game is x game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on vacation to Florida and had a great time. I just felt really happy and relaxed the entire time. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you had a nice trip. Was it your first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter slept in too late this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did she miss school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised at how creative and fleshed out the "Fight Club" characters were on screen...especially after finding out the script was originally a vague short story. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, Fight Club is a great movie! I just recently saw it myself and was really surprised too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am visiting my old hometown on vacation! <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  Where at <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been craving a burrito all day and my sweet boyfriend brought me one after work. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like Mexican style foods? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes especially burritos, but after I took a bite, I found a hair in it and lost my appetite. <endOfText>
<human> Oh did you tell your boyfriend about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking for a new vehicle. <endOfText>
<human> What kind are you looking for? I don't know about you, but I hate car shopping! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got my vacation approved by work. I leave next week. Im getting real antsy though. <endOfText>
<human> Oh where are you going? Is it a long trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I had a great vacation but something went wrong <endOfText>
<human> oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just passed his fist level in swimming lessons. I feel good to be his dad right now. <endOfText>
<human> Did you help him to learn the swim techniques? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, we would practice every even in our pool when the weather is nice. <endOfText>
<human> How old is your son now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thought I'd never squat 300lbs again after my surgery...but I shocked myself with my progress, and now I rep 315lbs ten times on the regular <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's amazing! I workout as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 15 year old cat passed away recently. It hurts really bad. I spent a large amount of my life around that cat. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry for your loss. Cats are such nice companions. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet budgie bird died this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I know how you feel. How old was your bird? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm excited for payday come the end of this month....self-employed paycheck is bigger than the peanuts I used to scrap for in my 9-5 kaching kaaaching <endOfText>
<human> What type of job do you have now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope to get the good news from the doctor today. <endOfText>
<human> And what news would that be <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was kayaking this summing in the ocean and I was followed by a great white shark! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That would be so scary! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am almost done with law school. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, congrats! Do you have a job lined up for when you finish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend learned how to fly a plane in his spare time! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's a pretty cool hobby. Just a small plane? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I seen this guy driving his motorcycle only on his back wheel today. It was crazy <endOfText>
<human> Haha, I've seen plenty do wheelies. I've seen a few crash too, sadly <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a date tonight. I'm pretty nervous <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Don't be too nervous!  Your date is most likely just as nervous as you are! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad just gave me his carbon fiber road bike since he got a new one! I never expected he would give it to me because I know its worth a lot! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah they're great. Super light and rigid.  They feel kind of springy when you ride them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, how's it going? Isn't it tough meeting new people these days? <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely. It doesn't help that I'm pretty introverted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a chance to buy an electric vehicle but ended up opting for one that was conventional. I feel a little bad about the decision. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel bad? It is a tough decision for sure, but you should never have to feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel that for every loss in my life I gain tenfold more blessings.  My life's pretty great these days not gonna lie <endOfText>
<human> Blessing are another reason to be grateful!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Agreed.  When my ex left me I was heartbroken. But now I'm fully self-employed, chasing my dreams, and meeting way more attractive girls <endOfText>
<human> How long were you married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Blessing are another reason to be grateful! <endOfText>
<human> Agreed.  When my ex left me I was heartbroken. But now I'm fully self-employed, chasing my dreams, and meeting way more attractive girls  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day, my daughter decided we needed to take a homeless man a sandwich. I'm so grateful for her kind spirit. <endOfText>
<human> That's really generous of her.  She'll grow up to have pretty good karma  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really generous of her.  She'll grow up to have pretty good karma <endOfText>
<human> I am sure she will. Have you experienced a situation like that before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out my brother in law's wife was cheating on him. And guess who it was with? My friggin' brother! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! That's some Jerry Springer level drama. What happened? Did you tell him/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally peed all over the front of my pants last weekend when I was at a restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that must have been humiliating! Did people notice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got best employee award last month!! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! How did you do it, and where do you work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the first time I ever went to donate blood, after I signed up I instantly regretted it. I was soo worried about that big needle, and when it finally came time? It wasn't even a big deal, it was soo easy. <endOfText>
<human> Everything is harder until we do it. And am proud of you for donating blood. It is one of the good habit of this human race i would say. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, guess what just happened to me? <endOfText>
<human> You met Johnny Dep? I have no idea, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was fired today from my job. I was about to qualify for a good retirement package and they let me go for no reason. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think they just didn't want to pay for your retirement? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend secretly booked a cruise for us next week. She told me today. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's cool...with hers or your credit card..? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm no loner and I love hanging out with my friends.  But for me true Nirvana is when I've got my own space...because I feel that having peace of mind is a gift that most people take for granted. <endOfText>
<human> Sounce like you're a bit of an introvert. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my boss chose my coworker for a promotion instead of me. I felt like I work just as hard as he does, if not harder! <endOfText>
<human> Well that's awful. Did you ask him why he didn't pick you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents just bought me a new car for my birthday! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so happy! What kind of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my sister is pregnant today! She's been trying for years <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's cool.  Glad it worked out for her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a little kid hit a bullseye at a shooting range with a .45 magnum.  He did it 3 times too, it was cool <endOfText>
<human> That's impressive but, 45 mags are rare. are you sure it wasn't a 44 magnum? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I was on a carnival ride and something terrible happened to me! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is graduating early. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats, is your son very old or young? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was walking in the mall and my foot caught the edge of a carpet on the floor, I ended up tripping and busting my nose on the floor! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you get hurt very badly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel sad and kind of guilty when I see old pics of my late Grandma. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. That must be difficult. I am glad you have pictures to hold on to though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a job opening at the law firm that I've always wanted to work at. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! Hope you get it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm amazed at how far I've come in life...from being a loser living at my parents' house not contributing anything to society..to being a self-employed entrepreneur paying my own bills and rent in Texas <endOfText>
<human> that is absolutely amazing! I'm so proud of you! You should be very proud of yourself as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visited an aviation show yesterday and was absolutely amazed by the skill involved! <endOfText>
<human> Was there a big name event going on? I've seen the Blue Angles live  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so aggravated.  I think im going to cancel my cable service <endOfText>
<human> /oh no, what happened, whats the problem with the provider <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a larger than expected bill for my cable this month. so I called them to see what was up and I had to wait on hold for 20 minutes.  After that, the system just hung up on me. <endOfText>
<human> Bad customer service. You should definitely switch <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After long time i played soccer.  Am so bad at it now, i used to be good <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes that happens when you take a break from something for too long, but with some practice you might be able to pick it back up again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to hate it when girls wouldn't text me back.  Now that I'm focused on my job and networking I put little to zero effort in meeting girls...and as a result they're the ones checkin up on me every night lmao <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely! I've always noticed that phenomena. If you act too desperate it actually puts them off. On the contrary, acting a little disinterested gets THEM more interested. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine let me try Korea snacks made with seaweed. I wasn't sure at first, but I ended up loving them! Paint me surprised. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  I'll have to try those out sometime <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved getting to see my best friend unexpectedly, I never get enough time with her. I cherished every minute! <endOfText>
<human> Its always a great time when that happens.  My best friend and I moved away so I hadly ever see them now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever see someone and feel like you are transported back in time to a specific place and moment? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes! Deja Vu has happened to me quite a bit! It's eerie and cool huh? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, some people are just nasty. One time my cousin had an infected toe, and he would not wash his hands after touching it. <endOfText>
<human> He probably passed the infection to his mouth! Gross! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor lets his dog wonder freely around the neighborhood. I honestly wouldn't care much if his dog wouldn't poop on my friggin' lawn all the time. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me so mad!  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love who I am now.  But I'm livid at my older self, that guy was a deadbeat and I'd probably beat the crap out of him haha <endOfText>
<human> Im glad you made changes for the positive in your life.  You cant go back into the past, but you can keep moving forward <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im worried that I am going to get fired at work.  I dont know what to do. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think you'll get fired <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went parachuting and had to pull my secondary parachute due to a malfunction in the first. I was FREAKING out. <endOfText>
<human> That would be so scary! Did it work on the first try? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't imagine. Are you planning on going parachuting again? <endOfText>
<human> I think I will, but it'll be a while before I do! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, you ever do something stupid in front of a whole crowd of people? <endOfText>
<human> More than a couple of times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went out to lunch and no one ever came over to greet let alone seat us, what a waste. <endOfText>
<human> I would never go to that place again. Did you go to a different place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not antagonistic but if someone disrespects me in front of my friends and family or tries to start a fight I'll be ready to knock him out cold or snap his arm <endOfText>
<human> i get you. i hate fighting but i'm not going to be disrespected either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> every week i have a laundry list of things i need to get when i get paid. then pay day comes and it's gone in a second. <endOfText>
<human> Hm I can relate to that haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to a job meeting and a couple of people were late so we had to sit and wait for them! i was so mad <endOfText>
<human> That must have been really annoying. Sucks to be a person who's on time dealing with people who don't care about being on time themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm saving up for a new vehicle so I've been driving around an old ugly green truck in the mean time. It's a bit embarrassing being seen in it. <endOfText>
<human> As long as it takes you from A to B and safe to drive that's all that matters:) I used to have 1995 camry and it looked old and beat up but it was the best car i've had <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can i not be  made at her when my wife wasted all my retirement money <endOfText>
<human> She spend all  youre retirement money? That's pretty messed up.  Why did she do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I will make her pay for what she did to me <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite pocket knife <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hope you can find an alternative <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is aggravating me over not being allowed to be on the computer. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, is she on computer too much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband got a promotion, it's going to be great for our family! <endOfText>
<human> Ooh, awesome! I bet everyone's excited! I hope the future holds many more wonderful things for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you so much, I'm so glad he's worked as hard as he has. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, some people really prove that hard work can pay off. I hope he enjoys the promotion! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's rough getting older. I'm about to be 35 and I've never had a girl friend. I have a couple friends in the same boat as well. <endOfText>
<human> Have you gone on dates before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to take this trip I am on with my friend but they could not make it. I decided to come by myself. Im really missing friends right about now. <endOfText>
<human> I still think you made the right choice by going. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin died in a car crash. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry. That is heartbreaking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was driving down a back road to work and there was a dead skunk <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, did it stink? Was it roadkill? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, I know it's for the best, but I don't know if I'm ready to join the Air Force. <endOfText>
<human> what is making you have second thoughts? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So okay, hear me out. I was at the post officer the other day and I had to wait in line for the ONE pen the post office seems to have. Why only one pen? <endOfText>
<human> As we say around here, you ain't lying! How long were you waiting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is so awesome, she cleaned my house for me while I was away on business. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did you thank your mom or buy her any gifts on your trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some photos of the spring break trip I took when I was 18. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I bet that was nostalgic. How'd it feel seeing your old self doing fun stuff? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new Smash Bros direct came out today, and they revealed 5 characters that people have been wanting for years! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. You must be excited.    Have you played all the smash bros games? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's like a fighting game, but some people call it a "party game", but basically it's a fighting game with all kinds of Nintendo characters. You have stuff like Mario, Donkey Kong, Link, Zelda, Pikachu, etc etc. So every time a new game comes out, people post online about who they want to see in it next. This new game is filled with characters and I think most people will be happy. The first game came out in 1999. Time sure flies. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun I might have to check it out.  It sounds pretty nostalgic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I go to the gym with my girlfriend, she is always looking at the other guys. It makes me feel a bit weird. <endOfText>
<human> I understand where you are coming from. Can you blame her for window shopping though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next Spring Break we will be going on a cruise to Cozumel. We have never been on one before. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. you must be excited.  I've been to cancun but not cozumel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been living alone for the last 5 years. <endOfText>
<human> I would hate to live by myself. I have been married 21 years and have 6 kids and 7 grandkids. I don't know what it's like to be alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I discovered a family of rats living under my balcony. They give me the creeps! <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh! That's terrible. I stayed in a house with a rat problem for a while, it was not fun. What're you going to do about them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever have a dream that feels way too real? The other day I had a dream where I was a kid again and I was with my family and everything was peaceful and happy. <endOfText>
<human> Yes all the time! That sounds like a nice dream. Do you still have a close relationship with your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked up on a snake in my yard a couple of days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh that's terrifying! What kind of snake was it? And what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just love little kids. <endOfText>
<human> I have 3, do you have any <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I clean my house every week and last time I had to clean my toilet, I almost threw up. <endOfText>
<human> That is the worst.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is the worst. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it was bad. My husband needs his gut checked out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got Ford Mustang for my birthday. My father in law presented me that!! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a surprise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is 6 and learning how to use a sewing machine, very cool! <endOfText>
<human> it is indeed, learning things at young age is a boon. you got an exceptional daughter <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my cell phone today <endOfText>
<human> oh no. did you try to retrace your steps to find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at work and when i went out to my car there was a meowing sound <endOfText>
<human> I know where this is going lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my daughter shopping today <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! It's great to spend time with our children. Did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was the best feeling ever watching my son graduate school <endOfText>
<human> I bet it was! I have two kids but they're pretty young. I'm looking forward to seeing them achieve the same thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cooked a delicious looking plate of scrambled eggs with ham on top, but when I melted cheese on top of it all, I hadn't noticed the cheese was bad until it was too late. <endOfText>
<human> oh man, that is the worst! all that hard work, ruined <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily I had a pizza in the oven for my kids. I ended up just stealing a piece of that instead. Either way, so frustrating and disappointing! <endOfText>
<human> i love eggs and cheese and would have been heartbroken. good thing pizza was available <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids still get excited for school. <endOfText>
<human> I bet.  What grades are they in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i orderd a tshirt from my favorite band, limited edition, said it was my size and was completly too small. i cant get a refund at all <endOfText>
<human> That's really frustrating. What band was it a t-shirt for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thinking about my Granddad the other day. I remember this one time where we fished on a lake. It wasn't anything special really, but I still remember it. <endOfText>
<human> i used to go fishing with my grandpa a lot as a kid, brings back awesome memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i took a pregnancy test just to find out it was negative <endOfText>
<human> That's a good feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I log in to facebook every day just for the facebook memories part <endOfText>
<human> That's my favorite part of facebook!  Especially when I see old pics of my kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep. Then there's graduation and prom in may. <endOfText>
<human> And in between football games and soccer games, and christmases - it's a healthy reminder that time flies so quickly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting intensely for a call back for a new job! I figure I have it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is awesome! Im sure you do! Waiting for that can really feel like forever when its only been a few minutes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really scared a few days ago when I went on a trip. <endOfText>
<human> Why's that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have finnaly gotten used to being single <endOfText>
<human> Thats good! Relationships aren't for everyone all the time. You have to love yourself before you can love someone else right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, and you will end up meeting someone when youre not looking and n ot expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> I know. IT will all fall into place when it is time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After my fiances PTO days are over that he likes to use almost two weeks in a row, and things get back to the usual grind, it stinks because I feel so alone in the house trying to control my child. <endOfText>
<human> Thats no good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> cant wait to get the phone call about the new job. i fell very good about it <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Your interview must have went really well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter spent the sumer studying so that she will do well this year <endOfText>
<human> thats good.its very important to instill good learning and study habbits. something i wish i had as kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sounds like she is ready to succeed <endOfText>
<human> Im so excited <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so glad I didn't move into a place that I couldn't afford from the beginning <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear. I am glad you did not overspend and go into debt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling good because I got myself a gift recently. <endOfText>
<human> I love self gifts. what was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am watching the new episode of Castle Rock <endOfText>
<human> Really?Is it a good show? I've never heard of it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really?Is it a good show? I've never heard of it. <endOfText>
<human> I don't like scary show but I can't stop watching it. It is truly frightening <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was walking down the street when a homeless man tried to stop me. He asked me for some money and even though I had plenty money I just ignored him. <endOfText>
<human> I do sometimes too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just feel really bad but I've heard so many stories of people pretending to be homeless just to make a buck <endOfText>
<human> I have seen things like that from people in my own city. It kind of messed up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think our neighborhood school is that great <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, hopefully there is something you can do about that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Uh oh, hopefully there is something you can do about that! <endOfText>
<human> We have to go this year. But I am going to apply to another school for next year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would do the same! I'll pray for you! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got pulled over for speeding last weekend! Man, I sure was thankful that he let me go with just a warning! What a cool cop! <endOfText>
<human> I have never gotten a ticket lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY sis is so bad with money <endOfText>
<human> A lot of people are.  Money sense does not come natural to all people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to have an empty house when the kids go back to school next week. <endOfText>
<human> That is kinda cool though right? Some people, like my mom, could not wait to get us out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when I found out my new job does not have paid lunches, I was hoping they would be <endOfText>
<human> Paid lunches? like a cafeteria? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so afraid to watch any horror films <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? Did you have a bad experience as a kid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I am ready to leave my current job, I have done my research and I could afford to make the leap <endOfText>
<human> You should do it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I will, I hope I can succeed <endOfText>
<human> You can if you believe in yourself. but you will never know unless you try <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You should do it. <endOfText>
<human> I think I will, I hope I can succeed  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of myself for working so much recently, I stepped up and worked long hours each day, and I was not used to doing that <endOfText>
<human> You will be really happy when you get paid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the easiest classes this semester <endOfText>
<human> Did that happen intentionally? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared of the movie the Grudge as a kid, it still scares me to this day <endOfText>
<human> I think I remember that movie <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY new neighbors have been making so much noise moving in <endOfText>
<human> Have you complained? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel young when I play Pokemon Emerald every now and again, that game was my childhood <endOfText>
<human> Dr MArio is that game for me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend just got engaged to her girlfriend of six months <endOfText>
<human> How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have faith in my girlfriend of almost 3 years now, I believe everything she says <endOfText>
<human> i hope she is worthy of that trust <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  was chatting with my dad and the call dropped on us <endOfText>
<human> Did you call him right back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to love taking my kids to the portrait studio. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you not like it anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe the new super smash bros will be very good, the new video today makes it look amazing <endOfText>
<human> I played that a long time ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is turning two soon and it makes me so sad! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no there terrible twos! I wish you the best!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no there terrible twos! I wish you the best! <endOfText>
<human> I think they are beginning to start, but I will enjoy it while it lasts because he will be grown before I know it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went downstairs to pick up our food order last night <endOfText>
<human> How did that go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready to finally leave my job, I have been here for about 3 years with no promotion, I need to get out <endOfText>
<human> You sure do. You sound under appreciated <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a fun weekend planned with my best friend' <endOfText>
<human> That sounds nice, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing. I;m not going <endOfText>
<human> Oh, did something happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stil have my old computer from the 90s in my basement. <endOfText>
<human> Does it run well still? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was made to look bad when I was put on the spot to give a speech in high school, I was unprepared and looked dumb as a result <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am sorry to hear that. Who put you on the spot like that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kept all of my kids firts pair of shoes <endOfText>
<human> I do the same. I kept all of the first outfits for holidays, too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends put together a graduation party for me and I had no idea! <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome. Did you cry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion that I worked so hard to get. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker bought me lunch today out of the blue. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice! Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I went to work on my birthday and my coworkers had gotten me my favorite cake. I was not expecting that at all. <endOfText>
<human> Thats pretty sweet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY daughter never talks to me until I am busy <endOfText>
<human> That sounds about right. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been preparing for grad school and it is making me a little anxious. <endOfText>
<human> I just got in a few months ago, best of luck my friend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is turning two in a couple of months and it is making me a little sad. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that making you sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the newest Mario Party game, it looks like so much fun to me! <endOfText>
<human> I love playing Mario! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get emotional thinking about my brothers, they re really important to me <endOfText>
<human> That's sweet! Family is so important and relationships with siblings is a very significant one in our lives. I felt the same about my sister. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been preparing to take the gre and I cannot wait for it to be over. <endOfText>
<human> What field is that for? I am sure that is a lot of stress <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ashamed of how much I have gone to the gym recently, I have been slacking since I have been working more <endOfText>
<human> Well, you can't do everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm focusing on being more financially wise these days. <endOfText>
<human> That is smart, money is tight these days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am confident in how I perform at work, I wish I was rewarded for it accordingly <endOfText>
<human> Everyone has bad bosses. Just keep working hard and they will have to recognize your greatness. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for my great freinds and family. They gave me a lot of cool presents for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I got a nintendo switch and a bunch of games that wanted for started. <endOfText>
<human> Seriously? Do you like super smash bros? It is coming out in december, I love my switch to death man, it is amazing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somewhat happier today because my bank account was in the negative but I wasn't charged a fee. <endOfText>
<human> I have been there, I hope everything works out for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends put together the best graduation party for me, I was so shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is nice! What happened at the party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when Nintendo announced Ridley for super smash bros, I had been wanting that for years <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that was awesome! I feel like they have a less than stellar track record when it comes to fan service. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went to our local county fair a couple of days ago. <endOfText>
<human> I love the fair! Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am applying to grad school and I am hopeful I will get in. <endOfText>
<human> What is your field ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got some BHB salts that are for keto in the mail today and I am VERY intrigued and couldn't wait to try them! <endOfText>
<human> What are they for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when I found out my job does not pay for you to take a lunch break, that ruined my day <endOfText>
<human> Oh, most jobs don't unfortunately <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so worthless right now.  I think im just going to spend the day in bed tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Well, maybe the time in bed will help you relax <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was kinda a lonely child. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, growing up can be tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having my first son in a couple of months. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. I have two daughters 10 and 13. I wish you the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really shocked when Nintendo announced their Super Smash Bros direct, it turned out to be an awesome one <endOfText>
<human> I haven't heard about the "direct" yet. What about it do you like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get frustrated by my job sometimes, the people who call in just are not competent sometimes <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling.  I do phone support too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hurt a lot when I was passed up for a full time position I wanted at my company <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sometimes a bad parent <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son's second birthday is coming up and it has been thinking of when he was born. <endOfText>
<human> Aw he's still a little guy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our coworker who has been with us for over 20 years just quit out of the blue. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hate to heart that. I hope everything is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I was unfaithful to my wife. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did something happen to have caused it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had tickets to play, but they canceled because the actress got sick <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. What are you planning to do instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son took his first steps a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I must have been so cool to see that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from a long day of work ready to eat this steak I had marinating when I found my roomate had eaten it. I was so upset! <endOfText>
<human> No way, that is the worst. Did you ask your roommate why he or she ate it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All he said was that he thought it was free game even though I had specifically told him it was mine. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready to drop the kids off at school on monday <endOfText>
<human> Is that the first day ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always try to predict the needs of my family too. Like how you're ironing clothes. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good thing. It can sometimes be overwhelming though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so anxious about my son being born in a couple of months, it will be my first child. <endOfText>
<human> You are very fortunate. Have you decided on a name yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends put together a graduation party for me and I had no idea! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids can be little angels <endOfText>
<human> Children are angels! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am impressed with how much content they stuffed into the new super smash bros, they went way too hard for that game <endOfText>
<human> Those games are usually so fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My child is having his first birthday soon. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats, how fast did it go by? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really shocked when my parents threw a party for me for my 21st birthday! <endOfText>
<human> I had to work when I turned 21. That must have been awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY best friend is moving 500 miles away with her family <endOfText>
<human> How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy that the preseason for football starts tomorrow, the Eagles play tomorrow, that is awesome <endOfText>
<human> I enjoy football, but I mainly enjoy that when football happens, fall comes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you seen previews for the meg? <endOfText>
<human> I think so, that's the giant shark movie, right ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish more people understood the concept of personal space. <endOfText>
<human> I know exactly what you mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor bought a new porsche. I envy him so much. <endOfText>
<human> Does he at least work hard for it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting everything ready for grad school is so stressful. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will be glad when it is all over. <endOfText>
<human> You have a lot of hard work ahead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can imagine. <endOfText>
<human> I will be glad when it is all over.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just got a new car <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What kind of car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a nice car! <endOfText>
<human> it is <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends, I was very depressed and alone <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. I am glad you found people to count on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion I work hard for at work. <endOfText>
<human> Me neither, how do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really care for my family, they mean a lot to me <endOfText>
<human> That's really sweet. Is there any member of your family you are particularly close with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love it when it is quiet around the house. <endOfText>
<human> do you like being home alone much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so excited when I held my son for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> I bet. That is a special moment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my daughter go school shopping with her friends <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun, did she have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son will be turning two in a couple of months and it has me looking back. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, are you ready for the "Terrible 2's"? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying to prepare. <endOfText>
<human> He will be into everything. I know what you mean about looking back. Kids grow so fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my pet turtle. I am feeling devastated. I think he escaped the yard. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I am so sorry! I hope you find him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watch my son when I'm not at work, usually for a day or two in a row. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend cooked me dinner for the first time. I did not trust him in my kitchen <endOfText>
<human> Well that's fun!  Did he do a good job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wore the same dress my mother wore at her wedding to my own. <endOfText>
<human> did you like that? i find reusing dresses very combinient <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two daughters keep me happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really proud of a coworker at work. They gave a great presentation. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. What sort of work do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in finace. <endOfText>
<human> Great, how about a loan ? Just kidding. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went to Gulf Shores on vacation for the first time and it was so nice. <endOfText>
<human> wow, it sounds like a very exotic holiday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to accept the fact that my kids are growing up <endOfText>
<human> It's a difficult fact of life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wrecked my car and have no way of fixing it. I need it for my job, my life is ruined. <endOfText>
<human> Can't you just get another one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My teacher saw me cheat on a test <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, you should probably deal with the consequences <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a bit worried because my SATs are coming up and I feel unprepared. I am scared I will mess up bad. <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry too much about it, worrying can actually make you preform worse. You can always retake the test! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am preparing to take my GRE, the graduate school SAT, and I have so much to study. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, then you know how it feels. I hope you do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do, it can definitely be overwhelming. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you won't have anything to worry about. We will both excel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to get so scared by the movie "The Village" as a kid <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I've never seen that movie, but it sounds like it was very horrifying! Have you watched it as an adult? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so mad. I bought a used car for my son and found out later the odometer had been rolled back. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is sleazy, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, I did not know what to do <endOfText>
<human> that is sad i wish you and your family the best of wishes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter hides food under her bed, how nasty! <endOfText>
<human> That is gross, what kind of food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy with my life right now, everything is going okay for the most part <endOfText>
<human> That's great, we all deserve to feel peace and happiness with how our lives are going. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I learned a new trick to putting up a ladder that I wanted to try out at our countywide training the other day. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really pleased with myself! I've worked really hard lately and I was able to pay cash for all new kitchen appliances! <endOfText>
<human> That something which you should be proud of. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been given a very hard project to work on. I am sure that I will succeed even if the other doubt it. <endOfText>
<human> If you were given the project, it's probably because someone thinks you can do it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just got these new sneaker that make him jump higher. He is always dunking on me when we play basketball. <endOfText>
<human> You should get the same sneakers then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As I was walking a dog started running towards me. <endOfText>
<human> Were you scared? Hope it wasn't a mean dog. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my ob interview tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, good luck! Are you nervous for the job interview? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's hurricane season in my area and I've been stocking up on supplies just in case a storm comes! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you're ready to ride out the storm. Are you afraid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math test tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> That is so nerve racking. I'm sure you will do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is starting high school and will be a freshman. Tonight he wanted to go to a get together with a bunch of high schoolers at the park. It is so hard to let him go. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that can be a tough time. Pretty soon he'll be off to college! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new madden finally comes out friday! <endOfText>
<human> Hey, I'm looking forward to it too! Can't wait to crush my co-workers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> word, what system do you play on? <endOfText>
<human> I play on the PS4. It's the only way to play Madden. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to go to the park and read a book today after a tough week of work. <endOfText>
<human> what book you reading? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was playing ball at the gym someone got hurt. <endOfText>
<human> That is too bad. How did they get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a clown walking down my street yesterday. I got so scared because I thought he was after me. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you think he was after you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband shocked me when he bought me a new kitten for my birthday! It is so cute! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, lucky you! What's his or her name?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, lucky you! What's his or her name? <endOfText>
<human> Her name is Smoky!  My husband knows how badly I've been wanting a kitten. It was sweet! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like the feature on snapchat that shows you videos you took a year or two ago. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that feature is pretty nifty. Makes it so you don't have to keep hardcopy photo albums anymore!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, that feature is pretty nifty. Makes it so you don't have to keep hardcopy photo albums anymore! <endOfText>
<human> Oh for sure.  Sometimes it gets me though when it shows me videos of my son when he was just a baby.  Really gives me the feels. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend gave me a box of chocolates the other day. I thought it was so sweet of her. <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice of her!  Was there a special occasion or anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an exam tomorrow, but I'm at work pretty late <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. What type of exam do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oy. I'm on the edge of my seat right now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what's up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finished taking my PA certification exam, and I have to wait weeks to get my results. <endOfText>
<human> The anticipation must be crazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our coworker brought in a cake. It was delicious! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What kind of cake was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went swimming in the lake yesterday all by myself. It was quite lonesome. <endOfText>
<human> Was it planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ordered some pho, and the delivery guy gave me pizza, too. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a lucky day for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's new boyfriend is so good looking, I wish I could get a guy that cute. <endOfText>
<human> aw looks isn't everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked so hard on this project, but my professor said it was horrible but didn't want to fail me <endOfText>
<human> How unprofessional of your professor to say that! What was your project over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should be helping chip in on a friend's birthday, but I only put in $5 <endOfText>
<human> Atleast you gave something it's the thought that counts right. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could give more. <endOfText>
<human> As long as she knows where your intentions are the amount doesn't matter we all wish we can do more but we do what we can don't be down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> An old friend of mine is a medium and told me she connected with my grandfather recently. <endOfText>
<human> That's so cool! What did you think about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my test yesterday. I'm not sure if it was worth it. <endOfText>
<human> How did you cheat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the end of the day when I was small at summer camp I looked like no one would pick me up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dang. Did anyone come eventually? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought about my first kiss on my ride home from work today. <endOfText>
<human> Reminiscing on memories how old was you are ya'll still together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just went to a wedding this weekend, it was very emotional. <endOfText>
<human> They usually are. Who's wedding did you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was my cousin's, it was intense because i grew up with him you know. <endOfText>
<human> Of course! I'm sure he appreciated you being there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was thinking about my leftover Chinese food, came home and someone had eaten it <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when that happens. You should get a lock for the fridge. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned my new neighbor our lawnmower <endOfText>
<human> Well that's nice of you. Did he give you anything in return? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat spit up a hairball into my shoes today. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least he/she feels better now? Sorry about your shoes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I quit a 80k job for a 20k job after paying off the house. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's quite the career leap! What made you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my dog. I wish I would've spent more time with her when she was alive. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I'm sorry. Losing a pet is very hard. I recently lost a cat. It hurts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After going from foster home to foster home, my buddy won a full ride scholarship to our state college <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's incredible! Good for him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sick and need treatment but not sure if I want to go through with it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear about that. What are the risks if you were to go through with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I aced my final math exam today. I was so hyped. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Math is pretty tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Visited my mom last weekend and remember all the times we fought. We fought over such little things <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I am sorry to hear that. Are things better now between the two of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog has been acting flaky recently. I am worried he might be having some health problems. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no :( did you take him to the vet? what kind of dog is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll be giving my first speech in a long time next weekend. <endOfText>
<human> That can be scary! Do you feel prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently underwent surgery and radiation for breast cancer. I'm feeling optimistic because the doctor said everything went well! <endOfText>
<human> I hope it turns out well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I baked a cake for my girlfriend. Never baked before. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! How did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math exam tomorrow. I think I am going to crush it. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Good luck to ya. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a pizza with cheese, eggs, onions and tofu. It sounds crazy, but I think it's wonderful. <endOfText>
<human> That's an interesting combination. Did you make it up off the top of your head? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so jittery over starting my new job tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> New jobs nerves is pretty normal. Get a good rest! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got this $500 phone, and it's already broken. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that sucks. Do you have an insurance policy on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter said her first word yesterday. Never been so proud! <endOfText>
<human> That's adorable! What was the word? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having to be strong and not respond when it comes to a person I care about at times. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it can be tough. Especially if you're in a heated argument. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog took a crap on my new rug yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel! I don't have carpet in my living room for that reason- Sometimes they have accidents. I hate poo accidents especially! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really happy I had enough money to correct a bank mistake today. <endOfText>
<human> Was it yours or the bank's fault? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is fostering 3 cats. She's such a sweetheart. <endOfText>
<human> That's perfection. I rescue animals as well.and have many more cats then that lol. It is very needed to help cats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still have my first gaming PC. It reminds me of my best friend. <endOfText>
<human> How old is it? Did you guys play on it a lot together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really believe my therapist has my best interests at heart. <endOfText>
<human> Did he/she say something you may disagree with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won free grocery! I kinda of wish I would have bought more now, haha. <endOfText>
<human> I didn't know such a thing existed! What store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have not been in the best mood today. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Is something wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got this pizza with 7 toppings and extra cheese. It's heaven. <endOfText>
<human> Was it Domino's pizza? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day I ran to answer the door after the bell rang. <endOfText>
<human> Oh who was there?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to work today and someone parked in my designated spot. Turns out they didn't even work there. I was so p'd off. <endOfText>
<human> That would really annoy me! Did you end up taking any action against them? I know some companies will tow a vehicle that does that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a restaurant tonight and watched this man eat 5 plates of foods from the buffet. It was gross. <endOfText>
<human> What a glutton. Did he happen to have a mountain of crab legs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son, the devious scamp, stole 50 cookies from the cookie jar tonight. Never been so disappointed in him. <endOfText>
<human> 50?  That might be a world record or something.  How did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the show Rugrats, watching that show is one of my most beloved childhood memories. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I loved that show so much when I was little. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt very sad for someone I know who has a mental illness and works so hard sometimes to get better..but then other times they destroy it all. <endOfText>
<human> Mental illness is very tough to deal with it by themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last ramen we had. <endOfText>
<human> Are you in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pulled out a memory box of my kids old crafts the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been very nostalgic <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really was.  I had forgotten so much of it that it was nice to see it again and remember when they were little. <endOfText>
<human> Kids grow up so fast. Gotta cherish every moment sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfirend is recovering from an eating disorder. <endOfText>
<human> That is tough.  How is she doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and a classmate compared scores we got on a test. <endOfText>
<human> How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet alligator bit me today. Never been so irritated in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Pet alligator! Why do you have him as a pet, is he a rescue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pleased with my new dog today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What did your dog do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a co-worker putting the finishing touches on a big project and work, and I am really putting all my faith in him. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What is he working on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My armadillo bit me today. Never felt so irked! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I wonder what that kind of bite feels like. Did it hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been studying for my math exam for the past two weeks. Never felt so ready in my life! <endOfText>
<human> That is good. When do you have the exam? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been stealing internet from my neighbor since two months. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Dang. Why don't you just get your own? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Fall is coming and my family used to have a big festival every year. I wish we still did that. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun. What do you do now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We don't get together anymore. It basically stopped when my Grandpa moved off his farm and passed away later.  It was so fun with pumpkin picking and a huge BBQ. <endOfText>
<human> Oh so sorry to hear that. Well maybe you can round them up for something. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My biggest pet peeve is litterbugs. I want to go up to them and scold them for not respecting the environment. <endOfText>
<human> I completely agree!  I am all about keeping the earth clean, recycling, and low waste living.  They should get bigger fines! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Saw a person who seemed very sick and unhealthy..spit in their hands..sneeze in them..sling it everywhere..then touch the doorhandle to the store <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Does that store have sanitizing wipes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave my friend a makeover. I think her date will be fairly surprised. <endOfText>
<human> Do you normally do makeovers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a bus station and a woman was sitting in the bus station. A homeless person came close and started peeing. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds about right for the bus station, unfortunately. How did everyone react when they saw it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been stealing my neighbor's internet for awhile now. Feel kinda bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, I wouldn't worry about it. There is much worse things you can do. Unless you're doing something you shouldn't be doing online! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends didn't invite me out drinking last weekend. They didn't even bother texting me! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Did you say anything about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog peed on the carpet today. I was so peeved. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is it a young dog or an older one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A co-worker of mine just got the promotion they wanted so badly. I feel really proud. <endOfText>
<human> It's really nice that you feel that way, even though you wanted it. Think you'll get it next time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally paid off my car and my house. Its such a relief and life with my family couldn't be simpler now. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Debt really is an awful thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Applied to another unit and got it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's great.  What unit are you in now and what made you want to change? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is pregnant with her 6th kid <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is pretty amazing IMO..unless she isn't good with kids..My first almost killed me..and I am terrified to do it again.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling uncomfortable in my body today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my math final tomorrow and I am so nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you at least study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was finally able to do a handstand. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. How long did that take you to learn? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let out a nasty burp at work yesterday. Everyone heard it! <endOfText>
<human> Must've been a good burp. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I mistakenly hugged another girl instead of my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. Was she mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got some fast food today and it was sooo good! <endOfText>
<human> I bet.  I love fast food soooo much.  What did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh you know, I need to go vegan as well! So much has wheat in it. Most of the vegan stuff here does. I am in the midwest and I can't have too much fruit..I don't like most veggies and I am on keto :/ SIGH! I am getting there though. You can have fries though unless youre a celiac! <endOfText>
<human> I'm not celiac, but I just eat whole food plant based.  It has been hard for me because I also hate vegetables (not good for a vegan) but I drink a lot of fresh vegetable juices and whole food smoothies to get the nutrients in.  I feel so much better now, though, that I can't go back.  Check out the Happy Pear on youtube, they have great vegan recipes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate so much I broke through my Lap Band. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!! When did this happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite shirt and I wanted to wear it for a concert. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad! Do you know if you can buy a new one before the show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning a surprise party for my brother. I already have all the supplies ready to throw a bash! <endOfText>
<human> I wouldn't be able to keep a surprise like that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting transferred out of the country for my job. I sold my house and all my furniture and am ready to go start a new life. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's quite the shift! Did you have any difficulties leaving things behind you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on my carpet. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> Was the dog upset about something or was he/she just telling you whose boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost her job. I'm glad she paid off her home though <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Maybe she will find a new one soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the carpet. I was so peeved! <endOfText>
<human> Is the dog potty trained? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my friend in 4 years, and she was at my doorstep yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice! Did you guys reconnect? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stand it when my wife hugs other men. I know it doesn't mean anything, but still. <endOfText>
<human> That is really mean. Why does she do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite restaruant closed down, so I'm trying a new one. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate! What style food did your favorite restaurant serve? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My date sure ate a lot for a small girl. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you take her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not happy I didn't get to buy a new car. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Are you saving more? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating lunch today at school and some woman let out the biggest fart I've ever heard. I almost spit my food out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god!! she must have been raised in a barn! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once when I was a kid i hugged this man I thought was my dad and looked up to realize it was a random. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, that's funny you mention that. I seen the same thing happen to a girl when I was at the grocery story one time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my possum yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> You have one as a pet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometime I envy my coworkers because some of them have a better career than me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I sometimes do that as well. But, as long as the bills are getting paid, I guess you can't complain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away yesterday. I am so distraught. <endOfText>
<human> Is the first time that he ran away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a hockey game and bought a ticket on a draw for a new car. <endOfText>
<human> How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat pooped on the carpet the other day. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> That's disgusting! Why are cats so rude? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My school is low income, but we score in the top 5% statewide. <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been out to sea? <endOfText>
<human> I haven't actually. Have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Been studying really hard for my final exam tomorrow. Never felt so ready! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Good luck on your finals! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a new restaurant, and they charge about $5 per dish. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What kind of food do they serve? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They serve authentic mexican food. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds incredibly tasty. I think I will have to go there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a bird in my backyard that had a broken wing. I took it inside to look after it! <endOfText>
<human> That's so kind of you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend cooked for me all week while I was sick, although she had to work and go to school. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's pretty nice of her. I wish my girlfriend would cook for me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends threw me a surprise party yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Was it your birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This 8 year old girl gave a presention about her mom. We all cried. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. What happened to her mom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park the other day. It was so nice relaxing reading a book under the tree. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my that does sound really relaxing. The weather was nice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park all by myself yesterday. It was so lonesome. <endOfText>
<human> That is no fun! I have been feeling lonely lately too, Where are your frineds? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little sister came in crying saying she didnt get accepted to any college! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Does she have any applications outstanding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid has been staying late at school so much lately. <endOfText>
<human> That's kinda sad. Is he studying or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some dude was staring at my girlfriend tonight at dinner. Made me feel some type of way. <endOfText>
<human> I would've been angry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Without the help of my professor I would have failed my first english class! <endOfText>
<human> They sound very helpful and caring! Would you take their classes again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow is payday...I am looking forward too it and NOT in a few ways <endOfText>
<human> Why aren't you looking forward to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is a teacher and took a kid in who was being abused. <endOfText>
<human> She is a saint! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Clocked out of work , and i checked my messages  and my friend said my brothers house just got broken into <endOfText>
<human> Whoa that's terrible. Did the police catch the robber? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They put a warrant out for his arrest , and that is all they can do for right now we are all pretty angry right now <endOfText>
<human> Yes I would be too. I hope you catch them and I hope he didn't loose too much stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner leaves abroad for work for long periods of time. I am always respectful and never do anything that would hurt our relationship. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a strong relationship , im happy to hear people like you still exist in this world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate a granola bar with a bit of chocolate in it. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Was it tasty? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, organic one- I shouldn't have sugar but it's low in it- I feel happy and full- <endOfText>
<human> I love having that feeling. Especially after eating a healthy snack! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start my new job tomorrow and I am so nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord, I bet! Do you start early and what is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. I was so mad at her! <endOfText>
<human> That happened to someone else today too! That is a bummer but is she just a puppy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haven't seen my neighbor in days..he was sitting on his porch almost 24.7 for a week..now no lights and all is quiet. <endOfText>
<human> That's kinda creepy. What do you think happened to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on vacation tomorrow and have everything packed. I've never felt this prepared in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Where ya going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This little girl was dancing at her family's restaurant. She's gonna be a star. <endOfText>
<human> That's really neat. What kind of dance was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted by brother to care for my dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This house is kinda empty without the kids. <endOfText>
<human> where did they go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw someone had put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Your car door? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was stunned by the amount of people getting last minte school supplies. <endOfText>
<human> was it tax free weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Turns out my professor is millionaire. <endOfText>
<human> Wow really? That's interesting. And yet he still teaches?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow really? That's interesting. And yet he still teaches? <endOfText>
<human> Yep. He's one of the more popular teachers, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling very happy at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a 5k marathon last weekend and I won first place! <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awesome. Do you usually run marathons? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad I have enough money saved in case anything happens. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> First grade was great for me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? Why was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some of my work mates earn loads of money despite doing less work <endOfText>
<human> I wish i was one of those people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad that I got a speeding ticket. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How fast were you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an interview for a job way above what I thought I was qualified for <endOfText>
<human> That is great news. How did the interview go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried when I found out my uncle passed away. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow that is horrible, im sorry for your loss <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a test next week <endOfText>
<human> What kind of test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm hoping to find a new job as soon as possible <endOfText>
<human> What was your last job then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got asked if I wanted to go to this party, but it was in a really shady part of town. <endOfText>
<human> Was it with close friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a possibility that we could get snow and ice so I stocked up on supplies. I also gassed up my car. I wanted to be ready just in case. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a good plan. Did the snow and ice come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a show last night and the guy ate a live squid! <endOfText>
<human> There is not enough money to get me to do that. My sister likes those kind of shows and I watch with her sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really let down when my Dad forgot to pick me up from school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's terrible. Was he busy with something else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone scraped my car a couple of days ago, and I'm so angry. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I can not een think about losing any more money! <endOfText>
<human> have you thought  about saving money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have thought about it, but unable to <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it is hard for some people to save money, for me it is kind of hard not to spend what i have <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know that the US will qualify for the next World Cup. <endOfText>
<human> I honestly hope they do not. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pooed in my pants! <endOfText>
<human> Where did this happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A guy once tried to mug me in Amsterdam. <endOfText>
<human> wow that is crazy? did he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> after all these years i tracked down a rare baseball signed by babe ruth, it arrives tomorrow!! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I don't know much about baseball, but I know Babe Ruth. New York Yankees, wasn't he? The house that Ruth built. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Who knew i was 7 foot tall1? <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is really tall. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> The pen is really lovely <endOfText>
<human> What kind of pen are you talking about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked that CNN is still in business. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Aunt sent me a parcel the otehr day - when I opened it it was full of candy and chocolate! <endOfText>
<human> What a lovely aunt. You must be her favorite nephew or niece <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is currently down-sizing going on in the company i work for. I am very anxious as to be the candidate that they will let go <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. It happened to me recently. But, I take the4 view that things like that happen for a good reason and you'll end up in a better position down the line. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the middle of a speech and I farted. I turned red and ran out of the room. <endOfText>
<human> That's so funny! I mean, that must have been embarasing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a briliant pizza yesterday <endOfText>
<human> I love pizza. Did you make it by yourself or with friends? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I received a parcel yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Was it delivered by Fed Ex, UPS or by the US Postal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when someone doesnt take the hint to stop rambling <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I watched a show last night and a guy ate a live squid! <endOfText>
<human> Really? that is crazy <endOfText>

<human> Hm that sounds suspicious. Where do you think it went? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got a nice haircut and shaved my shaggy beard! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Well done. What is the occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss earns way more money than me for less work. <endOfText>
<human> That must be so annoying. You should ask for a pay raise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I see, time to switch companies! <endOfText>
<human> Maybe <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss gets paid loads more than me <endOfText>
<human> I guess thats because he's in a higher position of seniority?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guess thats because he's in a higher position of seniority? <endOfText>

<human> what happend after that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just moved to a new state i dont know anyone and have been pretty down <endOfText>
<human> You must be feeling kinda lonely. Have you tried joining any meetup groups? <endOfText>

<human> That isn't good. Have you spoken to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not like being around large animals, especially bears. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that, it is scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when someone left the gate open and our dog ran away <endOfText>
<human> i would have been pissed too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got home from work today and found someone stole my tv <endOfText>

<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is your dog okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I took a trip down the memory lane when I walked by my old house and street. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that must have taken you back to the good old days? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a rough day at work yesterday but the day ended on a high note when I got home. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i saw a kid by himself crying at the store <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. Did you comfort him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My paper boy never brings my paper on time. <endOfText>
<human> Ah! That must be so frustrating. You should speak to him about this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rented out my house and when I came back it was filthy and smelly <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to call the police and report the renters because I was so disgusted! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I saw a man put honey on his lasagna. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other day <endOfText>
<human> Why were you scared? <endOfText>

<human> That is so cool. You are so lucky to have been able to experience that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother made me a large, fulfilling meal and I ate it all! <endOfText>
<human> Nothing like mom's cooking! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's been thundering and lightning all night! <endOfText>
<human> That must so inconvenient! Are you having trouble falling asleep because of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  was scared to go home alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> Why were you scared to go home alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when a Whopper was 99 cents. <endOfText>
<human> those were the days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Her mum has cancer <endOfText>

<human> Really? That is cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworkers threw me a birthday party. <endOfText>
<human> those are some good coworkers! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite bracelet a few days ago... I have looked everywhere <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I hope you find it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can beat my chest about the outcome of tomorrow's match <endOfText>
<human> You must be quite confident in your abilities!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You must be quite confident in your abilities! <endOfText>
<human> Of course I am after all, I have a reliable team that I can depend on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when i couldnt leave work early <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, did they let everyone else leave early except you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new paper boy flung the newspaper and broke my window today morning <endOfText>
<human> what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I called the police on him because I was so angry. There were glass shards all over my porch. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats good.. dang kid! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend stole 50 dollars from me. <endOfText>
<human> wow that's horrible.. did you confront them> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend recently organized a trip to New York for both of us all by himself. This was really out of character for him because he's usually not organized at all! <endOfText>
<human> Really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girl friend was double dating <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? How'd you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to stop feeding my sister's cat but i can't because it's so adorable <endOfText>
<human> I love cats, they are the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Mcdonald's for dinner earlier. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I came home to find that, my father got me a Mercedes! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's amazing! I'd love it if my parents got me gifts like that!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I was surprised, I did not even expect it! <endOfText>
<human> I could imagine. Maybe I should drop some more hints. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started styudying to be a pilot. I just completed my first flight lesson. I was totally nervous but my instructor was so cool and confident. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is good, its very important to have an instructor like that to calm your nerves. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I really felt like he had my best interests at heart. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well it started off I was unable to check people in. The IT people are very slow at fixing the issue. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, where customers upset with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I was cursed twice and almost had a fight! <endOfText>
<human> Sucks how customers blame employees like it's their fault <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My package got lost in the mail but the company was quick to replace it <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when that happens but that is good they were quick to replace it. <endOfText>
<human> Yes the company had good customer service at least <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was a nervous wreck waiting to see my sons final exam score. i helped him study hard <endOfText>
<human> Oh did he pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't find my car keys since last night <endOfText>
<human> did you look all over for them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lived through a home invasion. Several masked burglars broke into my house and totally ransacked it. I was home at the time. I hide under the bed during the whole ordeal. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, that sounds absolutely terrifying. Do you think they would've hurt you if they found you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is getting remarried this weekend. I'm so excited, it's going to be a wonderful day. <endOfText>
<human> That's a unique experience to go through. Does she have a nice location picked out for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take a test in order to graduate college but I really didn't understand the subject at all and couldn't get anywhere studying on my own. After a lot of agony my sister sat down with me and went over it in detail. She really helped me to learn and understand it. Thanks to her I got a great score on the test! <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice of your sister! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the next season of Game Of Thrones. <endOfText>
<human> I've never actually watched that show myself. But I've heard so many good things about it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a project at work assigned to my team at the last second. It was due in just a few hours! I was the only one on my team who actually cared to get it done. While I was scrambling around the rest of my team just watched me going crazy. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that... it sucks being in a "team" where no one wants to do anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in a great mood, it's almost the weekend! <endOfText>
<human> That's really exciting! Do you have any special plans for this weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to do the dishes the other day, and there were several plates in the sink that were still completely full of food. <endOfText>
<human> do you have roomates? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i came home today with my state jackpot tickets. i didnt win <endOfText>
<human> Aww that had to be a little disappointing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As an adult, buying and living in the house I grew up in means so much to me. <endOfText>
<human> I am so happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember getting ice cream with my family. <endOfText>
<human> As a kid? That's the best! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a package coming in the mail today... i cant wait <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally passed gas in front of my mother in law. <endOfText>
<human> oh no what did she say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a grandson who was born a bit slow. He just graduated high school this year. What was really amazing is that he graduated a year early! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud. That really is a great accomplishment that he has made. Is he going to college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost an earring at work..... Im hoping I find it <endOfText>
<human> was it an expensive one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to write a really long paper for class last week. But I was so busy that I didn't have any time to actually work on it. I ended up copying someone's old paper. I really feel upset at myself for this. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, you can really get in major trouble for doing that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor always interrupts me when I talk. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Do you know why your neighbor does that to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She talks to him on the phone regularly. I have expressed my discontent but she doesnt seem to care <endOfText>
<human> Who does she talk to on the phone regularly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think my partner's been faithful to me lately. So I just took an HIV test. Waiting for the results has me so worried. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine that would be a painful waiting period. Why do you belive she is unfaithful? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an important test to take last week for my certification. I spent so much time studying that I was absolutely sure I was going to ace it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did it not turn out the way you planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't want to go on this Tinder date. Nothing good will come of it. <endOfText>
<human> Don't be so negative about it. Maybe you'll really like the person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a wallet and returned it to the owner. <endOfText>
<human> That's very good of you. I would be proud of myself If I can do such a thing especially if there is a huge chunk of money in it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i broke my expensive favorite pair of glasses. im blind without them <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what are going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a hamburger earlier and they forgot to put cheese on it. <endOfText>
<human> i hate when they forget the cheese <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was nice enough to let me use his car yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice to gave a friend that can help you in time of need. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My doctor made wrong diagnosis multiple times. I can't trust him anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds pretty incompetent to me.  Have you found a new one yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stayed up all night studying and im sure i passed my final <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! It's great to pass your test. Though staying up all night to study may not be the best studying technique. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a weekend trip last week but I forgot to pack any underwear! It was so awkward going around not wearing underwear! <endOfText>
<human> haha that's funny!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> haha that's funny! <endOfText>
<human> lol not at the time for me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> everytime i pass by the old creek, reminds me of my grandpa and us fishing all the time <endOfText>
<human> That must be quite nostalgic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss just bought a new Mercedes. <endOfText>
<human> is it a newer model? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend canceled on me for a concert last minute. Now I have to go alone, it's a bummer, I was looking forward to hanging out with her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. It's really horrible when a friend backs out at the last second. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week when I was out hiking a girl randomly approached me and wanted to make out with me. I had to tell her no because I'm married. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a forward woman. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend told me I'm getting fat. <endOfText>
<human> lol...thats harsh! are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just took my test and i know i did very well!! <endOfText>
<human> That's great you have that kind of confidence. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got the news that my girlfriend's mom passed away. I have to tell her the news myself since she has no other close family. I'm dreading having to actually say it to her. <endOfText>
<human> first of all my condolences for your friend, and i know how hard this is for you both <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a drug addict. I robbed a charity organization last week. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful! Maybe you can pay them back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been sitting at home bored all week so I wanted to spend some time hanging out with friends tomorrow night. But apparently all of my friends are out of town. So I'll still be stuck home alone! <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. I hope you will find something interesting to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a park over the weekend where I used to go when I was little and I was sad to see how dirty it was <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea? why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i deserve that car but i cannot afford it and he can even though I work better job than my neighbour :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a TV show where people were eating cockroachs. I wanted to throw up. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so disgusting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is going to divorce me. <endOfText>
<human> Why she want to divorce? Did she tell you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My interest rate just went up on my credit card. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, did you miss a payment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm always envious of really beautiful girls, I wish I could look that way. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are beautiful too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I helped my brother study for his final exam. He studied really diligiently with me every day. But in the end on the actual exam he managed to fail it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no that isn't good. I"m sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some tests done at the doctors yesterday, hopefully i hear good news <endOfText>
<human> i hope all goes well. was something the matter that made you decide to have the tests done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i lost my job today. was not my fault we got robbed <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I am so sorry! I bet that must have been scary too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward for the new pizza joint to open up here. <endOfText>
<human> I love pizza. What style pizza does the place make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell asleep at work yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Uhoh I hope you didn't get in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son went into the backyard on his own yesterday, pulled his pants down, and proceeded to pee all over the grass. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have total trust in my wife. We are good couple. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, trust is the backbone of all lasting relationships. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a cut on the bottom of my foot and man is it a nuisance trying to walk. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. Did you go to a doctor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoy looking at old pictures and remebering past memories <endOfText>
<human> I do too. It always brings back so many good memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone took my laptop from my car. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Thieves are really crappy people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really looking forward to the upcoming football season. <endOfText>
<human> Oh why is that? Do you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 6 year old son is making very good progress in learning how to swim. <endOfText>
<human> Good for him! That's a very valuable skill to have, good on you for teaching him so early. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Years ago me and my best friend got into a bad argument and I felt terrible later because I realized it was my fault <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know that feeling actually... Did you ever make up with your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to going to the cinema this upcoming weekend. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun, what kind of movie will you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe it is a shark attack movie, so kind of a thriller. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I love those. I have seen a preview for a shark attack movie that is coming out. I think called Meg, I hope to see that sometime <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the Olive Garden for dinner. <endOfText>
<human> I love eating there, the food is always amazing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some one lied to my girl friend <endOfText>
<human> I hope it wasn't a close friend that lied. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't want to keep such friends <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you.  A friend like that isn't a friend at all.  I'm sorry that has happened to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i walked out of the restroom on a blind date and my zipper was dowdn <endOfText>
<human> That's embarrassing, but also funny. How did your date react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm kinda iffy about this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to meet some friends yesterday but they were all busy. <endOfText>
<human> Aww :(  What did you end up doing instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is not feeling well today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, are they going to be okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister got into a bad car accident. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, I hope she is ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man eat an entire birthday cake. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. It is very unsual to see that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, my 4 year prepared a gift for my birthday. It was so cute. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet of your child. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my food that was delvered was deliverd incorrect, but by the time it got here the restraunt was already close. <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying! Did you end up eating it anyway? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a 6 foot sub for my coworkers. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what's the special occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't think anyone remembered, however, I came home to concert tickets that my friend got for me. <endOfText>
<human> Aww was it your birthday or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes.  He got me tickets to Kid Rock concert tonight. <endOfText>
<human> OOO Kid Rock that's one of my friends favorites! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was scheduled to work with me the other day and I was really excited. <endOfText>
<human> I bet, its always nice to get a chance to work with someone you really like.  Where do you work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dentist did an awesome job on my teeth, I love them! <endOfText>
<human> You must be very proud of your new set of teeth <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why do I have to explain to everyone about my preferences? <endOfText>
<human> What preferences do you mean? You shouldn't have to say your truth to anyone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just proposed to my girlfriend and she said yes! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! When is the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, while standing up, my pants teared in the back. I didn't know what to do. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is so sad for you.  How embarrassing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! That is so sad for you.  How embarrassing. <endOfText>
<human> It was embarring. Some coworker were watching me. I had to go to my manager to ask him if I could home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally spilled coffee on my pants yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you manage to avoid a stain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello there! So I just finished high school and retook maths in my final year because I didn't do well it the year before <endOfText>
<human> How did it went? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, two gangs were fighting just in front of my home. It is a very scary situtation. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god that sounds terrible! Are you okay, is everyone in your house okay? Did anyone get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend broke up with me and I understand but I miss him a lot. I liked having him around, he always made me laugh and not feel like I was doing everything on my own. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that happened. Do you still have contact with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During an argument, my wife told that I am not the real father of my son. I am so angry. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible! Do you think it is really true, or she was trying to just make you angry?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is horrible! Do you think it is really true, or she was trying to just make you angry? <endOfText>
<human> I don't know. I am thinking how I can verify that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting for my medical tests to come back. <endOfText>
<human> Are you worried and nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A couple months ago I was on my way home from just buying a brand new truck and got in a wreck. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife want to divorce. I need to prepare myself to not be in very bad financial situation. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Is the feeling mutual? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The start of school is soon, I'm ready to get back to work! <endOfText>
<human> I feel you! Summer is great and all but I miss my classmates and the work I'm studying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We finished out our fiscal year at my job recently and had performance reviews around the end of it. <endOfText>
<human> How did you do ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think okay! I had to meet certain goals tied to my compensation and I thought I would hit them and I did! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, I hope you get a raise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying for a promotion this coming February. <endOfText>
<human> Oh. I hope you get it!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh. I hope you get it! <endOfText>
<human> I think that I will. It would mean a 25% raise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other night <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling old! <endOfText>
<human> are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was my mom's birthday <endOfText>
<human> How fun! How did you all celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Chaperoning a school dance recently reminded me of my own school dances I went to. I always had a great time. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I remember mine as well. They were always a great time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous at first in the spelling bee...but ended up taking first place out of 100 plus kids <endOfText>
<human> WOW!  Congrats!  Was it hard contest? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just back from taking a ride in my boss' new car <endOfText>
<human> Nice! what kind of car is it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a package yesterday and the contents were destroyed! <endOfText>
<human> Oh goodness, that is terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, I saw a coworker pick their nose and eat it. <endOfText>
<human> OMG!  How nasty! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, after having dinner, my partner left her dishes unwashed. It was very disgusting thing for her to do <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that happened. Maybe she was tired from working all day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really looking forward for the new Greek restaurant to open here. <endOfText>
<human> I have never had greek cuisine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY 5 year old acted so mature when I dropped her off for her first day of school <endOfText>
<human> That is great, she will fit right in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been a little nervous lately and I don't know why exactly. <endOfText>
<human> Nervous? That's interesting. Has anything changed recently? What are your thoughts on why it's happening? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was flying to see a relative, and my flight got delayed because of weather! Once I got on it and flew to the next airport, I missed my connection because of the first delay. Now I have to stay in the airport all alone, overnight, sleeping on the ground like a dog. <endOfText>
<human> That was rough, how long ago was this ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend and I had been roommates all through college. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty nice. I'm in college, and I've had three different roommates so far, having to move three different times. Starting to get old. You truly lucked out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gambled away a large chunk of money my grandmother left to me when she died. I thought I could put down most of it and double it, and pay for my college. I thought it was a sure thing, and now I have none of it <endOfText>
<human> That is too bad. What are you going to do? Was this your first time gambling? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sitting on a plane next to an older man, who was telling me about how he had just visited his father, but that it was sad because he has dementia and didn't remember him anymore. I was trying to comfort him, mostly because I worry it will happen to my dad, too. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice that you tried to comfort him.  I'm worried about my parents, also.  It's hard to be worried about something like that in your family, knowing that you have no control over whether or not it will happen.  It's sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend is really getting on my nerves lately. <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend showed me a text this guy sent her that shes been talking to. They were talking about where they live in comparison to eachother. The text said "Yeah, and your fat" and I thought wow how rude! But after that he corrected the auto correct saying he meant to say "Yeah, and your far. He must have felt so bad lol <endOfText>
<human> Omg I was about to say that is so mean and rude and I would be so embarrassed but I know it was a honest mistake I dislike the auto correct.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Omg I was about to say that is so mean and rude and I would be so embarrassed but I know it was a honest mistake I dislike the auto correct. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah he was probably like, "aw shucks another one lost to the stupid auto correct, is good grammar really worth it?" HAHA <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sick of cleaning up after everyone! I cleaned the whole house last week. <endOfText>
<human> I think it's about time you lay down some rules! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm hoping to buy a home this fall.  I recently met with a loan officer about a mortgage.  He was very highly recommended by my realtor, so I thought the meeting would go well.  I was really disappointed when I didn't like the guy and he wasn't helpful at all. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my yeah I would have been pretty irritated!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my yeah I would have been pretty irritated! <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it was a real bummer.  Now I have to search around for someone else to help me get a mortgage.  It's a drag when personal recommendations don't work out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My fiance took a new job about a year ago, and he would eventually get his own work vehicle after the 6 months of training. After that long time of him having the car all day I am happy that his training is over and he gets his work truck and I get the car back! <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Six months is a long time to be car-less.  I'm sure you have a new sense of freedom to do what you want and need to do while he's at work now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty upset at my friend when he ran away from a fight.  I was actually standing up for him against two guys talking crap but he ran away like a little wuss <endOfText>
<human> Well that still makes you a great friend!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well that still makes you a great friend! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks.  Got 6 stitches on my face from a corona bottle when they blindsided me lol...but I still managed to knock out one of them so I was happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The week has been going better. <endOfText>
<human> Have you had trouble lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling ready for Fall to arrive. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? I hate winter though! I don't want that to arrive :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just thinking of my grandmother who passed away 10 years ago. She left me her bible as a reminder. I like reading from it sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice that you have a meaningful item from her.  It's a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's nice that you have a meaningful item from her.  It's a pretty bittersweet feeling thinking about someone you loved who is gone. <endOfText>
<human> Its a great reminder of her. I used to always see her reading from it in the afternoons. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids have been home with me the past couple of weeks (we're doing minimal summer camp), and they've been driving each other crazy this week. Yesterday they argued so many times that I got pretty frustrated and angry.  It was a tough day. <endOfText>
<human> That would take such toll one me. Just make sure they have enough to keep them occupied maybe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it's been rough.  I have a ton of work to do for my day job (working from home mostly this summer), and other stressful things going on, so I'm not doing a great job of keeping them entertained. <endOfText>
<human> Might have to bring them to the park and tire them out. School should starting up soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is a GOOD day, money is okay, paycheck day and there is peace! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! It's always pleasant to have a good day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran out of my favorite makeup and can't afford to buy more right now, what a bummer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I hate it when that happens :( Have you looked on places like mercari or ebay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw something near impossible...some Indian monks taking turns dragging forward a Subaru in neutral by their testicles...looked painful but hey it beats calling AAA I guess <endOfText>
<human> I find this context hard to believe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My police force is so corrupt. <endOfText>
<human> Are you a cop yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling very empathetic to someone this week who sometimes I just want to run over! lol <endOfText>
<human> Well that is kind of you. They must really be going through something. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone hit my car in the parking lot at the mall. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god! I would be SO TICKED! Do they have cameras? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> once I fell on a nail, And my leg was cut wide open I could see deep into my leg. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that sounds horrible. I would probably faint. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father passed away. He left me his favorite watch. I like to wear it often to serve as a reminder of how great he was. <endOfText>
<human> Thats amazing,  I am sorry for your loss, But atleast you have a constant reminder of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yesterday i had a deadline for a project at work. I got started really late and didnt think i was going to make it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!, Did you ever end finishing it up in time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did. But i had to rush and really hammer at it. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good, I just finished studying for a final, And I barely finished in time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really was expecting my loan to be approved.  I couldn't believe it when they told me I wasn't approved. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's terrible! Are you going to apply again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked up on a snake in my back yard a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Woow. That is terrifying. Are you alright? Do you live in some rural areas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After shopping at Walmart, upon leaving I saw a homeless man sleeping near the entrance. I was so sad to see the man in that situation <endOfText>
<human> Yes, that always saddens me too. I see them now and then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i refused to compromise my stand in honesty <endOfText>
<human> Good for you.  Being honest is important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a hand written thank you note from a co-worker in another department. <endOfText>
<human> The note is for what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just arrived in a new country after traveling for two months. There arent many people in the new place I am staying. I am starting miss my friends and home. <endOfText>
<human> What country? If you don't mind sharing...I'm in South Texas and loving it :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got to Vietnam. When I was in Thailand I met so many people. Now I just cant stop thinking of home. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you'll meet some cool people if you find a good Pho restaurant! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This cutie I met at the buffet yesterday somehow found me on Facebook...thought she used a receipt at first, but then remembered I paid in cash...wasn't expecting that lol <endOfText>
<human> Wow she must really fancy you. You should ask her how she found you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was working on a house and a whole section of it was infested with roaches. It was the scariest thing I've ever experienced with bugs. I hate them! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so gross! I hate bugs too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is 17 and a high school junior. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, so close to graduation!  What does he want to do after he graduates? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't seem to get my budget under control and it's really harming me. <endOfText>
<human> budget for what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> gave her a task she did not fulfil <endOfText>
<human> What? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a work dinner and I wanted to help open an expensive wine bottle. By mistake, it fell. I felt bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Mistakes happen! I am sure people aren't too upset. I have numb hands so I drop things all the time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a vacuum from a company online on a warehouse deal..and even though it was inspected..the power button didn't work unless you held it IN! <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying. So, does it still work and it's just hard to use, or does it just do nothing in general? Deals are always tricky like that, as sometimes they're too good to be true. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was planning on meeting up with my father for the first time in a few years since we had a falling out. We had a tentative meeting to see each other at the end of the week, but he's already canceled. <endOfText>
<human> That is just sad of a Dad to be that way. Kids need a lot of unconditional love..but parents aren't always perfect and sometimes don't know how to love their kids like they should ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking on the sidewalk and came across a rotted deer corpse <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross!  They should have street cleaners taking care of that.  Poor animal.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh gross!  They should have street cleaners taking care of that.  Poor animal. <endOfText>
<human> I was sick to my stomache when I saw it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son graduated from high school and is starting college for engineering next week. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know why some people waste their talents and life. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I used to be a deadbeat but now my life is dope.  Are you talking about a friend or family member <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'd still take a bullet for my ex and her family. Even though she blocked me on Facebook. Call me a sucker but that girl was my first love and she gave me so much I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for her <endOfText>
<human> Definitely not a sucker! If she helped you a lot and you wouldn't be here without her, then YES! Why did she block you? Were you bad to her? Sounds familiar to what has happened between me and a few...I was there for them but had enough and I have had to cuit them out too- <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im nervous about accepting a job offer I just received. I noticed a couple red flags while I was interviewing. <endOfText>
<human> That's always a weird situation. You're excited about the offer, and you're worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else, or as good. But you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags, if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is going through a tough process of finding a job after graduating. She's hearing a lot of "no's." She's going to an interview later today for a job she really wants, and I'm worried it will be another no. Trying to make sure the evening is nice and comfortable afterwards to ease the pain, if there is any. <endOfText>
<human> That is tough. I would just make sure everything is nice and clean around the house so she can just unwind. Maybe make a nice dinner and do the dishes after. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no the thai place is closed today, where will we eat now? <endOfText>
<human> Anywhere else? lol- You do not have a lot of thai places in town? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy today I can feed my birds and get everything I need and there is no drama. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a fine day to me. Do you have many birds? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet turtle died. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am so sorry- Turtles need a lot of care to thrive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking forward to getting my new vacuum for the SECOND time tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to the first one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really great job interview. I thought it went well and would receive and offer. They called today to say they went with someone else. Im a little upset. <endOfText>
<human> So sorry, you never really can tell with these things can you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really ready for Fall weather. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. I cant take this heat anymore. It is so muggy outside. Its so annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son has prepared so much for his presentation, i believe he's going to do well <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice.  What type of presentation <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy where my life is right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  Any new changes lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my car broke down a few weeks ago and my friend has been giving me rides lately <endOfText>
<human> Can you have it repaired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My heart is broken. My wife has left me. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry. I know that must be a difficult time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's crazy how the big changes in my life I thought were catastrophes ended up being catalysts for a better future.  I'm thankful for all of them. <endOfText>
<human> They really do make you stronger dont they. It may not seem like it right away though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am currently waiting for my grades to be released. I took a final on Monday. Ive been pacing around like crazy waiting to hear what I made. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! Hope you do well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Both of my daughters are musicians. <endOfText>
<human> wow, that's grate. Are you also a musician? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i gave birth to a beautiful princess <endOfText>
<human> That makes you a queen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I came home after a long day of work, and my husband had left work a bit early and cleaned the entire house! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That would be an awesome surprise to come home to! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh you did? What kind of job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is not where I want it to be yet...but I know I'm on the right path because I've got full autonomy of time and I'm living it to the fullest so I know I'm on the right track <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How can you tell you are on the right path? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always been able to trust my wife and daughters. <endOfText>
<human> that is good, i hope nothing went wrong <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> am still expecting a call from the new company i to an interview for. i still believe i will get the job <endOfText>
<human> I hope it works out for you then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm 100% positive in my capabilities that I can make a billion dollars in a year.  It's my time to shine and I'm gonna get it nothing can stop me <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that would be a huge accomplishment if you did it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom got back on her feet very quickly after leaving her abusive boyfriend. I'm amazed my her determination. <endOfText>
<human> That's great.  She sounds like a passionate and independent woman. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are expecting severe weather tonight. <endOfText>
<human> what kind of weather is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was visiting my parents in my old home town. I passed in front the movie theater where I used to work. I remember having so much fun there. <endOfText>
<human> what kind of fun did you remember having there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son is taking his promotional exams i believe so much in him. he has prepared well enough to be the best <endOfText>
<human> He should be fine if he has prepared. I hope he does well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hey... i just found out i didnt get the promotion i thought i was getting <endOfText>
<human> Oh well maybe you'll get your blessings in a different way you didn't expect <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live the life of my dreams.  As a result I've got a lot of haters so I'm always ready to knock out a jealous little punk who tries crossing me at all times <endOfText>
<human> its sad but true, people dont want to see others doing well! got to be ready to protect what is yours!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I have a feeling you're gonna be a winner. <endOfText>
<human> just keep working, learning and trying new things, cant go wrong like that i think! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its sad but true, people dont want to see others doing well! got to be ready to protect what is yours! <endOfText>
<human> Yes I have a feeling you're gonna be a winner.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is in my childhood at the game park <endOfText>
<human> Did you play there a lot as a child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has been sick and I've been taking care of her. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. How long has she been sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not long, but I love her so much. That's what parents do! <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely! I would do anything for my kids too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend got tickets to a sold out concert this weekend for my birthday. I had no idea she did that. She kept a secret. <endOfText>
<human> because she wanted to give you a surprise present <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i regret watching horror movie last night because it kept me awake all through the night with much fear <endOfText>
<human> Horror movies give me so much anxiety. I cant watch them late at night. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my doughter was born I knew she would change my life. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing.  Those moments are wonderful and priceless!  How old is she now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This is the first time I drop my kids off to school and I know it'll be hard but I know the school si really good and the teachers are so wonderful. <endOfText>
<human> It is the start of their learning journey, be excited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other week we were swimming and my one year old almost fell in the pool. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, have you made adjustments to ensure that wont happen again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep thinking about my grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is she ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My lottery ticket hit a bumper prize. <endOfText>
<human> How much is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning driving into work, people were refusing to use their blinker. <endOfText>
<human> The quality of driving is going down and down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A woman that I work with just got promoted and also won a trip for two to New York that was an office contest. Some people get it all. <endOfText>
<human> Did you want to go to New York? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I made a mistake at work last week <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Was it a big one or not that big of a deal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh good.  Well, at least its a big deal to you because that means you're taking things seriously and concerned about your work. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I guess I am. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this party that my best friend was throwing for a mutual friend of ours because she was moving away. I totally accidentally spilled wine on their light colored carpet. I was mortified because so many people were there, if it had just been my friend then I probably wouldnt have been such a big deal to me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did people make you feel bad for the accident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's amazing how much money I saved this month once I really put my mind to it. <endOfText>
<human> Yes all it takes is cutting back on some things you maybe dont need. I know it can be  hard to do though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This week is a big week for me at my job. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think it will be good news or bad news?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should find out if I get a bonus or not. I am hoping its good news! <endOfText>
<human> Very exciting. I hope you get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you think it will be good news or bad news? <endOfText>
<human>  I should find out if I get a bonus or not. I am hoping its good news! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever walked into a room and knew you were the most interesting person there? <endOfText>
<human> I personally have not, You must have though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, the other day my four year old smashed my favorite figurine. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you get angry with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my parents are bringing my husband and I and my kids on a week long trip to Hawaii! <endOfText>
<human> Oh how exciting, to the big island or somewhere else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Losing your family pet after 10 years is one of the hardest things I have had to do <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  I am so sorry.  I have been there and its devastating.  How is everyone doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is trying to get a job at the hospital. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. What does she want to do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid's school put on a play and I was very impressed with the level of production of it. <endOfText>
<human> What role did your child use. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get selected for a leadership training class at work.  I feel so let down by my work! <endOfText>
<human> Is there another class you can apply for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was hit by a car while driving and half of the car was crushed, but he was virtually unscathed! I'm so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's really lucky!  What happened, did someone run a light or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I am remembering a time in college when we did some cool activities! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What kind of activities? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dove into the pool this past weekend and my swimsuit fell off! <endOfText>
<human> uhmnnn! so what then happened after that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever stepped in the horse poo? <endOfText>
<human> I haven't, though I've stepped in other poo.  Is it similar to others? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a presentation at work the other day. So glad I had all my ducks in a row. <endOfText>
<human> Oh good.  I'm glad you were prepared.  How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going back to college at 36 and start next week. <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting! How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a court date to dispute a parking ticket. <endOfText>
<human> I hate parking tickets!  What a rip off.  How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my boss driving a brand new car today. <endOfText>
<human> The company must be doing well then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow I will find out how I have been doing at work. I am really nervous. <endOfText>
<human> Just show them what you have accomplished this past year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have finished my college education! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  What degree did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband left work early the other to come get me after my car broke down. I appreciated it so much! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! That was so nice of him! You're lucky to have him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I have a big business presentation tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Are you fully prepared for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being a child was the best. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think that is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the grocery store and my 3 year old blurted out, "Mommy, why is that lady so round?" I was mortified. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, kids can be terrible about things like that.  They just have no filter.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I proposed to my girlfriend 2 months ago. <endOfText>
<human> So did she accept your proposal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was lots of price at the maths competition,and i  stood by him as he received the awards <endOfText>
<human> How proud of him were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My average in College was a C <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty good.  you know what they say, "C's get degrees"! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the store and took a small bunch of bananas without paying for them.  I feel really bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Have you thought about telling the store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband has been travelling for work for years now and we just found out that he might be able to work from home anywhere in the world. I really want it to work out! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! what will you do with all the extra time together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job for 2 years now.I was invited for an interview by a multinational org. <endOfText>
<human> Those two years must have been tough.  But this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting pretty nervous about this bad storm headed for the city tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Can you go to a shelter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still use all of my mothers cooking pots. She passed away a few years ago. Its a great reminder of her. <endOfText>
<human> That is so wonderful that you have something of hers.  I'm so sorry you lost her.  That is so difficult.  Did she love cooking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes and she was very good at it. I can still see her cooking my favorite dishes when I use them. <endOfText>
<human> You still have her right there with you!  Its wonderful to know that you're keeping her food and memories so alive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone gave my husband and I tickets to a concert and we can't wait to go, but my sister really loves the band we're seeing so I feel bad going too. <endOfText>
<human> Yea that is kind of a weird situation. I am sure she would want you to have a good time though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was tired when I got home from work yesterday so I just sat on the couch for the rest of the evening and watched tv. <endOfText>
<human> Are you glad you watched TV all night or did you wish you'd done something else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found out that my niece may be autistic. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. have they done any tests? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She's currently going to appointments and things. So they'll find out more soon. <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything turns out for the better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we plan to meet at the party just to see my date so unkept and unpresentable <endOfText>
<human> Well that's unfortunate. Do you think the party will be fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going out of town next weekend with my husband and no kids. I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> wow! that's what i call couple day out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got promoted at work and I have only been there for about a year. I am really happy and surprised with what I have achieved. <endOfText>
<human> thats amazing, im happy for you too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine is setting the bar really high by going to get her second masters degree. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! Good luck to her, are you envious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I took $20 from my wifes wallet. <endOfText>
<human> did you inform her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a plant last week for my garden. <endOfText>
<human> What kind is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am always amazed when I see people who poses raw talent <endOfText>
<human> Can you give an example as to someone who amazed you recently <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents gifted me $50,000 to start my own business. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! that was incredibly nice of them.  What kind of business is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my employer is laying me off!  This will destroy my finances!This is the worst news I could get! <endOfText>
<human> How long do you have ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My two daughters are off to a good start with school this year. <endOfText>
<human> That is always good!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like our country is becoming unsafe each day <endOfText>
<human> I don't disagree. Why do you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, these candidate robo-calls are driving me nuts! <endOfText>
<human> How many do you get per day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last Halloween a few kids Egged my house. <endOfText>
<human> Thats super mean of them.  Did you give them bad candy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never win anything but my luck just changed <endOfText>
<human> How did it change? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to a new city last month. <endOfText>
<human> Exciting!  How are you settling in?  It might take a while but you'll start making friends and setting up a community around you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no one around me anymore so its left me a bit depressed <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that.  It is usually very isolating to move, especially if its away from family and friends.  I did that as well and found I had to consistently get out and try to meet people.  It wasn't always a success but after about 2 months, I started to have things to do.  Keep your chin up and go explore your new city! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been ill with an autoimmune disease for years but just changed my diet to plant based and am feeling so great and healing for the first time since trying everything under the sun. <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear. Will you be taking advantage of your life now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on a Spanish test in High school. <endOfText>
<human> did you get caught <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has been at her grandparents' house this week. The house is so quiet and empty. <endOfText>
<human> Do you find some along time good? do you like being alone every once in a while? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep a baseball card of my grandfather in my wallet at all times. <endOfText>
<human> whats that for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i requested A REFUND TO PICK THE NEXT AVAILABLE FLIGHT ,YET IT WAS DECLINED <endOfText>
<human> Could you fight them more for the refund? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that my father cheated on my mother. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  My parents are divorced.  Same reason. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found the ID braclet I wore in the hospital when I was born. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, keep it in a safe place. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Each week I look forward to one day and one day only. <endOfText>
<human> What day is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworkers had a birthday party for me last week. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a surprise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A moment ago I was thinking about my entire Pokemon collection I had as a child <endOfText>
<human> it's a rose plant. I'm waiting for the blossom of the first flower in that plant. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Could you explain? <endOfText>
<human> i bought a plant last week <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never felt more ready for something than I do right now <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  Anything particular you're ready to accomplish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a piano recital the other day and watched all the younger kids play. Then a young man started playing and he played the most complicated piece I've ever heard! Its amazing the talent some people have and amazing how people can write that kind of music too! <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats awesome.  I tried learning the piano once.  I wasnt good.  So i can really appreciate good talent.  Im always impressed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been through a lot of hard times in life, but I know that God will bless me soon. <endOfText>
<human> i bet he will, everything always gets better dont worry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was left at the alter by the bride to be this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that. That must have been awful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a doctor's appointment the other day and they cancelled it an hour before it was scheduled. I hate that! <endOfText>
<human> They should be required to pay you for that.  They would charge you if you tried to cancel that close to the appointment time.  So annoying!  Did they give you a reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was truly a party faithful,had work rigorously for the election my party won <endOfText>
<human> Amazing! I'm so proud of you for your dedication!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Amazing! I'm so proud of you for your dedication! <endOfText>
<human> You can say that again! but the irony of it was that all the appointments i was promised never came through <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm anxious for school to start again, It's my senior year of college! <endOfText>
<human> That's so exciting! It's almost over! But I can understand why it'd make you anxious, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a party with some friends and I could not remember my friend's husband's name to save my life. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, did you try to play it off or did you have to ask your husband? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever get really emotional about people and things youve never met? <endOfText>
<human> I certainly do.  I think it shows you care and have compassion for their situations.  So many people lose that compassion and even practice indifference. How about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started taking my younger kids to an elderly assisted living home to try to brighten people's day. I think its important to show kindness to others and teach my kids that. <endOfText>
<human> Thats really sweet of you and I bet it means the world to those people.  Its great to show kids compassion and being nice to people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my coworkers got the promotion I'd been vying for. I'm trying to be happy for her. <endOfText>
<human> That must be hard having to be happy for someone that has what you wanted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just noticed my neighbor pull in with a brand new camper. That thing is so nice. I wish I could afford one like that... <endOfText>
<human> Campers are awesome, have you tried socialising with him? maybee he can invite you to see it from the inside <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time we get pizza my husband wants to order Hawaiian pizza. But I just can't get down with pineapple on pizza. <endOfText>
<human> I'm right there with you! I hate pineapple on pizza, it doesn't belong! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad that I have to leave to go back to school next week and leave my friends <endOfText>
<human> That is sad, but maybe you'll make new friends at school. Is it your first year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found this toilet paper that I absolutely love and then, Boom, I never found it again. Until yesterday!!! <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! At least you found it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats great! At least you found it <endOfText>
<human> I know it sounds ridiculous but this stuff is amazing and recycled too so its good for the environment.  I did a toilet paper dance in the aisle, I was so happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog almost always goes to bathroom when I leave her in the house and leave. <endOfText>
<human> thats unfortunate, maybe she will learn eventually though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got stuck in the middle of the storm the other night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, were you driving in it, or were you actually outside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone scammed me. <endOfText>
<human> What did they do to scam you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy I get to see some friends when I go back to school next week. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Are you excited about school too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family and I were finally getting to go on vacation for the first time in 5 years, but we had to cancel because we all got horribly sick. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is horrible, what did you guys come down with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so grateful I have a working car to get around and run errands now! <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful!  I know how important that can be!  Our family of 4 only has one car so you need it to work!  What happened to yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not wait until Saturday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What's happening on Saturday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It usually takes me so long to pick out a new book to read, but I really like the one I've started. <endOfText>
<human> What is it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's set in Revolutionary America. It's a good story; I'm really happy I chose it. <endOfText>
<human> The sounds very interesting, I am sure you could find others like it as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran a red light this morning <endOfText>
<human> Did you do it on pourpuse? and if so did you feel bad after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a long grey hair in my sand witch this afternoon when I went out to lunch. <endOfText>
<human> Was it yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been with my car insurance company for 30 years. <endOfText>
<human> They must be a very good insurance company to be able to keep your business for that lnog! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine entered a pie eating contest with no prior experience and won second place! I was so surprised he was able to do so good. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing.  Most of those guys have been training for years for that level of eating.  What kind of pies were they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My radiator broke down in my car that I rely heavily on. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Can you get it fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started this new book about the American Revolution. It's not something I usually read about, so I hope it's good. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, I'm not too familiar with it myself.  Is it pretty interesting so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My computer's motherboard wasn't running properly so I did a little quick fix. I'd really like it to keep running for another month or two until I can afford a new one. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That is always terrible when technology stops working well.  What did you do to fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work with a commercial bank,the place was burgled my criminals ,i was the one on duty that fateful day <endOfText>
<human> im glad you were not harmed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My website that I designed is turning out great. I'm pretty content with my design. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I love to design websites <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started learning last month and I love it as well. <endOfText>
<human> That's neat! I learned in college so I've had time to delve into it quite a bit and it is very fun. You choose great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog went to the bathroom all over my new carpet and now I have to get it cleaned! <endOfText>
<human> That's no good!  Sorry about the rug. is she still a puppy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a lot of good time at disneyland ,never worry about what to eat or drink <endOfText>
<human> Disneyland is awesome, I went there twice as a kid!  What did you have to eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to going on my vacation next week to the Bahamas. <endOfText>
<human> so do you hope to do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife passed away about a year ago, now I have no family in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. How did she die? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just lost her baby at 18 weeks along. We are all grieving and I'm trying to support her in any way I can. Being a mother myself, I feel so depressed and sad for her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that! My sister went through something similar last year and I can tell you that it will help a lot to spend time with her as often as you can. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife went on a business trip for two weeks. At first I thought it'd be awesome to have the house to myself, but I'm starting to miss her now. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's never fun.  My husband used to travel all the time for work and it was so lonely.  I'm glad she won't be gone too long.  I took advantage of the times he was gone to clean and organize and fix things to surprise him when he returned. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty bummed how my cake turned out, I had high hopes for it <endOfText>
<human> Did you do everything right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hardly got any sleep last night and it was no fun at all. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you sleep well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really looking forward to going away this weekend with my boyfriend, but we had to cancel the trip. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, why'd you have to cancel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Work stuff. It's just so disappointing. I was really looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you can plan for another time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone paid off my student loans for me? I'm shocked! <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow! That's amazing! Congrats! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Almost every night, something keeps dumping over my big trash can outdoors. I keep watching for animals but the way its propped up on a board, I don't see how an animal can do it. <endOfText>
<human> I HATE when that happens. In my case it was a dog, I caught him on camera! Maybe you should invest in a security cam? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son knew that he wasn't suppose to bring drinks near my computer, and he didn't listen! Now he spilled water all over my gaming computer and it won't turn on. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That would've made me so mad.  I let my kids use my computer too but always say, no drinks by it and wash your hands.  Kids always seem to forget that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no!  That would've made me so mad.  I let my kids use my computer too but always say, no drinks by it and wash your hands.  Kids always seem to forget that. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not so sure if it's forgetting or just wanting to be contrary, honestly! Maybe I'm just being a little negative because of how mad I am. People do make mistakes, but that computer cost me and arm and leg to build! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to go to Busch Gardens last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Did you not go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I totally forgot my brother's wife name the other night at dinner, I was pretty embarrassed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm really bad about that, too. Did you ask someone or try to play it off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just waited until someone said her name, so I succeeded! <endOfText>
<human> Nice. That's a good way to do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted to take a weekend trip with my husband and my mom offered to watch my daughter. So grateful! <endOfText>
<human> Mom of the year award! That's awesome, where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't really like the thrillers and action movies but equalizer 2 was really great! I just watched it <endOfText>
<human> I haven't seen it yet! How good was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My work team is the best! <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to go home in 30 minutes! <endOfText>
<human> Yay!  I love the end of the work day!  What are you going to do when you get home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned a vacation with a friend who got severely sick right beforehand so I had to go without her. Its been fun so far but quiet and there's no one to have fun with. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks but, i'm glad you're enjoying your self still. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pretty laid back day at my house, got all my errands ran and now I'm just chilling. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, are you going out later? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My last relationship, I never cheated on my partner. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, did they cheat  on you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I paid off my car, it's a momentous occasion! <endOfText>
<human> I look forward to the day where I can say the same! That must feel liberating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family keeps saying I should buy a new vehicle, but I'm just fine with my old 1995 pickup truck! <endOfText>
<human> I wouldn't want another car payment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just loaned a close friend 400 dollars, I trust that'll he'll pay me back next week. <endOfText>
<human> what if he doesn't pay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i met my closest pal of my childhood days\ <endOfText>
<human> That awesome! Did you guys have a good time and catch up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of my friend's new house. For his age, it's really nice! <endOfText>
<human> how old is he or she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked so hard for my forthcoming exams <endOfText>
<human> Good job, you should do well on them if you're prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a performance evaluation at work coming up soon, but I'm not very worried at all. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck, are you pretty confident you're going to do well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so happy to have my son in my life, he has taught me a lot about life in general. <endOfText>
<human> That's so amazing. It's an incredible thing to be a parent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't get my money under control and I am so angry with myself. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a lot of debt?  I'm sure you will figure it out and get back on your feet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big presentation tomorrow at work. I have prepared a lot for it and feel more than ready to hit it out of the park! <endOfText>
<human> well,i wish you sucess <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She jilted me! <endOfText>
<human> Who did?  What happened? Are you OK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when I let my emotions get the best of me.  Even when I have no reason to <endOfText>
<human> Did something specific happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love being able to help my mom out when she isn't feeling well. <endOfText>
<human> Thats really sweet of you to help her out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm feeling mixed emotions about not having children <endOfText>
<human> Are you scared you may want to in the future and it would be too late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will be starting my first year as a teacher next week! I have never felt more ready for a job than I do right now! <endOfText>
<human> my cousin and my aunt are both teachers and they love it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, my friend just reminded me of such a bad childhood memory. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like a wonderful time at any point in life! <endOfText>
<human> what sounds like a wonderful time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad right now! <endOfText>
<human> why are you so mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a work meeting the other day and one of my coworkers was was able to recite from memory a whole lot of legal policy and verbiage. I was floored by how much he had retained from studying! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow yeah that is quite impressive! He should become a lawyer if he isn't one already! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was with my uncle the other day and he wanted to watch a Discovery TV show I wasn't familiar with so I said okay. It was Dirty Jobs. It was so gross, you couldn't pay me enough to do those jobs! <endOfText>
<human> Haha!  I know exactly what you are talking about!  I love that show and yes, it is quite gross!  You must have felt quite disgusted! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont think I can ever go back to that same store after what I witnessed the other day <endOfText>
<human> oh no. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope i can get things worked out and get pregnant by the end of the year <endOfText>
<human> That can be a lot of work.  We are trying to go through that now too, so i know how you are feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He simply accused me of stealing from him,weve been friends for like 10 years now <endOfText>
<human> that is awful, why did he do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once went on a cruise excursion on Jet skis in the bahamas. I was unaware that we were going to go to a part of the area that sharks nest and frequent, and going to be close to so many sharks! The tour guide was helpful and knew what he was doing, but geez I felt like my life was in his hands! <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine that was very scary! I don't know if I would be that brave! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I just feel like I am living all by myself :( <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel that way <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is an ICU nurse who works night shift.  So i am usually home alone <endOfText>
<human> That does sound hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when my brother invited me for lunch. I had not seen him all week <endOfText>
<human> Do you guys not get together as much?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you guys not get together as much? <endOfText>
<human> No, he works a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a dog who always made me feel better after a long day. She was very loving. <endOfText>
<human> Dogs are the best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was visiting my parents over the holiday. One night I decided to drive in front of our old home I grew up in. It still looked the same. It was nice to see it again. <endOfText>
<human> i love driving past old places from my childhood too! they always seem much smaller than i remember <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its storming really badly herer and there were branches blown onto the street when I was driving home. <endOfText>
<human> That doesnt sound very safe.  I hope you dont lose power <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so defeated right now and I need to figure out how to pay my bills <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I know how you feel.  Do you have a day job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old R/C car I had from when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> thats pretty neat.  I think that might be worth a lot of money <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This attractive girl at the bar was trying to get me to go home with her the other night <endOfText>
<human> Well... did you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in traffic just the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh. Those are the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I just moved to a new city and havent really made any friends here yet. Im really missing my friends and family back home. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like your new city? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband recently spent a year studying for the different parts of the CPA exam. <endOfText>
<human> What is the CPA exam? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember this time in high school, I was really bad at Chemistry and the mid term exam determined the majority of our grade for the semester and I studied very hard. It was so hard waiting to get my score to see if it would lift my grade enough to pass the class! I hate uncertainty! <endOfText>
<human> the unknown gives me so much stress <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother is sick <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that, Is he going to the doctor for help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i don't know what's going to happen it gives me so much stress <endOfText>
<human> I completely understand  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel for you and hope you have a way to manage it <endOfText>
<human> i try to make it work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My next door neighbor is currently having a pool installed. I am so envious! I want one very badly since it is so hot here in Florida! <endOfText>
<human> I bet! I would be so jealous, too! Maybe your neighbor will let you come over and swim? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i enjoy the life i have with my husband <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is cool, do you spend a lot of time with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hunt out with a friend over the weekend to make sure they were okay. He was having trouble with his wife <endOfText>
<human> Did everything turn out alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt great when playing outside with my dogs earlier today. We had a lot of fun running around and throwing the ball. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry at the pharmacy today. They were taking their time <endOfText>
<human> That's no fun!  How long did they have you waiting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rented a big Uhaul truck to move to a new house. The truck is huge and I am quite nervous to drive it! <endOfText>
<human> It will be worth it though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was unsure going to the doctor today. It had been awhile <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I don't think anyone likes going. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was walking in to work and i slipped on some black ice <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends father in law just gave him fifty thousand dollars to buy a house.  I never got any luxury like that. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that would be nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I saw a stray dog on the road. I almost had to stop <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that's sad, I hope it found it's owner somehow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous going to the gym today. There were a lot of people there <endOfText>
<human> Try not to be.  Focus on yourself and your goals.  Use their judgmental looks to push you workout to the max! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss can be so bothersome at times. He will give us a bunch of work to do, but want to sit there and talk to us at length while we are trying to concentrate on our tasks! <endOfText>
<human> Bosses are sometimes unaware it seems <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran over a rabbit this morning. I felt bad <endOfText>
<human> i have a pet rabbit. that makes me sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i don't like the feeling of the unknown <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been having a lot of money trouble and just yesterday an anonymous cashiers check came in the mail for $5000! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's super lucky! So you have no idea where it came from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt good getting medicine today. I think it will make me feel better <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear.  Have you been ill for a while.  I hope not. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry today in traffic. It just makes me mad everytime <endOfText>
<human> i used to sit in 2 hours of traffic daily. no longer is that my problem <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the last person i talked to said they killed a rabbit. <endOfText>
<human> I believe that was me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take an ethics course to retain my real estate license today, and I passed the test. It was much easier than I expected. <endOfText>
<human> You sound like you are going to do well then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a picture of my mom today. It made me miss her <endOfText>
<human> Aw, yeah I've been missing my Mom lately as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a friend request on facebook last week from this person that I knew I recognized but couldnt remember exactly where I had met them. After thinking and looking at older photos of the person on their page I realized it was a good friend I met on a cruise some 15 years ago that I enjoyed spending the short time with. I cant believe he remembered my name. <endOfText>
<human> That is so crazy.  I love how Facebook reconnects people from so long ago.  Do you have any plans to meet up some time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had to move out of my house, but I think it is for the best. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bumped into my friends car this morning parking. It was a little shameful for me <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Was it bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I booked a cheap mystery hotel room on Hotels.com and was pretty happy to find out when I got in that it's a 4 star hotel! <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to find good deals <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to relax over the weekend and do some reading. It was nice <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so nice I'm jealous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied really hard for my test last week. <endOfText>
<human> How did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw some pictures of back home from old. It made me miss it <endOfText>
<human> Aww, it's nice to relive those old memories sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I arrived at my hotel that I'm staying in for a work trip. I'm peeved that my room is on the first floor directly next to the pool. Lots of screaming kids all day/night. <endOfText>
<human> Kids can be annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to a friend this weekend. It made me feel like a rat <endOfText>
<human> What did you lie about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for football season, the Eagles are playing their first game in a few minutes! <endOfText>
<human> I am a saints fan, so I am excited too ha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Although I'm not doing very well financially, and I'm not where I want to be right now... At least I have a roof over my head and food to eat. <endOfText>
<human> That is a great attitude to have.  I know it is hard to go through periods of struggle.  Do you have hope that things will get better soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I am a faithful person. I also believe in God, and I'm a Christian. So, I do believe that things will get better for me soon. <endOfText>
<human> That is phenomenal!  In hard times it is easy to distace ourselves from God, but I believe it is important to press in and cast our cares on Him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife's grandmother just moved in with us. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Actually I think that is a good thing. How's is going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope the Eagles are a great team this year, they were awesome last year <endOfText>
<human> They will be good again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an old game on tv today. It made me think of the past <endOfText>
<human> What game was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have faith the Eagles will be good this year, I hope it goes well! <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope they play well for you :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got surprised by winning a trip to disneyland this weekend! I am overjoyed! <endOfText>
<human> Is it all expenses paid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, everything is covered including some money for food! <endOfText>
<human> Well, congrats on winning that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved playing Pokemon as a kid, what a great series, I played for so many hours <endOfText>
<human> My son really liked Pokemon too! He liked playing the card game and watching the show. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting frustrated with my job recently, they are overworking us <endOfText>
<human> What kind of work is it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The rain got me down today. I could not get going <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, hope it gets better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to go on a trip over the weekend, but I didn't go. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month I was running a bit short on cash, but I got a bonus from work out of the blue. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! How lucky! Perfect timing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> Don't be jealous, instead, brush on your studying and start going to the gym. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Although my life isn't going very well right now, at least I have a roof over my head and food to eat. Many people in the world don't even have those two things. <endOfText>
<human> I get that, but things are still better for those around you, so it feels bad still <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked that the Eagles won the superbowl last year, really caught me off guard <endOfText>
<human> I don't follow football much.  Were they not the favored to win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the weekend. I am going kayaking <endOfText>
<human> Oh, really? Kayaking is awesome! What a fun and adventurous person you must be.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, really? Kayaking is awesome! What a fun and adventurous person you must be. <endOfText>
<human> We are going hiking too so yeah I think so <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm 30 years old and living with my dad still. I am broke. I've been single for years. I feel like I have nothing going for me while my peers are out kayaking. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it will get better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planted sod in my backyard a couple weeks ago and it looked great until my dog got a hold of it. <endOfText>
<human> oh, well that sucks! It can be very aggravating to spend time working on something, and then have it destroyed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know my friend is going to come through this weekend. I trust his word <endOfText>
<human> That's great that you have such trust in him.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great that you have such trust in him. <endOfText>
<human> He is my best friend so its nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling a little down right now. I was supposed to meet friends for a little trip this weekend, but I got stuck working late at work. <endOfText>
<human> I bet they will miss you not being there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently applied for a new job and am waiting to hear if I got it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that is nerve-wracking! I hope you get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry. I hit a wrong key and sent too soon. I was going to tell you about how I ordered McDonalds with the new delivery service. <endOfText>
<human> ah it happens lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel something when I think back to where I came from. It makes me feel a bit nostalgic <endOfText>
<human> Feeling nostalgic can be great. Where are you from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Although things in my life haven't been going well for the last year or two, I am faithful that I've been a good person to others, so it will come back to me. <endOfText>
<human> Being positive is all you can do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to relax today and sleep. I was off of work <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice. I'm happy that you got some rest. What do you do for work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone on tv today that was pretty good. He was talking about saving money <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? Did you get any good tips from him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A close friend/co-worker recently got a promotion at work. I feel so proud of them. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of work is it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not go to the gym this morning. I felt bad about it <endOfText>
<human> Well, I guess if you're a pretty regular gym-goer, you shouldn't feel bad about missing a day every once in a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still think about a specific ex-girlfriend imparticular. She's always on my mind. <endOfText>
<human> I think that is normal, are you still friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a good feeling work was going to be good today. I went to bed with that feeling last night <endOfText>
<human> That is a nice way to wake up. Was it a good day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going back to work next week. My baby is almost 6 weeks old. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited to go back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty irritated in traffic this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Was traffic particulary bad this morning? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a senior and a sophmore in high school this year. <endOfText>
<human> Are they doing well in school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty upset that my real estate career in Florida did not go as I had planned. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try hard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad last weekend. All of my friends were off being busy it seemed <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you make any plans before the weekend started? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I qualified to shoot on the 1000yard range today <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that is impressive indeed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother offered to drive me to the doctor today. I had faith in him <endOfText>
<human> I assume he got you there ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not currently employed, but I am happy that I can at least make some income. <endOfText>
<human> Income is very important always <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guess we're lucky to have this opportunity. <endOfText>
<human> Luck has nothing to do with usually <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous this morning driving. It was raining hard <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes if the storm is severe enough, it's best to just pull over. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an old photo of my mom this morning. It made me miss the old times <endOfText>
<human> That's always fun to look at pictures. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat died the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, that is always sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The alarm at my work was going off while I was closing up. And the cops came by. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous going on a first date last weekend. I thought about not going <endOfText>
<human> That is understandable.  Did you end up going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if you're a religious person or not, but have you ever just had the feeling that you've got a blessing on the way? <endOfText>
<human> I have felt that for sure in the past <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty cocky over the weekend hiking a new trail. I was not going to quit <endOfText>
<human> What made you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt happy and cherished the moment this weekend with old friends. It had been awhile <endOfText>
<human> That is really nice.  What did you all do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone sneezed on me at the bus stop. <endOfText>
<human> That is so gross and rude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty depressed that I've been single for years now. <endOfText>
<human> That's nothing to be depressed about.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's nothing to be depressed about. <endOfText>
<human> I don't know, it feels pretty bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot find my mailbox key anywhere. <endOfText>
<human> Did you check the last place you had it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my kids candy from halloween this last year. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you deserved some candy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man who had a gun in his car last weekend. It scared me <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean.  My dad carries a gun in his car, so I won't let him drive my kids anywhere.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got a promotion at work. I was surprised in a good way at his paycheck <endOfText>
<human> That's great, good for him! It's always makes you feel good when your hard work is appreciated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous going to meet a girl. It was a blind date <endOfText>
<human> How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Are you going to see her again? <endOfText>
<human> I think so this weekend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry this past weekend. My paycheck did not go through <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's terrible. Did you get it resolved? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a date planned for this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have an MRI done on my head due to some medical symptoms, and I was really nervous about the results. <endOfText>
<human> That kind of stuff is always scary.  Do you have the results yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week we had a fire start in our bathroom. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is everything okay? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty happy with how my life is going these days, there is not too much to complain about <endOfText>
<human> Its always nice to have that perspective <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my cat to the vet this morning. I wanted to make sure he was okay <endOfText>
<human> What was wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked in a good way this weekend. My brother got us football tickets <endOfText>
<human> Well, that's good. Sounds like you guys will be having some fun watching the game. Much better than TV! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a real bad weekend. My girlfriend broke up with me <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset as a kid when the Eagles lost the superbowl, I cried a lot <endOfText>
<human> Well they made up for it last year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really shocked when the Eagles won the superbowl, but also so happy <endOfText>
<human> Why were you so surprised? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty mad last week. My ac broke and it was so hot <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's terrible. It's been so hot lately. I bet you struggled. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really excited about this coming weekend. It's my last free weekend before school starts back. <endOfText>
<human> Any fun plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I would have a good day today but someone ruined it. <endOfText>
<human> How did they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty alone last week. All of my friends were busy <endOfText>
<human> Thats never fun. Hope you can make time with them next week. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son has 10 years old and he is very good musician. <endOfText>
<human> A prodigy, huh?  What instrument does he play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous going to my job interview. I had no idea what to expect <endOfText>
<human> I hope you get it! What type of job did you apply for <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On the first date date I expect nothing more than interesting conversation, good laughs, and a delicious meal at a high-end restaurant. But I always bring mouthwash and some condoms just in case <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to be prepared <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat recently passed away and my coworkers got me flowers. They can be so thoughtful at times. It makes me feel nice. <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to have friends like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little down over the weekend. A girl canceled our date <endOfText>
<human> Never a good thing, did she have a good reason or ask to reschedule? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy this morning. A friend made me a nice breakfast <endOfText>
<human> That must have been nice.  What did they make you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I crashed my favorite classic car.  I've had it since I was 16. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is it able to be saved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When the Eagles finally won the superbowl, I was so so happy, I cried even <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord! I am glad you have something that is a healthy hobby <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad that people have to make others days crappy. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have an example? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be super scared of horror movies, but once I started watching them with other people, I got okay with it <endOfText>
<human> I don't like gory movies but scary ones I do. I used to be the same way as you, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a gloomy weekend. A girl didnt call me like she said she would <endOfText>
<human> Ah, maybe it will look up for you. She could still call? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling pretty nervous to return to Florida. I don't know if I have many options if I go back, or if it will turn out well or not. <endOfText>
<human> Just thinking positive thoughts <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am working from home and sometime I find it boring to not see other people. <endOfText>
<human> Ok, if that's what you decide to do I believe you have had time to think it through  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ok, if that's what you decide to do I believe you have had time to think it through <endOfText>
<human> I don't have a choice. It is the only job that I found. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am disgusted when I watch the way the Cowboys run their team, they let so many bad people play and make decisions <endOfText>
<human> Hey well at least they didn't do too bad last year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I give up on trying to figure out most women! I compliment her and give her my undivided attention and she pulls away. But the minute I start being unattached and talking to another lady she clings on desperately for my attention it drives me nuts hahaha <endOfText>
<human> Is this your girlfriend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day after work, I walked out to my car and saw that someone had destroyed my sideview mirror! They left a note that said "I had no choice" on the windshield. I'm so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what a jerk thing to do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know, right. No cameras in our parking garage either, so I can't even catch the guy somehow. <endOfText>
<human> That doesnt make sense, oh well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when I had to give my dog away. She was a good dog <endOfText>
<human> Aww I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she went to a good home.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she went to a good home. <endOfText>
<human> She did for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am alwys in awe watching my favorite band play <endOfText>
<human> What band is it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my dog died last year I was so sad. It happened randomly <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am anxious about this upcoming season for the Eagles, who knows what will happen <endOfText>
<human> Oh Football! Dosen't preason start this week? My husband likes the Los Angles Chargers but they arent very good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my family with my life, they are the first people I go to <endOfText>
<human> It is really nice to have a great family.  Do they live close by? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just celebrated my 50th wedding anniversary. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, holy cow, how old were you when you got married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was annoyed at the grocery store. The checkout line was so slow <endOfText>
<human> THat's terrible, did they not have enough open? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the town hall to renew driving license. The agent gave wrong information. Because of him, I wasted three months. <endOfText>
<human> I hate government officials like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got me a nice gift. I was shocked in a good way <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. What was the gift? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of the Eagles for their season last year, they really played well! <endOfText>
<human> They won it all if I recall. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got a new car. I am a little envious of what he got <endOfText>
<human> What kind of car did he get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish mt surgery for my back was today not in a month. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you have a bad back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sick when I saw a dead animal on the sidewalk. It made me feel bad <endOfText>
<human> I always hate seeing any kind of animal on the side of the road <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend cleaned out my car for me. It was so nice of him <endOfText>
<human> How dirty was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did well at work this week. I was happy with myself <endOfText>
<human> Are you gonna get a bonus for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends, I was very alone, it was a dark time <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you got out of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so scared of horror movies, it is my most hated genre by far <endOfText>
<human> I understand. Some people doesn't like those kind of movies. I am not a fan also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am saving money to be able to buy a new car. My current car is having too many car failures. I think one day it will stop working. <endOfText>
<human> What car do you want? I am in the same boat! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sitting in traffic today and let a person out, didnt wave or anything, that junk makes me so mad <endOfText>
<human> At least you tried to be nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have solve many problems today at work. My manager was happy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, you must be proud! I hope he praised you for your work and gave you a reward? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure how my future is going to turn out. I have been worried about that a lot lately. <endOfText>
<human> What have you been worried about?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What have you been worried about? <endOfText>
<human> Pretty much everything. I'm not where I want to be. Financially speaking: i'm a poor person. My health has really gone downhill this year. Pretty much everything isn't good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! I hope things start looking better for you. Can you file for disability or social security? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I have but the stigma attached to it has me feeling a bit ashamed. I don't know if I will be approved or not. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Traffic was hard tonight. It was so irritating <endOfText>
<human> I completely understand.  I get pretty aggravated myself driving home from work everynight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was teaching my daughter to drive today when I got pulled over by the cops. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, was the cop understanding <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty happy with my life right now, there is not much to really complain about <endOfText>
<human> Its nice to have that feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I skipped the gym this morning. I feel bad about it <endOfText>
<human> Why did you skip it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am appreciative of my girlfriend, she is very sweet and tries her best <endOfText>
<human> thats very nice to hear, how long have yall be together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wanted to play madden so bad and had to wait until today, all my friends got it tuesday <endOfText>
<human> Why did you need to wait? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel pretty confident about asking for a raise, I think I deserve it a lot <endOfText>
<human> I feel like you should to if you know you work hard go for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel pretty confident about asking for a raise, I think I deserve it a lot <endOfText>
<human> Why's that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I saw a homeless man on the street. I wanted to help <endOfText>
<human> I understand, I feel the same way sometimes. It's hard because sometimes you can't help or know they have problems that made them homeless like drinking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a friends house tonight. Nothing special but it was nice <endOfText>
<human> Ohh, what's that for? a party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At a shop, a seller was lying about the prices of the items that he was selling. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when they do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The rainy weather makes me nervous. I hate driving in it <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I hate driving in it. It is sometime to difficult to see the road. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always have a nice time driving my old truck. <endOfText>
<human> What truck is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of the Eagles for winning the superbowl, they made me so happy <endOfText>
<human> Did you have any money bet on the game ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been stuck on work travel away from home for the past few weeks. Last weekend was my birthday which I wasn't looking forward to spending alone. But to my amazement my girlfriend drove through the night to spend it with me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did you do anything special while she was there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being a kid. I saw a tv show today that made me think about that <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I understand! Life is easier as a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset with Nintendo recently, they have not had a direct in awhile <endOfText>
<human> I use to love those I didn't know they stop selling can you buy something else like different game system? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the park, I was attacked by a group of young teenagers. I am still shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Like actually assaulted or robbed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know, I feel like God is actually being really good to me, even though sometimes I complain or feel as though I don't deserve it. <endOfText>
<human> Being humble is the way to be <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to sit on my patio all weekend and read comics. It was calming <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that does sound nice. What comics were you reading? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, they are very smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses. Have you even been interested in athletics? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching my niece the other day, and seeing her playing made me miss my days of youth as well. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I know what you mean, those days were the best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with the way the new super smash bros looks, it seems awesome to me <endOfText>
<human> Nice, when does the new game come out? Or is it already out haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was very worried <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. What were you worried about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a big presentation at work today. I prepared really hard for it. Unfortunatley when it became time for me to present I got really nervous and just froze up. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh, I feel sorry for you. It happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sad when I think about my parents. They have been gone for a few years now <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that what do you do to try and stay enlighten and happy when thinking of them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait till next month. College football starts <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! My husband is a University of Arkansa Alumnai! We support the razorback football team. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having some financial issues. I am selling almost everything before the bailiff come. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you are going through that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad when my brother moved away. I was going to miss him <endOfText>
<human> It is always sad when one of our sibling move away. Why is he moving away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents caught me off guard when they gave me a car for my graduation gift, I was not ready for it at all <endOfText>
<human> Ohh that's awesome. Take some driving lessons and you will be fine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait till next week. We are going on a trip <endOfText>
<human> Where to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad last week when my car would not start. Its always giving me problems <endOfText>
<human> Did you have to fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very angry with how the cowboys team is given so much exposure when I was younger <endOfText>
<human> I hated them as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i always remember spending time with my grandparents when i watch old western movies <endOfText>
<human> What movies were your favorites?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What movies were your favorites? <endOfText>
<human> i dont have a specific movie, just the genre in general <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really happy with how my life is going right now, not many complaints! <endOfText>
<human> that's wonderful! I'm happy for you  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that's wonderful! I'm happy for you <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I'm very proud of my daughters grades on her yearly exams. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I assume she did well then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School is starting back next week and I feel like I have everything ready I need to. <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to be prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our car broke down and there was this knock sensor that needed to be replaced. it was too expensive to do it at the mechanics so i ended up fixing it by myself <endOfText>
<human> That is good. You are skilled. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like people kiss their dogs on the mouth. I find that disgusting. <endOfText>
<human> i totally agree with you! they lick their private parts and eat stuff from the floor, why would you wanna kiss them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was nervous going to the doctor this morning. I did not feel like going <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? I'm always nervous going to the dentist office so I can relate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend gave me his couch when he moved. It was nice of him <endOfText>
<human> Is it in good shape? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think about my childhood a lot, those were really great days, I love them <endOfText>
<human> I do too, its nice to have memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have high hopes for this season. I think my football team is going to do well <endOfText>
<human> Who are you rooting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got pizza and the toppings were really sparse. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that can be so aggravating!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that can be so aggravating! <endOfText>
<human> Yea, I mean, I would rather pay more than get skimpy toppings like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my team was going to win last week. They were playing well <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice. What sport? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a Costco cake. For myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, was it good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied all week for a exam I took this morning. I knew I would do well <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you are commited to school, thats great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to a Japanese restaurant. I'm surprised no one has thrown a knife across the place yet <endOfText>
<human> is it one of those restaurants where they cook right in front of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm absolutely terrified of big spiders. One day I was afraid to leave the house because there was a spider outside the door <endOfText>
<human> I feel that way about any size spider. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feed these 2 cats everyday, and they always hiss at me. <endOfText>
<human> hahaha that is really funny,  cats have a tendency to do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got a bonus at work. I was real happy with him <endOfText>
<human> He works for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel alone tonight! It's hard to put your foot down and give tough love. <endOfText>
<human> What happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's 8 year old kid cooks like a tiny Chef Ramsey. <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice to have around, what kind of food <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Traffic is irritating where I live. Its so random <endOfText>
<human> Was it bad today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to ask this girl I've been talking online with for a while out on a date. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome good for you, how long have you been talking <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid took care of his little sister all by himself yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That is cute. How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to renew my driving license. After 3 months, they told me that they lost my paperwork. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. The MVA is just so frustrating to deal with sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm watching my brother's dog this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> thats nice of you, what kind of dog> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i played in a cornhole tourney this weekend, was hoping to win, finished 3rd <endOfText>
<human> a cornhole tourney? I'm not familiar with that but third place is pretty awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost her job. But because she doesn't have any debt, she can pretty much work McDonalds and still be okay. <endOfText>
<human> that's great! I mean it's sad that she lost her job but being debt free is awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got the new madden today, i hope i am as good this year as i have been in the past <endOfText>
<human> How many Maddens have you got? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i've played competitively for about 15 years now <endOfText>
<human> Oh sweet. What rewards do ya win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to have dinner with friends today, but I was stuck at work. <endOfText>
<human> that always stinks, what kind of restaurant were yall going too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Instead of taking out an interest loan, my family loaned me money for home repairs for free. <endOfText>
<human> what a wonderful and supportive family you got! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to get my finances under control and have paid off some debts. A huge undertaking but I was determined! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Definitely a burden lifted off your shoulders! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really annoyed at my husband the other day when he left his dirty clothes hanging around. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh! Why can't people pick up after themselves! I'd be frustrated too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend said no, when I asked her to marry me. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Did she say why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometime, I have problem respecting my sleep schedule. So I wake up tired. <endOfText>
<human> It's hard to change habits sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when i got the day off! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Was it a surprise for you as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am packed ahead of time for my trip, that's a first for me! <endOfText>
<human> where you going! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm teaching my son how to change the outlets to our house. Makes me think about how my dad taught me. <endOfText>
<human> wow what a great thing to teach your son! It's also very bonding <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran out of my favorite lotion and i can't buy it in store. so i ordered one online and i got an expired one!! so annoying <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. That's so inconvenient. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started running, and oddly enough, I was first place in last weekend's race! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats, what kind of training did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's girlfriend cheated on him. I've never seen him so destroyed. <endOfText>
<human> That is too bad, is he okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got free pizza today! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What pizza did ya get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to the store, and the steaks were $1 per pound. I stocked up! <endOfText>
<human> What!! That's a crazy good deal!! where at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were supposed to go to the beach, but it's raining all weekend. <endOfText>
<human> time for Plan b <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was all alone the other day when my kids left <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Where did the kids go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Broke up with my girlfriend this past weekend. Feels weird coming home to no one <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Why did you broke up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, when I came back at home, I found that my girlfriend left me. She took with her some of my stuff <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What a classy girl. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family threw me an awesome surprise party for my birthday this year! <endOfText>

<human> what did you have? everything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for the weekend! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea? What are your plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked in on my friend coming out of the shower. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow! I bet that was so embarrasing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my life is so great! I have a beautiful wife, cute little baby and 2 cats. I have a job, a house and food on the table! and that's all i need <endOfText>
<human> that sounds wonderful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> This doesn't sound good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know how these chefs cut avocado so thin for sushi. <endOfText>
<human> have you seen them do it on youtube?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you seen them do it on youtube? <endOfText>
<human> I've seen them do it in person. It's crazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have very bad teeth and I feel embarrassed whenever anyone stares at my mouth. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try do to something about it? go to the dentist? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a dead fly in my jello. <endOfText>
<human> Disgusting. Did you ask for another one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to see that my son got perfect attendance for the entire school year <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing!! I bet you are so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes he didnt make a fuss a single day <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a really great kid, your doing a fantastic job!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shopping in a department store last month and saw some kids running under the clothes racks playing a game together. It made me think of when me and my little brother did that. I really miss him. <endOfText>
<human> where is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He is at college in Arizona, Im in Florida. Its expensive to fly him here or vise versa so I only see him maybe twice a year. <endOfText>
<human> oh .. well at least he is doing something good for himself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my wife is going overseas for 1 month. gosh i will miss her so much. i don't even know what to do <endOfText>
<human> oh man im sorry to hear that! where is she going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it would be nice if you could go with her! <endOfText>
<human> yes i agree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I will be going to a party later. <endOfText>
<human> oh nice, any special occasion?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh nice, any special occasion? <endOfText>
<human> No it is just a party but my girlfriend might show up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it really drives me crazy when i let someone out in traffic and dont get a wave <endOfText>
<human> Do you ever road rage them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a new computer for $1000 from Japan and it crashed in the first week. I'm getting a blue screen and it's not booting up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I would be furious to say the least! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still have the hammer my dad gifted me over 10 years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Do you use it or hold on to it for sentimental reasons? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran into my husband's car in the driveway today but lied about it/ <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, was there any damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little sad when i didnt win the lottery yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I am sad when I don't win the lottery. So I stopped playing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a drug addict. I need money for my addiction. So I rob teenagers outside college. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow.. thats one way to get the job done <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends were looking towards spending time together this weekend, but I have to work. <endOfText>
<human> darn, that's sad... can you guys reschedule it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a lot of poop on my yard. <endOfText>
<human> dog or human? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get my daughter what she wanted <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What did she want? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A nice storm came through here today and totally knocked some piece off my cable dish. The cable is not working like at all, so I called the company and they said they will have someone out tomorrow to fix it. I feel off the grid right now. <endOfText>
<human> What are you doing currently to make up for not having cable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I want privacy, but now that I have it, I miss my roomies. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I understand. But hey, you dont have to look at or clean up any elses mess anymore right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  knew it shouldnt have trusted by brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> oh no. what did he do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sometimes think my children are evil <endOfText>
<human> what do they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a pizza and it took an hour to get here. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. You must've been starving. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally finished painting my kid's room. I think it looks nice. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been quite a project. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I divorced, he has the kids this week for summer break. It's me, myself, and I in this apartment and it's eerily quiet. <endOfText>
<human> Now you have a lot of privacy and can do things that you want! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted this coconut pineapple cake, but they ran out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, will they have more in stock tomorrow? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i cant wait for next week! <endOfText>
<human> what's going on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The hot dog I got doesn't taste as good as it used to <endOfText>
<human> That's always disappointing. You have a certain taste in mind but it's not quite right <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Asked my crush out, and she said no. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did she give you a reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my first child was born, my sister came and helped us out. <endOfText>
<human> You got a good sister! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was stollen my wallet at work. <endOfText>
<human> I sorry to hear that, I hope you get it back. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my mom used to make me brownies. <endOfText>
<human> That should be delicious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was shocking to see Lebron leave the cavs again <endOfText>
<human> I know right, now he's a Laker. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss just bought a new boat. <endOfText>
<human> sweet.. do you have acces to it? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I found a text message on my wife phone. She is cheating on me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Did you confront her about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going sky diving and kind of terrified. <endOfText>
<human> I would be too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad about something I did today <endOfText>
<human> That doesn't sound good. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't afford my textbook, and my roomie made copies of the pages for me. <endOfText>

<human> Time to grab a blanket. You mean that it's inaccurate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Woah.  I would be too.  What do you think happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone hit it and fled <endOfText>
<human> How can people do that!  Its awful.  I think you can use those suction things to get dents out pretty well.  Sorry that happened to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband just came home early from a business trip and had dinner ready for me when I got home from work! I was shocked to say the least! <endOfText>
<human> thats cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He wasn't supposed to be home for another week but something happened and they had to cut it short. <endOfText>
<human> were you happy to see him early ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for my package to get delivered today <endOfText>
<human> What's in it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was shocked when i got the day off <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  Did you request it and just weren't expecting it or did you just get a random day off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> requested it but was told not to expect it to get approved <endOfText>
<human> I love when that happens!  Good, its about time you got it.  I hope you enjoy whatever you're doing with the time off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in a duplex and my neighbors keep parking their cars too far apart for me to park my one car and its a driveway for 4 cars. They really don't know how to park. <endOfText>
<human> how are you going to resolve this issue <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last time I dressed up I felt confide t. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kept all of my kids first day pics every year. They are in a book <endOfText>
<human> I need to try and do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting a second vacuum from the same company tomorrow and I truly hope it's not a doozy like the first one was! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am excited about the kids started back too <endOfText>
<human> How many kids do you have <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yesterday i was all alone! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt sentimental the other day while looking at some pics <endOfText>
<human> old childhood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not happy that the summer is almost over. <endOfText>
<human> I know, it feels like it just started. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just saved 20 percent on my car insurance by switching to another company. <endOfText>
<human> Was it the company with the Gecko? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Soooo .. I wanted to make sure I had everything. I packed a flash light, some matches, and a tent. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going camping? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thinking about my pets and a few loose cats I know of a lot the past few days and how I will always be dedicated to helping animals." <endOfText>
<human> Awww.. I love cats.. Sorry.. I was yelling at my boyfriend.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a lady spit all over her hands after coughing..and then sneeze, wipe her nose..then she TOUCHED the door handle <endOfText>
<human> what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am realizing that my kids are getting older and gonna leave me soon <endOfText>
<human> its almost party time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to see i was approved for the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. did you make plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once ran out of gas in my car while traveling across state. I had no idea where I was at the time. It was pretty scary. <endOfText>
<human> I've done that before.. it gets super dark on the highways and you don't realize it till you don't have any lights shining. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well.. I came home from work today and I opened the front door and you would believe what happened. <endOfText>
<human> Was it something good or bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> I would be too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so hungry and my husband is taking long bringing me food <endOfText>
<human> eat a snack <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom sold my grandmothers farm house and decided with some of the money she is going to take my family and my sisters family on a cruise for Spring Break. <endOfText>
<human> thats nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? I hope it was nothing really bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lady in my church is going through a hard time. Now I don't have much but I want to help her out however I can. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful of you! She is going through a hard time financially? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought some groceries today for someone I care about that is HARD to care about sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Why is it hard for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter's chihuahua was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease about a month after we had her.  She did pretty good with it for quite awhile. <endOfText>
<human> im so sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting older and to still see that people can be so untrustworthy and that they will be such betrayers and so hateful over nothing is hard to see <endOfText>
<human> thats the time we live in now....  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats the time we live in now.... <endOfText>
<human> That is very sad. I think there are people like this in every generation but it seems like everyone is getting more detached, more apathetic as the years go on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> I wish my sister felt that way about mine! lol. What kind of pets does she have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to register my daughter for school last week. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats an exciting time. is she excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She started yesterday. When I went to register her I had no paperwork though. I was so embarassed, <endOfText>
<human> we're all forgetful sometimes.  I bet there were plenty of people who didnt have paperwork <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss my old house sometimes <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. Why did you move <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was all alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> kids left home <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy the quiet time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a nice dinner, I feel great! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what did you have? I am so hungry right now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss living at home with my parents. They took care of everything. No bills or stress back then. <endOfText>
<human> I'm right there with you. Those were much simpler times <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my rent is going up soon <endOfText>
<human> gonna move to a new place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aim is to score high in my last exam. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will.. You seem to have studied hard last semester. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy!  I won a medal this week.. gold! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. My hearty congratulations to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son wasted juice all over my couch <endOfText>
<human> oh no. im sure it was an accident. is he young? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a person pulled over on the side of the road and looking frazzled, so i stopped <endOfText>
<human> what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's amazing how much the dog I have has recovered from abuse and almost being starved to death in just two weeks! <endOfText>
<human> thats wonderful .. hope they continue to progress <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too! Except now she drives me a bit crazy as poor girl seems to not know anything about house living and I don't think she ever experienced puppy hood- she is a year old. So now she is being a handful! <endOfText>
<human> yea thats understandable <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am happy its almost the weekend! <endOfText>
<human> What will you be doing this weekend/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A guy pulled out turning left right in front of us, he didn't even STOP in the turn lane and he made a semi circle to also pass the left lane and come ALL the way over to the right lane and cut us off. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds very dangerous. Were you afraid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a rock concert all by myself - my friends ditched me! <endOfText>
<human> Thats disturbing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish all kids could be happy <endOfText>
<human> yea? whats the matter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait to see if i got teh promotion at work <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do. IS there a big pay raise <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today a swarm of wasps was chasing after me. <endOfText>
<human> did they catch you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> How did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the skating rink all by my lonesome. It was quite depressing. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good, why didn't you bring a friend with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a scorcher outside today! I was so sweaty I thought I was gonna pass out! <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, sounds like a terrible time! Did you drink water? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started watching professional handball recently. It is such a great sport. I can't believe how good some of the player are. <endOfText>
<human> my dad used to play hand ball.it was very fun and interesting watching them play when i was a kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to lunch today. when i got up to go pay i realized i had left my wallet at home <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that is the worst feeling. Did you have to wash the dishes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movies alone. It was quite depressing. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds lonely. Why did you go alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was running late for work this morning. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. Did you get in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a few dollars short for an important bill I have due. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to be able to get that money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money out of my church's collection plate. <endOfText>
<human> Are you having desperate times? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just needed money for alcohol.  I feel so ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> I think you need to go and talk to someone, your pastor may be the best place to start. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park all alone. I was quite depressed. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! I am in that boat too! It can be very hard to be alone a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to put in an order today at the drive thru..and someone stuck their GUM on the speaker...Seriously? <endOfText>
<human> What savages! Did you tell the drive through guy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog crapped on the rug yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> did you rub his nose in it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> I would be mad too. Did you find the culprit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> nope.. just white streaks along with a dent <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I miss when my kids were younger. They wanted to spend a lot of time with me. Now they are too old for that stuff. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Yesterday, i had a night out with my friends, but i lied to partner that i will be staying late for work. I did not want to see her nagging <endOfText>

<human> Nice, what pet was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I had a dream I was at school but had no clothes on! <endOfText>
<human> That would be very scary! Were you able to find some clothes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week there was one day when I left home late to go to work. I was so worried on the entire trip that I would get to work late! <endOfText>
<human> Did you manage to make it on time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an important job interview this week <endOfText>
<human> Have you prepared well for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked by my old friends house today and got a blast of nostalgia. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah -  get that sometimes too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an important job interview this week <endOfText>
<human> I see, do you think you will get the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet last week <endOfText>
<human> It's lovely. Why did you take care? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother bought a new bike. <endOfText>
<human> oh nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a licensing exam Monday for the city. I studied so hard for it that I felt super confident when I was going in to the testing site. I ended up getting the highest score out of my entire class! <endOfText>
<human> im glad to hear that!!! hard work pays off!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wanted to order this miracle cure online but dont know if i should <endOfText>
<human> I don't think you should. Those are often scams. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a wasp in my bedroom when I woke up this morning <endOfText>
<human> Wow, did it scare you?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to use a public restroom at the airport. Ugh! <endOfText>
<human> I don't mind that - does it freak you out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been hoping to take a trip to Paris this summer but the airline fares are so expensive. I watch them constantly looking for them to drop down to something actually affordable. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah - the prices vary a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You were talking about Paris - have you ever been to San Sebastian in Spain? It's very beautiful. <endOfText>
<human> No, I've never been there either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been taking speech therapy classes to improve my Spanish. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> sounds like a pain! Do you know who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movies with my friend last week. Somehow my friend got very close with this random girl who was there. My friend ended up abandoning me to spend time with her. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks! I'm sure it hurt your feelings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, wow. I can't believe your friend did that to you. <endOfText>
<human> I know. My friend sometimes gets very self centered. It can be a challenge. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a wasp in my bedroom when I woke up! <endOfText>
<human> Did it wake you up? I would have been so scared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my words when giving a speech. I completely messed up! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Was it a important speech? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted by brother to care for my dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh sad. What did happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom gave me a surprise gift. <endOfText>
<human> what was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i stepped in dog poop barefooted today <endOfText>
<human> That's really disgusting. I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm ging to find a new job this week <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! I hope you find something good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week on a business trip I spent some time at the bar. There was this girl who was really flirty with me. I had to tell her that I couldn't play with her because I was married. <endOfText>
<human> Very admirable <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son graduated last month. It made me so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! What is he going to do now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have nobody to share the joys of my life with <endOfText>
<human> That must be lonely. Do you try to make friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i coulnt get my daughter the gift she wanted <endOfText>
<human> Yeah. It's tough sometimes. But maybe taught her a valuable lesson? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope to find a new job this week <endOfText>
<human> what type of job you looking for ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last night I was in a drunken state, and said bad things to my wife and children. <endOfText>
<human> Really? That's awful. Hopefully they understand taht you weren't really yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been expecting my friend to pick m e up for a shopping trip yesterday. Unfortunatley my friend never actually showed up. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Were they busy or did they forget? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You should not rely on her next  time. She seems unreliable! <endOfText>
<human> That's probably a good idea. I keep forgetting though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I celebrated my birthday last week. My parents had been working behind my back with my best friend in order to set up a trip to Miami for the two of us! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must have been so surprised! Your parents are so nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no one to enjoy the pleasures of life with. <endOfText>
<human> I'm very sorry to hear that. I'm hear for you if you need someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate a whole bag of cookies <endOfText>
<human> hahaha...ive been there and i have done that...what kind of cookies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> today was a great day. my nephew was born <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! You must be very happy. Have you met him yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working really hard on this project at work for the last few months. Suddenly today my boss took the project away from me for no reason! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's horrible. Did he even ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got  parcel the other day <endOfText>
<human> What was in the parcel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone yesterday <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started a new job.  I am looking forward to it being better than myy last. <endOfText>
<human> Excellent. How's it been going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the new soccer season to start <endOfText>
<human> Do you play soccer or watch it on television? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for my package to arrive today <endOfText>
<human> Really? What sort of package are you expecting>? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wrote a paper for class that I really didn't put much effort into. I got the grade back yesterday. It was a C. I was satisified with these results. <endOfText>
<human> i would have been fine with that grade too. are you doing well in the class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had mentioned to my husband that I was really interested in a Cane Corso puppy since our dogs are getting a bit older now. I really never thought he'd agree, but we had a discussion and decided we should start looking into getting a black male pup! <endOfText>
<human> That's very exciting. Have you decided to get one for sure? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate a whole pack of cookies <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! How were they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I invited my boyfriend's parents to a cookout out my family's house recently, and completely blanked on their names when it was time to introduce them <endOfText>
<human> Oh no - how embarrassing. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pregnant girlfriend accidentally fell down some stairs last week. She was fine but we've been so scared that she may have lost the baby. <endOfText>
<human> oh no.. is she ok ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to see that i had been given the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Dod you have any plans for the weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take a final exam for a class last semester. I studied really hard for it and went in sure that I was going to do great on it. I ended up getting the highest score in my class! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when i saw i was approved off for the weekend <endOfText>
<human> Cool! That's great news. Do you have any fun plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Currently, I am having some financial issues. <endOfText>
<human> that is the worst. i am sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i start a new job tomorrow. brand new carret <endOfText>
<human> That is good to have new challenges. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a test for class last week. I didn't prepare for it at all. So right now I'm so worried waiting for the results. <endOfText>
<human> Well its not in your hands anymore so its best to stay calm and not worry about it now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my girlfriend with another man. I was going to propose to her that day... <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I'm really sorry to hear that. That must have been shocking. Have you broken up now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been stuck at a work conference for the last two weeks across country from my home. My girlfriend shocked me last weekend by flying out here to spend time with me! <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a fastfood. Before ordering, I found a dead cockroach on the floor. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's really disgusting! Did you still eat there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> Oh I would be mad at them too! Do you know who it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I caught my wife cheating on me last week. Apparently she's decided that she likes women too. I don't know what to do about this. <endOfText>
<human> She shouldnt have done that without asking you. But maybe there is an opportunity here for you... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the mall and smelled a cologne that my ex used to wear. It brought back old memories <endOfText>
<human> Were they good memories or bad memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend wants to take me to the haunted house at the carnival this weekend. I really don't like haunted houses. But my friend loves them. I'm really worried about having to go through it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh do they scare you a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was irked when i saw someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Did you catch them doing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somebody stole a package off my front door! <endOfText>
<human> oh no <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is really great at math. When I was taking a really hard math course he was so happy to help me throughout it and I did great in the class thanks to him! <endOfText>
<human> You must have thanked him for it. He is a smart brother! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am finding it hard to let go of my grandfathers old Mercedes. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it can be tough to throw things out that remind us of special people. I still have some toys my grandma gave me when I was a baby. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a bees nest in my garden. They keep attacking me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that would be really frustrating. Have you tried to do anything about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend promised to drive me to the airprot. He never showed up and I ended up missing my flight! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Did you tried calling him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been trying to have a baby for a long time. My girlfriend thought she might be pregnant so she took a pregnancy test. Waiting for the results was so nerve wracking~ <endOfText>
<human> You must be feeling so anxious, yet so excited right now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son came first in the swimming gala at his college! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's an amazing accomplishment! You must be so proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really am! He worked so hard and it finally paid off. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great for him. Maybe he should try out for the olympics? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After graduating college I was having so much trouble finding a job. A friend of my dad's decided to give me a chance at his business. I was so thankful for the opportunity from him! <endOfText>
<human> That is great! How did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sunday will be so fun, I can't wait! We're going on a roadtrip <endOfText>
<human> Sounds amazing! Are you going any place in particular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend who's really great looking. He always attracts girls no matter where he goes or how he's dressed. I wish I could have that affect on people. <endOfText>
<human> that could not always be a good thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when someone dosnt take the hint to stop talking <endOfText>
<human> Yes that is incredibly annoying! I'm a quiet person by nature so that can drive me carzy quite fast! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new laptop pretty recently. Blown away by the performance difference from my old one <endOfText>
<human> You must be so surprised! Technology has really advanced in the last few years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled tea over myself at dinner with my in-laws and just wanted the earth to swallow me in that moment. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that must have been embarrassing... but it happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was sitting on a perch looking hungry. He asked for money but I didnt have any so I gave his a slice of pizza and he cursed me out. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Probably, he wanted money to buy drugs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, my car glass was broken by someone <endOfText>
<human> What!? Did they steal anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm expecting a friend who I haven't seen in years to come over tomorrow. I'm a bit nervous about seeing him as I'm not really sure how much may have changed since the last time I saw him. <endOfText>
<human> It's exciting that you will be able to reconnect with an old friend. I understand that you're nervous, though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to get together with friends tongiht after work. But apparently everyone I know is out of town. So I'll be all alone tonight. I don't know what to do! <endOfText>
<human> Get yourself some good food and watch a movie! Sometimes it's good to take some time for yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning on going out to a party this evening. I want to meet a new girlfriend and think there might be a good girl there. <endOfText>
<human> I bet your chances are high. Party at a friends or family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter had to get her vaccine shots recently, and i had to pamper her for days she was in such pain. :( <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry about that. That must have really been horrible for her... and you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it is I cant wait for them to me over with it sucks going every other motnh <endOfText>
<human> Wow that often. That must really be stressful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so excitied about going to my friend's big party tomorrow night! I really can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> Parties are so much fun! Are you celebrating anything special, or is the party just a get together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling so nervous! I have a court case coming up against someone who committed fraud against me! <endOfText>
<human> Oh good luck! I hope you're able to win. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought the first book in a series online last weke. The company messed up and sent me the whole series by accident. I was pleasntly surprised by this. <endOfText>
<human> That is a nice surprise! Did you get charged more later? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel alone all the time. I wish I had room mates. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. You can always look into new housing options. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is going away this weekend to visit her family back home. I'm very upset about having to spend the weekend alone. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! and you can't go with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a package randomly in the mail today. IT turned out to be a late birthday gift! <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? That must have been very exciting to get! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the hospital for minor surgery last week. I wanted a friend to come support me. But I wasn't able to find anyone available. That was somewhat annoying. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's annoying indeed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just arrived to work, got out of my car and spilled coffee all over myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's a terrible way to start your day. Did you still go to work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I did but I looked like a mess! ugh <endOfText>
<human> Well at least you managed to make it through the day. I probably would have just gone home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to be leading a nature hike this weekend. I'm very familiar with the trail and the park so I think I'll do a great job! <endOfText>
<human> that sounds like so much fun!!! staying the night over the weekend?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that sounds like so much fun!!! staying the night over the weekend? <endOfText>
<human> It's a two night trip in the mountains. We do have cabins so it's not actually camping in the wilderness. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i thought someone was talking to me , turns out they were talking to someone behind me. i answerd them <endOfText>
<human> That is always a bit embarrassing.  Did you blush?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is always a bit embarrassing.  Did you blush? <endOfText>
<human> i did blush and wanted to hide from everyone around. i played it cool though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a spider in my bathroom.... ive never ran so fast in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That must have been a really scary experience. What happened to the spider? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a licensing exam for the state. I thought it was going to be so easy so I didn't study at all. I ended up failing the test and feeling very frustrated at myself because of my lack of efforts. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are you able to retake it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son lied to me and it really hurt as a parent we just always want the truth. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Was it a big lie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it was and I dont appreciate it at all. I just cant believe he would lie about something to me. <endOfText>
<human> That's a pretty serious issue. You should punish him somehow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a presnetation at work a few days ago. I forgot my slides so I had to give it with no materials. That was a super awkward experience. <endOfText>
<human> Like something out of a movie! my god. Did you nail it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Like something out of a movie! my god. Did you nail it? <endOfText>
<human> Well I was quite flustered. But I think I did fairly well in the end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday was yesterday. Everybody seems to have forgotten about it though. I didn't get a single happy birthday from anyone family or friends. I thought it was really depressing. <endOfText>
<human> am sorry about that, you could have reminded them perharps <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a habit of playing video games. Now my daughter is playing the same game in updated version. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's funny!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that's funny! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah! whenever she plays the game, I remember my childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter won the spelling bee... All her hard work paid off! <endOfText>
<human> Excellent! Convey my congrats to her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Excellent! Convey my congrats to her. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you so much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a pet rabbit that i loved so much and she got run over by a car, the cars drive by so fast here <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry for your loss. Did you have it long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died, now im alone in my home. <endOfText>
<human> oh no are you planning to get another one ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im not sure. She was very old, I had her so long. <endOfText>
<human> what kind of breed was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find it a blessing to wake up everyday and be able to live life. <endOfText>
<human> i agree with that.every day is a new start <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it really is and i just feel lucky to be alive. we take it for granted sometimes <endOfText>
<human> yes we all do. i really fell you on that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> listening to metallicas ride the lightning album reminds me of high school. good times <endOfText>
<human> i love listening to oldies. music now isnt as good as it used to be! memories right  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love listening to oldies. music now isnt as good as it used to be! memories right <endOfText>
<human> the memories are the best! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I spilled some water on my pants by accident today. Looked like I peed myself. <endOfText>
<human> LOL! Oh no, we're you able to change right away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I caught up talking with my cousin... it brought back so many good memories <endOfText>
<human> Ah that must have been nostalgic. Did you grow up with your cousin? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an ad for Disneyland the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh really what was the ad about ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my car is a little newer, it does not keep breaking down anymore like the older one <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. Did you sell the old one to help pay on the new one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no i donated it, it was not even worth selling <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least you got a new car that doesn't break down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister finally graduated college and I'm so happy for her! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's a great achievement. You must really be proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I awoke to someone banging on my door in the middle of the night. By the time I got to the door I couldnt see anyone out there. I was so scared. <endOfText>
<human> Did you call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend randomly brought me a cake to thank me for watching her dogs while she was away <endOfText>
<human> yeah that was good to helping others. it was a go9d manner i loved it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, when  my kids were both at school, I would get lonely at home sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. It's usually either parents are happy they are out of the house, or sad that they're gone. I'm sorry you feel lonely.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can understand that. It's usually either parents are happy they are out of the house, or sad that they're gone. I'm sorry you feel lonely. <endOfText>
<human> Most of the time I'm happy and content but occasionally I get lonely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can understand that. Kids have a big presence and their energy creates a void. Hopefully you can find things to take your mind off of it. <endOfText>
<human> It's weird how they can drive you crazy when they are with you but you miss them the minute they are gone! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is. My youngest has been away all this week for his first summer camp. It's been both awesome and lonely. <endOfText>
<human> They finally go back to school next week and I'm looking forward to it but I know I'll get lonely at times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job recently. It was a federal job that took me months to apply and train for. After I gave my 2 week notice to my current employer, the federal organization pulled their job offer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go back to my current company and ask for my job back. They had already posted my position, so it caused some issues, but they were glad to keep me. <endOfText>
<human> Thank goodness for that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank goodness for that! <endOfText>
<human> I know. I felt lucky. And get this, a few days after they pulled my job offer, they called me back and said they had changed their minds! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left for school without letting my dog outside even though my mom reminded me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hopefully there isn't a mess to clean up when you get back. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a watch my grandfather had given me when I was a kid, but I seem to have misplaced it <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! When I misplace things, I try to retrace my steps. Have you tried that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids will sometimes go and play at my new neighbors house. <endOfText>
<human> That must be fun for them.  Our neighbor hood only has older people so my kids stay around the house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor works at mcdonalds but just bought a Ford Raptor, how can he afford that is what i'm thinking <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy! He must have got a loan. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had been in some problem which dissapoints me more <endOfText>
<human> What kind of problems? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> +my grand mother torchers me everyday <endOfText>
<human> You mean tortures? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very committed to my work. No matter how I feel, I have to press on and complete it. <endOfText>
<human> it was good habit i like it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone who was working with me today did not seem to understand the task. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to help them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole my brothers copy of Purple Rain. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a prince album? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My close friends promised to have a dinner together last weekend as we planned out. But after calling him several times, he did not respond or even call me back at all <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is quite strange, I hope nothing has happened to them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can not believe that airplane crashed. I cried all night. <endOfText>
<human> What airplane? Did you know someone on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saved up for so long to buy my car. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of car did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my friends got married. I have no one to hang out with now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's a tough change, but I suppose you'll have to try to join clubs and make new ones! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I did very well in my work and will have a fantastic design to show my boss! <endOfText>
<human> When will you show your boss the design? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister now works at Lockheed Martin. I wish that was my job <endOfText>
<human> That's really impressive! What do you like about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man walked up to me in a parking lot and told me to give him a dollar. <endOfText>
<human> That's strange. Did you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My work wouldn't give me the bonus that was promised. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was not faithful to her <endOfText>
<human> Oh god..well I hope she left you and you've learned that no one likes a betrayer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> lol. I broke up because I felt bad about the lies and guilt <endOfText>
<human> That/s disturbing kiddo..you lied and betrayed then you left. You have much to learn about life and how to treat others <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I recently did some research for my school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool, what was the research about?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh cool, what was the research about? <endOfText>
<human> It was about the different types of caffeine and their effects. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a very naive person, so I was completely shattered when my boyfriend came home and told me he was moving in with another woman. <endOfText>
<human> How long have you been with your boyfriend? <endOfText>

<human> What a great accomplishment! I can understand why you'd be happy about that. <endOfText>

<human> Whoops, guess you were embarassed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can never figure out why my wife is so grumpy. <endOfText>
<human> maybe she is getting older, mines a little grumpy as well but i accept it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My lawn is getting overgrown and I don't know if I can afford a new mower. <endOfText>

<human> Same here. I can sometimes remember where I was the first time Ive seen some to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i miss the old days when people would just talk and not have to check their phones every 5 min <endOfText>
<human> I miss that too! I am always telling everyone to get off their phones and be present.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss that too! I am always telling everyone to get off their phones and be present. <endOfText>
<human> Unfortunately this is the way we have to accept the world now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been thinking about taking a writing class, but I'm really not sure whether I should. <endOfText>
<human> it could come in useful but how often though? is it worth it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i miss the olden days when people would just chat not check their phones every few minutes in between a conversation <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I went out to a bar with one of my good friends <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. Are you really close to this friend? I wish I had more close friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend had a driving test and he borrowed my car. When he returned it, the right door had scratches on it. I was so mad at him <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Have you ever swam with the dolphins? <endOfText>
<human> No, but we are going on a cruise to Cozumel next Spring Break and I think that would be so much fun. Have you ever been? <endOfText>

<human> Woah that's nuts! Have you called to complain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is getting pretty good at playing the drums. I always wish I learned how to play an instrument, but never had the courage to. Glad that I motivated him to play and very happy that he's actually getting pretty decent. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, I'm with you, I always wished I continued to learn to play the guitar.  It's always a nice skill to have. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised to see my son mow the lawn with out even me asking him to. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, right on. It's nice when they become a little more self-aware and develop parts of the brain that help them realize it's not all about them, and that it's good to be selfless. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a bind not too long ago and I trusted my parents to help me out. <endOfText>
<human> Did they help you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very proud of my daughters. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a lemon cake two days ago <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sounds tasty have you eaten it yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got 2nd place in his second grade spelling bee the other day. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My cat died last year which was really hard to deal with <endOfText>
<human> I lost a cat before. Its a lot to deal with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting really nervous about my upcoming trip. I am going away for six months. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow thats quite a while <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a coworkers cubicle trying to get some information from them and realized he had the worst body odor I have ever smelt. It was repulsive! I couldn't believe he didn't realize it! <endOfText>
<human> wow that is embarassing for them! maybe they had a crazy night and had no time to shower? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this summer i have had the pleasure of being able to have my daughter stay with me, who usually lives in another city! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great!  You must have felt really happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty bummed, I have to dog watch my parent's dog all weekend by myself. <endOfText>
<human> you don't like this dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my toe last night <endOfText>
<human> Ouch! Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think I'll be able to go to the lake this weekend, I'm pretty bummed out. <endOfText>
<human> Awww what's wrong? Maybe going to the lake will cheer you up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just a couple more days and they are outta here <endOfText>
<human> You sound like me a few weeks ago with my relatives, since they have a bunch of kids under the age of 10. Sorry to hear you're going through the same stress.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You sound like me a few weeks ago with my relatives, since they have a bunch of kids under the age of 10. Sorry to hear you're going through the same stress. <endOfText>
<human> I love them but my ears need a break lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working hard as a waiter this summer. Kind of fun since it's helped me develop social skills.. One person even tipped me $25 when their order was only like $8. Caught me off-guard that someone wanted to be that nice to me <endOfText>
<human> I had some one tip me a $25 chip at the casino after seeing a pic of my daughter in my locket. I cried lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm proud of all the work I put into my car, it was a junker, now it's a monster! <endOfText>
<human> Do tell! What upgrades have you given it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into a footrace with a friend of mine a while ago. <endOfText>
<human> I havent done that in ages. How did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled my coffee on my way to work. That cost me $4 and I was really looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, if it had been in the coffee shop maybe it could have been replaced. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was already five blocks away. I had to drink the gross coffee at the office. I usually dont buy coffee so I was trying to treat myself. <endOfText>
<human> They have these new portable cup holders that attach to almost anything. Maybe that can help in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm prepared to dominate this last semester of college. Ready to graduate! <endOfText>
<human> I can't wait til I make it that far, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I a moving out of the city soon <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy or sad about moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm furious, all the classes I needed to enroll in this semester are filled up! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man!  That is horrible!  What can you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been collecting supplies for this hurricane season. I think I am ready for anything that comes our way! <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Always good to be prepared, makes things a lot less stressful if there is one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm improving myself to enter into a new life. <endOfText>
<human> What are you doing to improve your self? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew died in a car wreck. <endOfText>
<human> oh my god, so sad. how did that happen. Feel so sorry for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He crashed on a bicycle. <endOfText>
<human> sorry for your loss <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was very nervous and apprehensive when I first started lifting weights again. <endOfText>
<human> Good job, it's always good to hit the gym and to stay in shape.  I just started again as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just walked my dog 2 miles and now we are just chilled out, relaxing on the couch. It's been a good day! <endOfText>
<human> That's a good effective walk! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a job interview and thought I did really well. They just called to say I did not get the job. I really wanted it. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. don't give up though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter isgoing to do great this year <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll be getting a promotion in February. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! What will your new position be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new one bedroom apartment but I kind of miss my roommate. Its really quite now. <endOfText>
<human> I'm jealous of you. I've had a roommate the past few years since I'm in college. First one I had battle depression and mental illness, and even checked himself into a behavioral center because he was feeling suicidal. This recent roommate seems normal enough though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was playing rough with my relatives, running around outside, doing touch football. I think I twisted my ankle or something. I'm dumb and don't have health insurance this year.. Worried how much money I'm gonna have to spend <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully it is just a sprain. Might not need to receive medical attention. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This printer is driving me crazy! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Have you called IT? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really excited for dove season that starts next month <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun. What are you most excited about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe I broke her vase. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, whose vase did you break? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of my brother's new job. He's going to be making 6 figures! <endOfText>
<human> What job did he get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so looking forward to college football season, Saturdays are going to be awesome! <endOfText>
<human> Fun friends and good food. Who is your team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just took visited my friend in the hospital that had a baby. I love being around new borns. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that's awesome, it's always a joy to see a new born baby experiencing it's first view of the world! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is, those quiet snuggle naps. Makes me miss my kiddo being little. <endOfText>
<human> How old are your kiddos now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so grateful to have awesome neighbors, they look after my house when I'm on vacation! <endOfText>
<human> That must be nice. You can focus more on enjoying yourself while away. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made in A in all of my classes last semester. I have never done that before. I am really happy with myself. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That is great, definitely will help your gpa.  Plan on doing the same this semester? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids were sweet when they wre babies <endOfText>
<human> Aw, are they not anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid, I would bake a cake for my dad's birthday and take it to his job at the fire station. <endOfText>
<human> That's incredibly sweet. That's like the best birthday gift too, since it probably tasted really good, but then showed your time and effort all in one. I heard once to make them taste like a professional made it, you just add like extra eggs and sugar and butter or something <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Smacked a fly on my desk earlier. Was really happy that I finally killed it.. noticed it was really big.. looked closer to see why.. and it had lil babies crawling out of it onto my desk! Didn't feel like eating lunch after that <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh that's disgusting!!! I hate when there are flying things buzzing around Soo annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won first place in a chili cooking competition at work today. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get a nice prize for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could've believe my eyes seeing my mom walk down the isle and getting her degree. <endOfText>
<human> Congradulations you must be very proud of her! What is her degree in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought groceries to make the kids' school lunches <endOfText>
<human> What kind of lunches do you like to pack for them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, my mom thinks she's sooo funny every christmas because she always wraps up one of the gifts in a poptart box (or something similar). The big surprise this year was I opened my present up and it really was just poptarts this time. <endOfText>
<human> Lol! That is hilarious. I hope you got it on video <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked up on a snake in my backyard a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's never a fun thing to do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got back from a job interview. It went really well. I feel I might get an offer. <endOfText>
<human> What job did you interview for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe I just saw all my possessions disappear. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my deceased grandfathers watch in an old box in my parents attic. It is actually quite valuable, but I don't think I could bring myself to sell it. It has way too much meaning to myself and my family. <endOfText>
<human> I believe there are things in life that are irreplaceable and priceless! There is no amount of money that can give you the true value of your grandfather's watch. I think you should pass it down to your grandchildren. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a 7 year old daughter that asked to play piano. I found a piano teacher and she is very intense. I thought she would scare my 7 year old but she has excelled in just 7 months of playing. Maybe the teacher is not all that bad. <endOfText>
<human> Wow!  That is amazing!  I guess a little tough instruction and training has paid off!  No need to worry then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited for the fall <endOfText>
<human> What is going to happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A fly landed in my cup of coffee this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Ew, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, That's unfortunate. Sorry to hear. were you close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you are finding ways to cope with your loss. That can't be easy to deal with. <endOfText>
<human> It really is difficult, I've started therapy recently. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope that helps you and that you find peace. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too it's a difficult time for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset when my daughter left with my earbuds <endOfText>
<human> I'm guessing she didnt ask to use them?  Has she taken them in the past? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finished last semester with a 3.5 GPA. I cant believe I did that well. All that hard work paid off. <endOfText>
<human> You worked hard, what are you studying in school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My major is Finance. I will shoot for a 4.0 this semester. <endOfText>
<human> I believe you can do it, what do you hope to get a job doing after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to see my favorite guitarist last night, he was amazing. <endOfText>
<human> Amazing. I bet that was awesome. Do you play yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently moved from Alabam aall the way to Indiana. I like it a lot better, but I hate having to leave my family behind. I miss them. <endOfText>
<human> Yea that is really far. Give it some time and I am sure you will meet some new people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really good about this job interview I have coming up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, good luck on it! What are you applying for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me happy to see my cat waiting for me at the front door when I come home after a long day of work <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that is really cute of your cat to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't order chicken anymore from restaurants <endOfText>
<human> Why not? I LOVE chicken! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got sick the ;ast time and i am too scared <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Maybe the restaurant you ate from wasn't clean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I'm driving around and I see a stray dog or cat, I feel so bad that I can't help but stop to pick them up and bring them home! I can't believe how many people neglect their pets! <endOfText>
<human> Its sad. How many rescues do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I appreciate you. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks, I appreciate that. I hope others get inspired to do something similar when they hear my story. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my dog passed away a couple of weeks ago. Its been really hard not having him around. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  How old was he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had him for 12 years. <endOfText>
<human> What type of dog was he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a hair in my sandwhich at lunch. <endOfText>
<human> That's gross. Did you make the sandwich yourself or buy it from a restaurant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate it when you're feeling confident in a new hairstyle or some clothes you're wearing, and then someone makes fun of you? Had that happen the other day. Makes you want to be able to hide in the background and never try anything new again <endOfText>
<human> That is just the worst, who made fun of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad when my cat passed away. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. I lost my dog a few years ago. What's worse is I wasn't around when it happened--I was out of the state. I hope you at least got to say goodbye. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work the other day, just sitting at my desk. <endOfText>
<human> ... then what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a particularly meaningful Thanksgiving gathering with my family. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's good!  What did you all do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Each of us took turns saying how thankful we were about certain things in our lives. <endOfText>
<human> We do something similar at our Thanksgivings.  Did you make a home-cooked meal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i never really had thought to do this, but the other day I just grilled spur of the moment and watched the sun set with my sister. It was really nice, honestly. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds pretty awesome.  What did you guys grill?  Was she over for a special occasion at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughter has matured so well <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Get to hang out and play cards with my girlfriend and her parents. Her parents are actually pretty laid back and fun to be around, so I'm looking forward to it. Glad I don't have to deal with overbearing in-laws like some people <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Were you nervous at first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the past couple of months I have barely cooked. We have eaten a lot a fast food. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I see. Yeah, that's an easy habit to have. I would be that way too if I wasn't too cheap to spend money. I just try to do a lot of croc-pot stuff since I stink at cooking and am poor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am bummed out today. I failed a big test and my co-worker passed. <endOfText>
<human> OH no! Did you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have had this roommate for a year. Decided to renew lease with him. Been pretty good so far.. except he has a problem remembering to flush the toilet--no matter whether it's #1 or #2. Getting kind of old. <endOfText>
<human> That is a very big problem to me! However, if you signed a new lease with him it seems as if you can deal with it right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm impressed with my new used car that I bought for cheap. It runs great. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats. you are lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughter gets to pick the movie tonight for movie night <endOfText>
<human> That's fun, do you think you will enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to fend off this girl at a party. <endOfText>
<human> What was she doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from work.. and opened my mail up.. and you won't believe what I got in the mail. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get in the mail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you own a pet? I feel very motherly toward my cat lol <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling! I have 2 dogs and 1 cat. Love them to death. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting anxious about visiting my girlfriend's parents this weekend, it'll be our first time meeting. <endOfText>
<human> Why has it taken so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked. I was at the state park walking through the woods and I swear I saw a Bigfoot. <endOfText>
<human> I would have been so excited lol.  What did it look like?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My younger sister graduates from college this year, I can't believe she's going to get her degree. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome though.  I didn't graduate until I was 40 something <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so happy I have my dogs in my life, they are so loyal and happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's very sweet. I was just dog-sitting my neighbor's dogs last week. They were a little annoying at first, but I had to watch and stay with them the whole week, and I really grew to like them. They felt like my little sisters I had to take care of and play with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having to pee a lot lately. I know that's one of the symptoms of diabetes, and my dad has diabetes, too. Kind of worried to go to the doctor and get checked out. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been drinking more water lately? or it's just happening for no reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like it's been for no reason, but I might be paranoid. Everything has been the same so far. I just figured I'd go get a check-up anyway, since it's been a while. <endOfText>
<human> That would be a good idea, it's better to get tested and treated early if it is anything serious! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to put gas in my car and I ran out of gas on the side of the road! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my!  You must have been pretty embarrassed.  Did someone bring you gas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter and I just got home from her high school freshman orientation. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! How was that? do you think she will enjoy high school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma passed away earlier this year. We used to always get together as a family and play cards on sundays. This sunday is the first time we're doing it again without her. It will feel weird, but nice to be with family again <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's so sad. I'm sure she would have wanted ya'll to keep having fun times together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My children ask me so many questions every day <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man, mine too! It's so annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to buy a new phone soon, I've been having this one for so long. But I'm having a hard time letting go, I'm sort of attached to it. <endOfText>
<human> Is there not an upgraded version? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad. Someone took my crystal ball. <endOfText>
<human> I would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would have though that your crystal ball would have forewarned you? ;) <endOfText>
<human> No.. in fact... I can't even try to get it back now because the energy in it is now ruined. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Summer is almost over, school is starting again soon. <endOfText>
<human> I feel your pain totally.  I take an online class and I am a teacher at a new school this year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised that I was able to get into the apartment I wanted without any problems. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I hate looking for apartments. I'm in college and have looked for apartments for the past three years. It gets really old after a while, since I'm on a budget and it's hard to find something cheap but not a rat's nest. Glad you found what you wanted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So... Last night I saw a huge black spider in my room. Took me like 20 minutes to muster up the courage to attack it. Well... I tried attacking it, and missed, and it went behind a piece of furniture and I couldn't find it again. I slept in another room.. <endOfText>
<human> I hate that!  Knowing a spider or any sort of bug is in your room and then knowing you have to go to sleep.  I would have done the same thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of anyone who doesn't have to deal with student loan debt! <endOfText>
<human> LMAO.  LOLOL.  I pay 600 a month.  You? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was totally disappointed today. No one remembered my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad, well, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's sad, well, HAPPY BIRTHDAY! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you!  Its ok I guess because I am old anyways. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband went away on a week long business trip, and took our dog with him <endOfText>
<human> Ah, so are you feeling pretty lonely? That's interesting that he took the dog with him on a business trip, but who am I to judge! Could be viewed as kind of cool that he's that close with the dog. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in school right now and unable to pay for much since most of my money goes towards bills and that's it. My girlfriend is out of school and working, and so when we do go out, she has to pay a lot of the time. I feel bad for making her do that, but I don't have much of a choice <endOfText>
<human> Aw, you shouldn't feel bad!  At some point you'll have more cash and do the treating.  There's a lot of give and take in relationships. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite neighborhood restaurant is closing <endOfText>
<human> What restaurant is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe my professor marked all this wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Marked what wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to take the risk and start my own gym downtown. I think it'll do well, though! I know a lot of power lifters and bodybuilders. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congratulations! That is a really cool endeavor! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel a bit sad about this weekend. I have to work on a big project for work instead of visiting my family. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Hopefully after this project you can get some time off to spend with your family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really impressed with our city's new freeway, it makes getting to work so easy! <endOfText>
<human> That is always a good thing.  Is it free or a toll road?  Where I live most of em cost money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't wait til my wife gets home, I'm surprising her with flowers and dinner. <endOfText>
<human> She is most certainly going to enjoy that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for my daughter starting school week after next. <endOfText>
<human> Yay! is it her first year or just excited to get some free time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently, I've been working on a presentation for a client at work <endOfText>
<human> Interesting. What is your presentation about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Soo the other day I was driving, got cut off, and when I honked at the other driver to let him know he almost hit my car, he flicked me off. I'm still bitter about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks, I would honk harder at him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I glad I can afford the necessities and a little of what I want <endOfText>
<human> I hope you goodluck in the future <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe he won't let me play baseball anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's terrible! If you don't mind me asking <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's terrible! If you don't mind me asking; Who and why? <endOfText>
<human> My stepdad won't let me play baseball anymore simply because I hurt my arm throwing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really bad. I cheated on my husband. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got all my fishing gear packed up. I'm ready for tomorrow morning. <endOfText>
<human> OMG I am so jealous I love fishing.  Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This lady at my work is so sweet, and no one there seems to like her. I feel so bad for her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, bless her heart. I hope you are nice to her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband was in an accident a couple of years ago. A van pulled out in front of him. A woman we knew was in it and she passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well that's terrible! Hopefully, your husband was okay and nobody else was hurt. But, it's awful that anyone was. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So happy to have got my exam back and passed the class. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats!  What class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car was backed into at the store last week.  I found out yesterday that the person who hit me does not have insurance! <endOfText>
<human> That's going to be a pain to fix yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just found some of my long lost CD's. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome , i have not purchased cds in ages lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Okay so I've never been a good cook but the first time I ever made a casserole was a diasaster. I went to pull it out of the oven and part of my oven mitt must have not been insolated well, so I dropped it and it shattered the door to my stove. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! All that work for nothing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a tire low on air but, a co-worker of mine had an air compressor in his car he let me use <endOfText>
<human> That is good that he had an air compressor. Low tires seem to be the story of my life. I seem to always have to be airing up a tire. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is going to be a senior in high school this year. I am so excited for her. I think I'm prepared to deal with this. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome.  Is she going to university after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter finished her degree and got a job in her field right away. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Not too many are able to do that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No it's pretty rare. She's in Digital journalism, and she's working as a social media manager. It's a good gig. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome. I'm glad that she has things going for her, and congratulations to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I eat food from my home country I get nostalgic <endOfText>
<human> What type of food do you miss most? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was terminal, and the doctor said they caught it too late. <endOfText>
<human> What?! Are you sick or your family member? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered something online and unbeliveably it was here the next day. I wasn't expecting that! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting!  Who did you order from that gave you such good service? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We got to go to Walt Disney World this February.  We didn't think we'd be able to go. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I went a few months ago and really enjoyed it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a mouintian lion this morning when I was walking to my truck. <endOfText>
<human> wow that's great your are so lucky to see it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to go to Australia in a few weeks! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting!  Is that your going to be your first time visiting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live at home alone with my cat, but she had to move out for a week when we were doing some construction. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, was she stressed out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away a few weeks ago. She was 12. I really miss her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!  My dog passed away recently too so I can relate to your pain.  I am so sorry for your loss <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, and to you too. They really are our best friends. <endOfText>
<human> Most definetly she was my constant companion.  It will hopefully get easier for us each day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so pissed off at Trump, he is the worst president ever. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel that way?  Has he enacted any policies that directly affect you or anyone you know?  For the record - I'm not too fond of him either, just curious more than anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner bought me a gift for my birthday, I wasn't expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> That is very thoughtful.  Happy Birthday! What did you get from your partner? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was midway through a presentation at work today when I got a text from a coworker... <endOfText>
<human> What did it say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe my dad helped pay for my school. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Have you been going to school for a while or is this for first semester. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole my luch out of the refrigerator in the break room! <endOfText>
<human> What did you have in there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad it's finally August! It hasn't cooled off yet but all of my favorite holidays come up soon, and I'm really looking forward to the cooler weather. <endOfText>
<human> What's your favorite holiday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I think of the future, I am very positive. <endOfText>
<human> That's good! I think a lot of older people are pessimistic about the future, but I grew up on technology and am excited to see what new stuff comes out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always try to be prepared before a big trip. <endOfText>
<human> That's smart. You don't want to forget anything. Are you planning a trip soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to reminisce about my childhood. I grew up during the 80s. <endOfText>
<human> I did too. Graduated High School in 85 <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to make a pit stop at the gas station this afternoon to get gas.  I bought a scratch off lottery ticket too. <endOfText>
<human> Pit stops can be fun.  How did you do on the scratch off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The club couldn't contain me when I walked in with a fresh new cut and kicks on. <endOfText>
<human> Hahaha, that sounds like fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting to hear back about a promotion at work <endOfText>
<human> What type of work do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend my friends and I went away on holiday and two of them got belligerent drunk and completely ruined the night. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens.  Did they end up apologizing at all or did they play it off like nothing happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite watch broke today. :( <endOfText>
<human> That's no good, how did you break it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So excited to get my marks back from chemistry. <endOfText>
<human> Which chemistry class are you taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to think about the past and my childhood days. <endOfText>
<human> What are your favorite parts about your childhood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got an employee review at work on monday. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it goes well!  Are you worried? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next month I teach a beginning cake decorating class. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a lot of experience baking cakes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going horseback riding for the first time this weekend.  I am really nervous for some reason! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow I have never been either.  Try not to be nervous!  Who are you going with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe my friend got those nice shoes and I didn't. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad, did they fit your style? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I cheated in a math quiz, I really shouldn't have <endOfText>
<human> How come you had to cheat on the quiz? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend surprised me with a birthday trip <endOfText>
<human> Where are you guys going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing the bruins play on the ice was amazing. <endOfText>
<human> My favorite team used to the Bruins, but then I moved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was Valentine's Day, and the jerk I was dating at the time turns around and tells me he's leaving me for his ex. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that was absolutely terrible! He certainly picked the worse time to do it. You're right, he was a jerk! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss pulled me into his office and gave me a raise! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome!  I bet you were really excited!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats awesome!  I bet you were really excited! <endOfText>
<human> I was! It was quite unexpected, but very welcome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids don't listen to me as much as they should. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe its time to instill a little discipline. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every hurricane season I make sure to stock up on water and the essentials just in case. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been through many hurricanes?  We stock up in case a tornado takes out the power. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through my Grandma's old recipes the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's so sweet. Did you find one to make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday my sister left to go back to her state <endOfText>
<human> Oh that must be hard.  Are you guys really close <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to ask my for a raise at the end of the week.  I feel I deserve it but am really nervous to bring up the subject to him. <endOfText>
<human> You have done such a great job! You should be proud of yourself and not be afraid to do so.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You have done such a great job! You should be proud of yourself and not be afraid to do so. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, my wife says the same thing.  My boss is kinda intimidating though and it causes me to second guess myself at times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sucks that I didnt make the team, I tried so hard. <endOfText>
<human> What sport are you talking about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry at myself lately. <endOfText>
<human> How come you're so angry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a flight next week and I haven't been on a plane before <endOfText>
<human> Well, I'm sure you are super nervous! Of course, I have no doubt all will be well and a new experience for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that my wife is pregnant today. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend just left me, this is awful. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Did she say why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Find a new girlfriend.  That ship has sailed.   If you're really still want her consider trying to play the jealousy card.  (ie; make her jealous) <endOfText>
<human> I'm gonna do that, thank you for the advice. I could try to kiss someone else to make her mad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm proud of my wife and children for always being there for me. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How old are your kids? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My headphones have replacable wires, so I bought a replacement cord for them. It arrived and I didn't realize but it is EXTREMELY short. Wish I hadn't wasted my money. <endOfText>
<human> Can you send it back for an exchange ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My therapist was so kind to me, I had to tell her a lot. <endOfText>
<human> That's good you have someone that you can talk to about your problems and feelings. I'm sure it helps! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know I really don't trust many people due to a traumatic event from my past. But when EP came along he made me believe in humanity again <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you have had a difficult time.  What is EP? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home today after a long day at work in a pretty foul mood. <endOfText>
<human> Well, work can be stressful for many and do that. Often, we can bring it home with us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my girlfriend broke up yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that.  How are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 15 year old dog just died.  He was my buddy and I am all broken up because of his passing. <endOfText>
<human> Man that is really hard.  I can relate however b/c my sweet Riley(dog) just had to be put to sleep due to congestive heart failure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I baked recently and I was happy to find that my cheesecake was fluffy like the Japanese kind <endOfText>
<human> Yummy! That's great. It's always nice when you bake something and it turns out just right. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching TV and was just thinking about how much I wish friends was still on the air. I miss that show. <endOfText>
<human> You could always watch it online! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister got a new pair of shoes. They were the same ones that I had been wanting but can't afford. I should have been happy for her but I wasn't. <endOfText>
<human> A little jealous much?  Maybe you should pick up a side job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a good day at work, now i'm kicking back and watching TV for the rest of the day. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. You deserve to take some time for yourself. Anything special on that you want to watch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby napped for three hours today, which is NOT usual. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, You think you baby might be a little sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope my real estate lady comes by Monday. She said she was busy and to call her Monday morning <endOfText>
<human> They are very busy but if she made an appointment with you then she should be there on Monday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at my co-worker today! She had the nerve to tell our boss that I was rude to a patient, which is completely out of my character <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hate situations like that, when you still have to see people like every day, ugh. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an amazing brother. He's so great to talk to. I can tell him anything! <endOfText>
<human> How old is he? Is he mature? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He's in high school, but he is very mature for his age. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you! I hope you keep being friends forever! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got my sister a line on my cell phone line <endOfText>
<human> I bet she was really happy about that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet she was really happy about that. <endOfText>
<human> she was, but I am not. I think she has paid on time maybe twice in two years <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It would drive me crazy also, she should be more considerate. <endOfText>
<human> exactly <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my new vacuum finally! It works great and has great suction power. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Did it cost you alot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the top of a building for a work meeting. I'm scared of heights so it made me very very nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I would feel the same! heights are scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A manager from another team is trying to undermine my work. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you on that. That is awful. Is there anyone above him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone screwed up a work task that I was partnered with. <endOfText>
<human> Why this happened? Is he bad at what he is doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait until I pay off my car <endOfText>
<human> It will feel good when it done though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt died and it was really upsetting. She was my favorite aunt too <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, she is in a better place though. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad gave me an old coin that used to belong to his grandfather, who died when I was young. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. What did it look like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a few friends over for drinks the other night <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really nice.  Did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager have me new challenges to achieve. I am sure that I will succeed. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you will! You sound confident in yourself, and I'm sure your manager is, or he wouldn't have trusted you to do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about attending my firearms class. I think I will fail the test. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think you will fail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to this weekend in some ways. I am hoping that GOOD positive things will happen. <endOfText>
<human> What things are you looking forward to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am appreciative of my girlfriend, she is very supportive and sweet! <endOfText>
<human> How does she help you out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really excited for the new super smash bros coming out, that will be such a fun game! <endOfText>
<human> i haven't played video games in so long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i can't stand going to the bathroom at work after someone else. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad that I didn't finish painting my mom's house. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you finish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has been lying to me for a year <endOfText>
<human> What has she been lying about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My landlord is boring everyone in the building. He is here every day asking questions. <endOfText>
<human> What does he ask about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had wanted to wear a pair of earrings that my grandmother gave me to her funeral. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you wore them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had someone at work ruined our project and wasted my time it made me incredibly angry. <endOfText>
<human> How'd they ruin it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds like a mess, were they punished in some way? <endOfText>
<human> I hope so. I reported them but who knows? You know how some bosses don't care :/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A coworker is stealing money at work. He threatened me if I said anything about it. <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for the football season, I hope the Eagles can repeat! <endOfText>
<human> I am not a football fan. What did they do last season? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away, I was not equipped to handle that <endOfText>
<human> How'd she pass away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros game, it looks amazing! <endOfText>
<human> I used to play that game with my little cousins <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so excited for the COD beta today. <endOfText>
<human> Call of duty? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neice left such a mess over here today <endOfText>
<human> How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got a yoga mat for free at work today. i'm thinking about trying it out <endOfText>
<human> Very cool! Have you ever done yoga before or would this be a first time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone used some racial slurs today and it really made me angry. I freeze with anger when that happens <endOfText>
<human> OMG! I don't blame you. I would be extremely upset also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mine does also! It seems like it just keeps getting worse and worse. <endOfText>
<human> So true! Especially since you know who got in office...A big bully! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away, I was not equipped to handle that <endOfText>
<human> I don't take death well either! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy I can afford to take care of my health. If i need something special or specific, I can just buy it usually. <endOfText>
<human> That is certainly a blessing, good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends, I felt very alone, it was a dark time <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Three is a good number of kids for me <endOfText>
<human> How many do you have now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My landlord entered my appartment without notifying me. I was sleeping. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate scary movies, they scare me so much, especially jumpscares <endOfText>
<human> I understand. I had that problem when I was kid. Now it is ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends, I felt very alone, it was a dark time <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to have to walk hours to my grandmothers after school. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you not get driven there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY mom had moved across town. She would drop me off at school and I would have to walk there after. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is not safe at all for a kid though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy with my life now, I have a good girlfriend and friend group <endOfText>
<human> That is great! I bet you are feeling very good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away, I was not equipped to handle that <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to win the lottery! <endOfText>
<human> Gotta play to win, that is what my grandma always said <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy with my life now, I have a good girlfriend and friend group <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. You guys hang out a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a movie on demand last night and my kids watched like 5 minutes and left <endOfText>
<human> What movie was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate was stealing money from my closet in my room. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do to him after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate scary movies, they scare me so much, especially jumpscares <endOfText>
<human> Same here. I can't do it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i didnt expect to get the day off today <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a statistics tutor over the summer <endOfText>
<human> how did it work out for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super sad today. It's the weekend pretty much and I have a hard time with loneliness on the weekends especially. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry. Maybe not focus as friday-sunday as the weekend, but as any other day. And do things you would normally do on other days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I went out to eat with my friend. And there was a customer who was just very rude and vulgar. My friend and i gave each other "the look" and realized we were having the same thoughts. I was surprised. <endOfText>
<human> (Thank you for your words! I have a mom to talk too, so it helps but loads of trauma, abuse and death are hard to even talk about. Thank you! I hope you feel better too!) I have had to talk to customers who were nasty to clerks before! It's shocking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> (im glad to hear you have someone. But having someone who cant be biased always helps too) It really is. Some people can get so nasty and vicious over the smallest things! Im so glad i got out of the food industry. <endOfText>
<human> I know right? Oh lord- the food industry is the worst, especially for waitresses. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Waiting for pizza to come. I ordered extra of everything. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhhh yum!  What are your favorite toppings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were going to the lake for a weekend getaway since we haven't had some downtime in forever and then we got sick instead. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Did you reschedule? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandma passed away, I was not equipped to handle that <endOfText>
<human> how did you manage <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new semester is starting up next week and I am crossing my fingers it will be a good one. <endOfText>
<human> If you go into it with a good attitude, I'm sure at the very least it won't be bad. What kind of classes will you be taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping the Eagles can win it all again this season! <endOfText>
<human> Why do you like the eagles? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a argument with my manager. I think that I will be let go soon, <endOfText>
<human> What did you argue about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate scary movies, they scare me so much, especially jumpscares <endOfText>
<human> What movies do you like to watch instead?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What movies do you like to watch instead? <endOfText>
<human> I like action movies and comedies mostly <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids were so lazy this summer <endOfText>
<human> Hahahaha, that is the way sumer is supposed to be for kids.  Did they at least do the things you asked them to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no. They just wwanted to sleep all day. Even when we took trips. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh no, its worse than I thought.  It's one thing to relax, but that's different.  What are you doing to whip them back into shape? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my wallet stolen today. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Where? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for the upcoming school year <endOfText>
<human> what part <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was ready to eat at that buffet we went to last night <endOfText>
<human> I love seafood buffets <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My job got me the best present the other day when they celebrated my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a flat image of Darth Vader, where he was drawn with lights that change color. <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool and thoughtful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice! <endOfText>
<human> It was a flat image of Darth Vader, where he was drawn with lights that change color.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was at a restaurant and when I got my food it had a hair in it! I was so looking forward to eating it and WHAM! A big 'ol hair!!! <endOfText>
<human> yuk.. did you pull it out and continue to eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> NO! I sent it back and ordered something else! <endOfText>
<human> smart move <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a bonus at work that I wasn't expecting! <endOfText>
<human> How big was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate scary movies, they scare me so much, especially jumpscares <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, I can't take scary movies of any kind.  I used to watch some of them when I was in my 20's.  What kind of movies do you like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my favorite things to do is cook, and I recently moved into a new apartment by myself. I'm gonna say cooking for yourself isn't really as fun as cooking for a group. <endOfText>
<human> Not at all. It is kind of boring being left to clean everything alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got us concert tickets to a sold out show. He told me he couldn't get them. I cant believe he kept that a secret until now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that's awesome! What concert were the tickets for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a guy pulled out in front of me, almost caused a dang wreck <endOfText>
<human> I hate that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a restaurant yesterday for dinner and it was pretty good. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Did you know the restaurant before going there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am moving to new appartment. The new neighborhood is so nice. I am so happy that I found this appartment. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, congratulations on the new place.  Is it somewhere you have wanted to move for a while now?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great, congratulations on the new place.  Is it somewhere you have wanted to move for a while now? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I wanted a swimming pool and a gym in the building. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when  i didnt get the day off <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Why was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a routine that gets me really excited and ready for work in the morning. I'm always so productive at work because of it! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome that it works for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah having a good routine is a good way to put you in the right mood to work. <endOfText>
<human> yea i can see that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I wore a bathing suit and felt more confident then I have in a long time. <endOfText>
<human> That's really good! Did you lose weight, or have you just not felt comfortable with yourself before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is supposed to come over next week, but due to weather she may not come until later. I really miss her so I hope she visits soon. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that stinks. Does she live far away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is going to college in a couple of days and I'm sure the house will be a lot quieter without him.. I think the empty nest feeling is inevitable <endOfText>
<human> That is sad. Do you have other children? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rented a house on the beach this summer. It was so dirty that I couldn't stay. There were cockroachs everywhere. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Did you get your money back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 14 year old daughter applied for an internship all m herself for over the summer <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is impressive, I could not do that at that age <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am envious of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> Why its okay to be differnt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in an antique store and found a really old coin for cheap. It was real and its very valuable. I'm so happy! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I don't think I will sell it though. It's got a good backstory. <endOfText>
<human> yea that sounds like a plan <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hate when my kids take my things without asking <endOfText>
<human> I feel you!  My two kids know all the rules and yet, they just go out the window when they want to take something or use something that isn't theirs.  I always joke that you can't have nice things with kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow is my 14th year anniversary married to my wonderful husband. I can't believe it was that long ago. What a wonderful day. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Are you having a party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping the Eagles can win it all again this season! <endOfText>
<human> That game was fun to watch last year. Do you live in Philadelphia? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when my parents got me a car for graduation <endOfText>
<human> No one has ever given me a car. That must be nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't beleive my kids ruined my house so quickly. <endOfText>
<human> What did they do to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe I hit reply all instead of reply when sending an email. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, this is a classic office disaster story. How bad was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I interned for a Physical Education class for third graders. I haven't been a third grader for a long time, so I was surprised how intelligent they are! They go through a lot of stuff, too. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome.  I barely remember 3rd grade.  I think we just played games and had fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking with my brother and he lied to me. I'm so gullible though it takes me awhile to realize it. <endOfText>
<human> What did he say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He told me that he got a big bonus from work. I found out from my mom though that he lost his job instead. <endOfText>
<human> Why would he even do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend is getting married soon. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope their marriage goes well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started a business. <endOfText>
<human> Cool! What kind of business? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just quit her job to start her own private practice. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome.  Is she a doctor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really looking forward to tomorrow night! <endOfText>
<human> Really? What you got going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend just broke up with me. My coworkers had donuts sitting on my desk this morning to cheer me up. I never thought they would do something like that. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that was nice of them!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea and they must have got to work early because I am usually there before them. <endOfText>
<human> lol.  Maybe they all came into work early just to surprise you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my neices and nephews so much <endOfText>
<human> That is great, do you get to see them much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is next month and my wife has a surprise planned. <endOfText>
<human> That doesnt sounds like a surprise <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am seeing a lot of litter on the ground these days around my school... really chaps me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that is pretty upsetting. I don't get what is so hard about throwing away your trash.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah that is pretty upsetting. I don't get what is so hard about throwing away your trash. <endOfText>
<human> I know, right? People are just so lazy or don't care I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching TV and stopped on the Discover channel. There was this really gross show on bugs, but I couldn't help but watch. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah those shows can fascinating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I don't really know. It was really really gross. <endOfText>
<human> It's true, but I also can't help but watch. It's exciting to learn in any case. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into my garage the other day and there was a new car in there. <endOfText>
<human> Who's car was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoyed the Broadway show Hamilton. I didn't think I would. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing that you got tickets.  What was your favorite part? <endOfText>

<human> Those movies are amazing.  I loved the last one with Thanos.  He was a cool character. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave my parents behind in the country I grew up in. I haven't seen them in 12 years and I cry a lot thinking about them <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. What country is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a little sad my youngest son is starting Kindergarten in a few days. <endOfText>
<human> Awww I completely understand. I remember that feeling. And mine is now a senior. Time flies! Cherish every moment with him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man on the street and he looked so sad. He had no one and I kept on walking by to leave him alone. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so sad.  I hope he was ok <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes things really arent fair.  I wanted to steal from my cousin <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I saw a guy scratching his behind on the train this morning. <endOfText>
<human> That is weird. Did you say anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched the scariest movie on TV last night. It gave me the creeps and I couldn't sleep I was so terrified! <endOfText>
<human> What movie? I can't watch scary movies anymore since having kids, they are too realistic now haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work, and one of my friends had to go. I was so mad, because that meant I had to do all the work! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Extra workload is terrible!  Did you make it through? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband says he stopped drinking but I'm reluctant to believe him <endOfText>
<human> That's kind of sad.  What makes you reluctant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy at work just went and bought a really nice boat. <endOfText>
<human> Man, I wish I had the money to afford a boat, I don't know about you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm being induced on Monday because I'll be at 41 weeks pregnant by then. This is my first baby and I'm so scared! Labor seems impossible! <endOfText>
<human> You got this girl! I was induced when I had my daughter a year ago! I was scared too but honestly don't remember much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my favorite restaurant and the owner gave me a complimentary meal because I eat there so often! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What kind of restaurant is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's a mexican restaurant <endOfText>
<human> Oh those are great and a lot of times they make everything fresh! What is your favorite meal there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a third trip to the grocery store hoping to find good clearance items this week like I normally do. <endOfText>
<human> Did you find any? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a restaurant and the waiter didn't serve us at all! She was so lazy! I was so dissapointed. <endOfText>
<human> That's super frustrating! Did you walk out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our dining room is just a few steps down from the kitchen, so I made me a bowl of ravioli and fell down the 3 steps somehow. I got ravioli all over me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't find my phone all day, but when I finally did, I hadn't missed a single call or text. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, where was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my wife is amazing, shes the only one i want <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you lucked out, make sure she knows how special she is :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't happy today when someone ran in to the back of my moms car. <endOfText>
<human> That makes a lot of sense. I wouldn't be happy either! I hope that they have good insurance <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, they put a huge crushed in dent in the back corner. They didn't get his plates on the camera :( And it's like $500 to pay the deductible to get it fixed..Seriously- insurance companies suck! <endOfText>
<human> Man that really does stink! Hopefully the police will find some way to catch the guy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been practicing magic since I was a kid. I'm really good at it and I'm going to be the next David Copperfield. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of tricks can you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well I can do a lot of card tricks, but I'm also good at slight of hand and bigger illusions as well. <endOfText>
<human> Thats pretty cool! I am fascinated by that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy called me the other day and had me come over to help him lift something. <endOfText>
<human> Does he have a bad back or was it just an enormous thing?  Did you get to go over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my kids were young and once fall came, we'd go to a pumpkin patch festival for a weekend. Those were sweet days! <endOfText>
<human> Those have got to be some good memories for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't wait until tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Whats happening tomorrow? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the grocery store the other day, and when I was walking through the isle and some kid brushed past me and almost knocked me over! I was so mad <endOfText>
<human> Kids can be so annoying sometimes.  I hate those shoes with wheels that they have.  so annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the fair the other day.  It was really fun until my friends made me go on rides <endOfText>
<human> What rides did you go on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sat home all day by myself yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Sounds relaxing, being a mom I could use a day like that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds relaxing, being a mom I could use a day like that! <endOfText>
<human> lol.  I don't have any kids to keep me busy.  I just sat there playing video games and doing laundry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my favorite restaurant and I found a hair in my food! This never happened before so I was obviously very angry. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty gross. It happens though. Did they comp you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, they gave me a whole new plate and it was free! <endOfText>
<human> Great! They should get a great review as we all have hair everywhere. It's bound to happen at  some point. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tonight I feel wound up a bit. I am tired of being sick. I have tried so many things <endOfText>
<human> How long have you been sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son hit a home run at little league tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Wow!  Impressive!  He must be beaming and you must be so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 3 year old got into some oil that I had sitting down on the counter just for one minute. He dumped it all over the couch and living room floor. It took everything I had not to explode. <endOfText>
<human> I'm impressed you didn't explode!  My wife would've gone insane.  She hates that kind of stuff.  How long did it take to clean up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a restaurant where they cook in front of you and it was very cool! I had some teriyaki chicken <endOfText>
<human> oh those places are fun.  Its like dinner and a show..  Was it expensive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait until next week.  I think I am going to start packing soon <endOfText>
<human> Are you moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a fly in my house and I can't catch it! I really hate flies <endOfText>
<human> They are really bad especially if you have pets. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad brought me some guacamole he made. <endOfText>
<human> Was it good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For the first time, my son went to the doctor without crying. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must be proud! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About 6 years ago a really bad storm rolled through my city and a tornado almost hit us. I was really scared <endOfText>
<human> how did it turn out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just told me today that my vasectomy failed, if you know what I mean. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy!  Congratulations are in order then?!!  How many kids do you have then?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh boy!  Congratulations are in order then?!!  How many kids do you have then? <endOfText>
<human> We aren't quite to the excited phase yet, but thank you.  I'm sure when the shock wears off we will be over the moon about it.  We have 2 and one (or more) on the way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked all day and came home to the whole house a wreck. My husband had the whole month off and he didn't clean one bit of the house or make dinner. <endOfText>
<human> I would be disappointed in him if I were you.  He sounds like a real low life.  Maybe you should kick that bum to the curb. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son is so awesome! i am lucky to be his dad <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the grocery store and there was a HUGE sale on oreos! They were $1.5! <endOfText>
<human> sheesh thats a great deal!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sheesh thats a great deal! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah! Considering that they are $2.50 or $3 normally <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My nephew starts the 10th grade this year <endOfText>
<human> 10th grade was a good year.  I met my favorite girlfriend that year.  Is he excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I so excited for this weekend. I'm really optomistic that it's going to be a relaxing break from work! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Will you be relaxing at home or elsewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a new water park about to open near me. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Are you going to go see it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just moved our family into a new house and finally finished unpacking, are all settled, and getting into a schedule again. I'm so happy and love being able to relax. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds nice! Do you enjoy your new home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes!  Its only a tad bigger than our last place but its set up so much better. The space is used so much better. <endOfText>
<human> That makes a big difference. Getting your feng shui on the go! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bet me $20 in a swimming race across a lake last weekend. I took the deal because I am positive I'm a stronger swimmer! <endOfText>
<human> $20 bucks?  I'd try to do it too.  How'd it go?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is entering a local battle of the bands contest. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I couldn't make to dinner on time with my friends <endOfText>
<human> aww im sorry.  did they leave without you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared. I was walking to my car and I thought I was going to be robbed. <endOfText>
<human> That is so scary, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling anxious about the birth of my son in December. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh Congratulations!  I am sure you will be ok.  Is it your first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to work with some serious bedhead. I went to the bathroom after being there for a few hours I saw how awful I looked! I <endOfText>
<human> did anyone see ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nope no one told me. It was so upsetting and I just looked terrible. <endOfText>
<human> oh well you lived through it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No matter what I've done, my mom has always been supportive. <endOfText>
<human> That's what mom's do! I think it's in our blood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is going so great right now! <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend went to work in a new country on her own without anyone. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, must've been scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the grocery store and I saw some guy carrying like 40 bags, he must've been very strong <endOfText>
<human> That's crazy! I wonder if he's stocking up or is cooking for a lot of people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met my friends girlfriend and he is so lucky. She's funny and beautiful. The whole package. <endOfText>

<human> nah this is a bearded dragon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I spent more time with my dog while she was still with me <endOfText>
<human> Did she pass away, or did something else happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my dealership and I had to hand over my car to some stranger. I was kinda scared that he'd take something, but I had to trust him <endOfText>
<human> I don't really trust dealerships. What's wrong with your car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing was wrong with it, it just needed an oil change. <endOfText>
<human> Ah you're getting maintenance done. That's good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a girl propose to her boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting and different. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion that I worked so hard. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Do you know who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate that people these days are so crappy to others <endOfText>
<human> Me too, people can be so cruel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our home was broken into and it was so scary. <endOfText>
<human> that is scary! it happened to me as well so i bought a couple of guns <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few months ago I broke my wrist. I had so much family support, it made me very happy. <endOfText>
<human> It's always nice to have people around you that care about you. They make hard times much easier. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife told me she's ready for kids, but I'm not sure if I am. I'm not totally against the idea, I'm just a little nervous about making such a big decision right now. <endOfText>
<human> Well take it from me, I have one and twins on the way.... Never wanted kids either but once theyre here it's an amazing feeling! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sunday i am going to a concert and i cant wait <endOfText>
<human> So exciting, which concert? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will win my chess game. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! Chess is such an interesting game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been the greatest person, but my family always sticks by me. <endOfText>
<human> That must be nice, having a good family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The skating rink I used to go to as a child is being replaced by a hotel <endOfText>
<human> That is kind of sad. I hate it when places from your childhood close or are torn down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a beautiful gold watch from the Shopping Channel. When I received it, it looked completely different and was total junk. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens, especially when you have something else pictured. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave my son for the first time to go to work and it was so hard. <endOfText>
<human> I can't imagine. How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was shocked when i saw i was given the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> That is a nice surprise! Do you usually work every weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is turning two in a few months and it has me looking back to when he was first born. <endOfText>
<human> yea they grow up way too fast <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the concert i am going to on sunday is going to be awesome! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome! What band? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to a new town for work. It pays a lot more, but I'm going to be by myself. <endOfText>
<human> ah that sucks! what city? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last ramen. <endOfText>
<human> uh oh.. late trip to the local walmart to get more! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i couldnt leave work on time <endOfText>

<human> Eww, thats gross! Poor kid needs to learn some manners! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first child is due in a couple of months, and I am a little nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I think everyone gets nervous. You'll be fine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone keeps calling my phone. I'll block them, but they just call from a new number. <endOfText>
<human> That is annoying. Do they say anything when you answer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is turning two in a few months and it makes me a little sad. <endOfText>
<human> whats his name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im going to a concert on sunday, im sure it will rock <endOfText>
<human> Who are you going to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every day I stop and think about how some people have very hard lives and it makes me both sad and also thankful that I had a caring and supportive family growing up. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice to hear someone thinking about others. Many people who luck out don't care what happens to others or are grateful for their lot in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for Fall. This summer heat is killing me. <endOfText>
<human> Tell me about it. It's over 100 almost every day here and it's so humid it makes the air feel sticky! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new Mexican place is going to be so good! <endOfText>
<human> i love Mexican food! salsa is the best <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> im going to a concert sunday and its going to be amazing <endOfText>
<human> You must be excited! Will it go on the whole day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been practicing this piece for months. I think I'm ready to play it in front of everyone. <endOfText>
<human> what are you playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was caught off guard when i was toold i could go home early <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes that is good and sometimes it is bad. Depends on how bad you need the money. I hope it was a good thing for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are really wanting to buy a new house. We are hoping it will happen in the next year. <endOfText>

<human> You go for it!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You go for it! <endOfText>
<human> I think I have a pretty good chance. She seems like she's been into me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for my husband! <endOfText>
<human> Why? What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled soda on my laptop. <endOfText>
<human> oh no!!! Did you put it in rice?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no!!! Did you put it in rice? <endOfText>
<human> Oh I can put a whole laptop in rice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a new Korean restaurant that's opening up. <endOfText>
<human> i have never tried korean food , and i love trying different kinds of food i would be so excited  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have never tried korean food , and i love trying different kinds of food i would be so excited <endOfText>

<human> Oh god, I've done many things but that is actually one I have not done. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was on a rush to work lol , thats what i get for partying all night <endOfText>
<human> Hey, the party was probably worth it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're getting a new coworker next week. We've been so short staffed. <endOfText>
<human> that always stinks, i hate being short handed  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that always stinks, i hate being short handed <endOfText>
<human> We might finally get to home on time next week. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope im going to get to go fishing this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Fishing is truly fun. We occasionally go with my friends too. Do you go frequently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This week again I forgot to call lawn mowers again. The grass is now high and my residential administration has already sent me a warning notice <endOfText>
<human> you ever cut it yourself ? or is it too big of a yard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our home was broken into and it was such a terrible experience. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful, I hope no one in your family was hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we are going to a concert sunday, i am sure its going to be great <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! Who are you going to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just found out that my grandmother is having an affair with a younger man. <endOfText>
<human> whoa thats shocking! how old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I caved and ordered online grocery. <endOfText>
<human> we always do that, its so convenient  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we always do that, its so convenient <endOfText>

<human> You're gonna be tired the next day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally getting this leg brace off next week. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, how long was it on for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't felt this happy and relaxed in a long time. Loving life! My kids are both married and live on their own, I recently paid off my house and I'm retired! <endOfText>
<human> Yea. After all that, I think it's definitely time for you to relax and have fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered take out and got a whole lot of food for $5 <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's a good deal!  Where was this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad about the other night <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous. I have a big presentation coming up at work. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you'll do fine if you practice enough! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am going to a show this weekend, i expect it to be awesome <endOfText>
<human> What show is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know who keeps double parking at my workplace. <endOfText>
<human> that is the worst, i hate when people cant park <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is participating in the badminton junior level held between states. <endOfText>
<human> that sounds cool.. how long has he been competing ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wonder what my friend is doing now on the side of the world <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, me too! Is your friend working abroad too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I see these bug guys at the gym lifting heavy weights and think they're cool with their big muscles. I don't know what girls see in them. <endOfText>
<human> Everyone has their preference. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I guess so. I wish they would look at me that way. <endOfText>
<human> Aw no luck with the ladies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for tomorrow night! <endOfText>
<human> whats tomorrow night? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother got to see one of my favorite bands i wish i could have went <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's good for him though!  Who was the band? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When ever i drive around 3 pm or 4 , or even at 7 am , my anxiety goes through the roof crazy traffic i honestly would not drive if i did not have too <endOfText>
<human> Is it the traffic or driving that gives you anxiety? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> both , when im with my brother and hes typing on his phone and not looking at the road i start hyper ventilating <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh. That's not safe at all.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm retiring soon. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome , one day i want to make it to retirement im happy to hear people work this long, in my area young people refuse to work all they do is party and live off there familys money <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i think the chargers will be very good this year. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a football team?  I'm sorry, I'm not a sports fan.  Are they your favorite team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't had an actual birthday party since I turned 18, I never really thought much about it though. <endOfText>
<human> its sad once you get older those things dissapear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i wasnt able to go to vegas as planned <endOfText>
<human> What got in the way of your plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know how but I fell off in between the aisles at Walmart when doing grocery shopping. Everybody was looking at me like I was some kind of alien <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did anyone help you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could have sworn I saw a snake in my backyard but I haven't seen it again <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible. Do you live in a city or rural areas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got yelled at by my boss last week for being late even though it was because my tire blew out on my way to work. <endOfText>
<human> bosses can be such aholes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sat home all day by myself yesterday <endOfText>
<human> You must have felt very lonely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my bro saw one of my favorite bands the other day! <endOfText>
<human> what did he tell you ? did he like them as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few days ago my brothers house got broken into they took everything he had, and on top of that they started breaking the walls for no reason , i was furious <endOfText>
<human> thats a shame! did he get any of it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> he got everything back we found out who took it , we called the cops and they did not even arrest the lady since she allowed my brother to get his stuff, back she denied any involvement and the cops said she was cooperating <endOfText>
<human> thats good, my house was also broken in to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Over the past year, I gained a ton of weight and never realized until it was too late. I feel like I really let myself down. I always said I'd never let myself go. <endOfText>
<human> Hey, It's never too late. Unless you can't exercise at all there is always a way to start.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, It's never too late. Unless you can't exercise at all there is always a way to start. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I guess you're right. I need to stop pouting about it and get in the gym. I'm definitely going to have to keep an eye on my calories now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been going to a new school for weeks and still don't know anyone. I always eat my lunch by myself. <endOfText>
<human> It's not good to be stuck alone. I'm sure you can make friends with someone there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion at work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  How are you handling the disappointment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest daughter will graduate  high school this year. <endOfText>
<human> That is a big moment. Are you a little sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's an understatement.  I'm having to go through lots of old photos, like when she was a baby, toddler, etc.. to put together the slide show for her graduation ceremony. <endOfText>
<human> I would be a mess, my son is about to turn two and I am sad about that. Time goes by so fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to buy a new gaming system online for Black Friday last year but when I went to buy it I discovered it was all sold out! <endOfText>
<human> what were you going to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the braves have a shot this year! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? How much of a chance do you think they have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the braves i think will make a run this year <endOfText>
<human> Who knows, they always choke. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> they do unfortunately <endOfText>
<human> Maybe this year will be their year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the big promotion I had hoped for at work. <endOfText>
<human> that stinks! hopefully you will get one soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is talking so loud on his headset playing video games. Ugh <endOfText>
<human> lol.  Put some headphones on yourself and tune him out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I've had such an awesome week!  How about you? <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Mine has been just fine, not bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> keep finding dog poops in my yard. <endOfText>
<human> Do you even have a dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it feels good the braves are finally relevant again <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, they seem to be doing good this year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old baby blanket the other day when I was cleaning my closet out. <endOfText>
<human> that is so awesome! are you going to pass it down to a family member <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the chargers are going to be great this year! <endOfText>
<human> You think so?    <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You think so? <endOfText>
<human> i do, they have a great roster! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I was stoked when I checked the mail yesterday <endOfText>
<human> what did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son took his first steps this week <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I guess he might be one year old. Am I right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning to buy new pet. I've 2 already. <endOfText>
<human> What kind are you looking to get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> people in my hood getting robbed everywhere , crack heads every where im finally making enough money to leave this place , and i wont miss it <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you are getting to leave. I hope you find somewhere safe.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> been working really hard lately , im just gonna miss all my hood friends but ill keep in contact <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a plan. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am glad you are getting to leave. I hope you find somewhere safe. <endOfText>
<human> been working really hard lately , im just gonna miss all my hood friends but ill keep in contact  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having my first child and I am anxious about it. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome i would feel the same way , i want to be a father one day i am really happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday when I was riding the bus home after work, the guy I sat next to started to dig in his nose and flick his boogers at the window. Everyone was staring at him and he didn't care. <endOfText>
<human> lol dude is living the life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im going to a show on sunday, i cant wait <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What kind of show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After saving for several month and cutting on spending, I have now saved enough to buy an iPhone X without any debt or credit <endOfText>
<human> Good, credit and debt are bad things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The soccer ball of my neighbor kids keep landing in my yard. It is very frequent. <endOfText>
<human> Take the knife and destroy it the next time it lands. That way they will learn a valuable lesson <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting ready for graduate school and I think I got everything I need finally. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's amazing!!  What did you major in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Taking my nephew to a show tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> What show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law drives me crazy! <endOfText>
<human> oh no what does she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> if the braves dont win it all this year im going to be bummed <endOfText>
<human> Are they doing good so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our home was broken into <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did they steal a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow, I am taking my driving test. I feel ready. I have taken a lot of driving lessens. <endOfText>
<human> are you confident you will pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sittiing at a traffic light and I was hit from the side by car. Instead of staying, the driver just drove off. I'm so upset! <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you, that is so scary! I am glad you are okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the best friends, they put together a party for my graduation and I had no idea it was even planned. <endOfText>
<human> That's really awesome. Your friends sound really great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister came to stay with us when we had our first child. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it was nice to have extra help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i get payed i usually go to my go to restaurant places , i avoid fast food since they always get my orders wrong, so when new restaurants open i tend to avoid them until i see good reviews <endOfText>
<human> Yeah the new places are always really busy when they first open too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wait for a few months , but eventually go <endOfText>
<human> Yeah same here <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Getting my bags packed and ready to go! <endOfText>
<human> where you going ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the time when we were using public phones to call each other when we were outside home. <endOfText>
<human> I know, right. I miss seeing the phone booths everywhere.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know, right. I miss seeing the phone booths everywhere. <endOfText>
<human> I miss also seeing the yellow book wirh all the phone numbers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work at an animal shelter and it's such rewarding job. It feel so good to be taking care of the animals there. <endOfText>
<human> My daughter is thinking about that career track.  Is it hard though when an animal doesn't make it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it really is, but we try our best if that is likely to minimize the pain. <endOfText>
<human> That would be the only thing that would keep me from it.  I admire those that care for our animals, so thanks to you for being you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am sure the braves are going to contend this year <endOfText>
<human> I don't know much about baseball but I went to a Braves game a few weeks ago and it was fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A motorist ride his bike at a extreme speed without any control over it. <endOfText>
<human> that is scary to me, i hate bikes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the braves had no love, now they are killing it <endOfText>
<human> Why are you saying like this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom's birthday was 2 days ago <endOfText>
<human> Did you guys have a nice celebration? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a really good friend that is just the sweetest person. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is the best. It's so nice to have a great friend.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that is the best. It's so nice to have a great friend. <endOfText>
<human> She really is, but she lives in basically a mansion - so that's hard sometimes - I get a bit embarrassed when she comes over to our house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever my walk with my friend, I get so frustated. He walks so slow it takes forever to get anywhere. <endOfText>
<human> I am the same lol I walk fast. Too fast sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I've been told that I walk as fast a some people run. <endOfText>
<human> LOL you get there faster <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How interesting <endOfText>
<human> I had to eat dinner alone today. Husband is on his way back from a work trip <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My students have a big test coming up to see if they can move to the next grade. I think they'll do great! I made sure they were well prepared. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful that you are looking out for them like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bunch of my friends met up for dinner recently (I just found out), but I wasn't invited. Not happy about that at all. <endOfText>
<human> Those don't sound like friends. I'd be extremely pissed off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have a digital mammogram and ultrasound earlier this year. <endOfText>
<human> What were they looking for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when my long time girl friend left me , i felt so alone even tho i have family and friends around me i just was not there i lost a lot of weight too <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. That's a pretty common response to break ups. A lot of people go through it, so you're not alone! I hope you pull through soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thank you for your honest response , and i did get over it , just took a few months <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! I'm sure you'll find someone better soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a watch from eBay that said "9/10 cosmetic" condition, yet when I took it out of the box, there was a huge crack on the watch face! Does that really count as 9/10?! <endOfText>
<human> hell no it does not , these people out here stealing that is exactly why im afraid of buying from e bay , a lot of bad reviews  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hell no it does not , these people out here stealing that is exactly why im afraid of buying from e bay , a lot of bad reviews <endOfText>
<human> I had to calm myself down before messaging the seller! It could be that it got damaged in shipping, but who knows. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having a baby next week... I think I am ready! <endOfText>
<human> Oh congratulations! That's wonderful news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to a seafood buffet with the fiancee tonight and pretty stoked about it. It's the simple things in life... haha <endOfText>
<human> Yum I love buffets! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend hasn't been paying much attention to me lately. <endOfText>
<human> That is such a bummer have you spoken to him about this issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I have been married 22 years now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is great! Were you High School sweethearts? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend has the most gorgeous long red hair. <endOfText>
<human> Oh. I love red hairs. I have always admired their unique genetic characteristic that sets apart from others <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a very fierce argument with my partner last night. She left the house in the middle of the night and I am not sure if she will ever come back <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Have you spoken to her at all since she left? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking at pictures of my daughter when she was born... crazy how time flies <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is. It's like you turn around and 10 years has gone by.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is. It's like you turn around and 10 years has gone by. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes I wish I could go back in time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took a lot of work and a whole lot of training, but last week I managed to place second place in a bodybuilding show I competed in! <endOfText>
<human> That's incredible! You must feel on top of the world! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It feels pretty great! It's not first place, but hey, it's my first show. I'll get it next time. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure all the hard work and effort you put in to it really shows. I am trying to get in shape myself, and your story is inspiring! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep heading a noises coming from my attic <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh!!!  Better go investigate! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lol operation "Scared Nutless" is in action. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was really looking forward to going to a picnic I had planned on Sunday, but it is gonna rain... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Maybe you can plan to enjoy a picnic the following weekend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in middle school, some mean girls played a really nasty trick on me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope it wasn't something that caused you real distress.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I hope it wasn't something that caused you real distress. <endOfText>
<human> It actually was.  They pretended that I had a secret admirer, sending me notes and putting stuff in my locker.  I was mortified when they admitted it was them in front of the whole class. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a random package in the mail today... it was a late birthday gift! <endOfText>
<human> Nothing like mail to brighten up your day! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad had been stationed overseas for over a year and and wasn't expected back for 3 months. <endOfText>
<human> Did he arrive back early? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog, which I had for about 15 years passed away last week. I miss her so much. My home feels empty without her around. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. I am sorry. Losing a pet is so hard. They are family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother in law cannot mind her own business. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! You got one of the bad ones. They sure makes things hard.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yikes! You got one of the bad ones. They sure makes things hard. <endOfText>
<human> She really does - she is always trying to bend my husbands' ear to her way of thinking we should do things - with our house, our kids, etc.. and she never listens when he tells her that's enough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty peeved since my boss just called me to come in and do something at work on my day off. <endOfText>
<human> ugh I hate when that happens... when I worked in retail my boss always called me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We tried for a long time to get pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> Did you?  How did that work out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to go buy me some new beach clothes <endOfText>
<human> OO are you going to the beach soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love calisthenics , recently i moved up my push ups to a total of 1000 and astonished at what the body is capable <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is awesome! How long does that take? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> about 1 hour and a half , but i do other exercises like dips , pull ups , and curls with elastic bands <endOfText>
<human> That is really great! Your fitness and health are very important to take care of. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to surprise my mother this weekend for her birthday with a gift. <endOfText>
<human> what you planning on giving her ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> do you watch cricket? I hope Australia will win the world cup <endOfText>
<human> No, I don't. What are the teams playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite bracelet... but after looking for a few hours I found it <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear you found it I know your heart was racing to find it especially if it was your favorite.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Glad to hear you found it I know your heart was racing to find it especially if it was your favorite. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it meant a lot to me... glad i didn't lose it forever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go in for an MRI scan due to some headaches that the dr couldn't get figured out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I hope they will be able to find out soon what is causing them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. I hope they will be able to find out soon what is causing them. <endOfText>
<human> Well the MRI was clear but my mother has MS and it can be diagnosed with an MRI - so it was a bit nerve wracking to say the least. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really proud of my coworker and their presentation at work recently. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. It's good to be supportive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby said MAMA for the first time..... I couldn't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> Awe, how cute! That is such a blessed moment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey stranger!  I was cleaning up my attic yesterday and guess what I found??? <endOfText>
<human> What could you have found in that dark, dusty place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like a blast. Wish I could be there! <endOfText>
<human> You're more than welcome to join in some Mario action! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband told me last year that he wanted a divorce. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that how did things turn out did you two make it work or going through the process now?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that how did things turn out did you two make it work or going through the process now? <endOfText>
<human> Well, he didn't have a real reason honestly - just said he wasn't happy.  But it's a  year later and he's still here so - LOL! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally found out what was making the noise in my attic <endOfText>

<human> That's what I like to hear. What do you do for a living? <endOfText>

<human> Ah, the good ole side hustle. I like that. You should check out "Side Hustle" by Chris Guillebeau. I'm looking to start something myself.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have lent some money to one of my friends friend who was in need. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice, did you ever get the moneyback? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I had to take care of my sick brother who had the flu, during this time I had to watch over him and make sure he was taking his medicine and take his temperature constantly <endOfText>
<human> ah, thats being a good brother. Is your brother alright now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I entered a raffle at work. I'm crossing my fingers I win! <endOfText>
<human> Wow - what is the raffle for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really sad and was emotional over hearing my friend's dog passed away. <endOfText>
<human> every time a loved one dies its never good news , even if its a pet  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> every time a loved one dies its never good news , even if its a pet <endOfText>
<human> Yes, he was a really good dog and was always friendly with everyone he met. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i remember the first time a benched 225 , i was so happy and i weighed 140 lbs !!! <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that is really impressive! How much do you bench now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last piece of cake which was supposed to be for my husband... oops! <endOfText>
<human> oh! that's really fabulous <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle passed away a couple of month ago and he left behind a 3 year old daughter. I was so sad for her. She does not realize yet what she lost <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is heartbreaking.  How is she and her mother holding up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent time today folding up all of my daughter's dance shirts from the time she was 2 years old. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very nostalgic. How old is she now?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds very nostalgic. How old is she now? <endOfText>
<human> She will be 16 next month - time flies doesn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it always makes me a little angry or a little down , when i see young people begging for money on facebook groups ... like dude get a job <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, i feel some are just picky on what job they want to have <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> just get a job , does it even matter grow up and contribute <endOfText>
<human> I agree with you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to stay late at work today and missed family dinner <endOfText>
<human> i have to stay late at work all the time , im sorry to hear that  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have to stay late at work all the time , im sorry to hear that <endOfText>

<human> Hey that's awesome!  Where are you going for vacation?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a parking spot at my job, but I don't have a car. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you can park a bicycle or skateboard there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter started kindergarten today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That is great. Did she have a good day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won $20 on a scratch off! I couldn't believe it <endOfText>
<human> thats good , was it a 1.00 scratch off ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes that was the best park <endOfText>
<human> i would be happy too , but i would probably buy 20 tickets after and lose in every single one with my luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> does it bother you , when you are single and all your friends are in relationships and happy , its kind of annoying lol <endOfText>
<human> YEs because they never want to hang out unless they bring their partner lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a job interview coming up <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! I hope you do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss when my daughter was a baby... I feel like it's all a ablur now <endOfText>
<human> I bet you had some good times when she was a baby!  How old is she now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a bit sad since my wife left for a trip this weekend. My dog is keeping me company. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, maybe you can hang out with some friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry on my son. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Today I saw the world's biggest cockroach <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is gross, did you kill it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling very stressed because I have a package being delivered express, but the tracking has been all wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Such things are very rare if you use services from reputable delivering companies. What carrier did you use for your delivery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When in traffic yesterday, i got a hit from behind by a Toyota Camry car. Even though it was a gentle touch, it left scratches. So disgusted at the driver <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you get a police report and exchange information? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's finally the weekend, woohooo! <endOfText>
<human> That is definitely something to celebrate! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I an so tired of competing for my boyfriend's attention. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's a horrible feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for next month <endOfText>

<human> Yeah it's his first time seeing a beach too!  So thrilled! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a new job and my interview went great! <endOfText>
<human> That is great news. What job was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my job search to being. <endOfText>

<human> Whoa, were you in a hurry? Did something happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Were leaving on vacation tomorrow, I think we have everything ready <endOfText>
<human> Well, that will be great! Where are y'all going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really don't like it when people talk during a movie. <endOfText>
<human> Right. What is the purpose of going to movies if people talk there. Uninformed people everywhere <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just gotten myself a new smartphone and guess what. My partner drops it smashing into ground and now there is whole crack line on the screen <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to get it fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle died last year in may <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. It's very hard to lose a loved one, I know from personal experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I expected a good hike this year, but i didnt get it <endOfText>
<human> Awe shucks, what stopped you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched the first season of one of my favorite childhood shows in only two days just recently. <endOfText>
<human> oh well, whats the show. i know for sure you would have enjoyed it again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle died last year in april <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible news. How did he die? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really nervous for my swimming test next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? I can imagine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad that my friend is in a relationship and I secretly hope it doesn't go well. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well that doesn't sound good. But, maybe you have good reasons? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son really wanted me to play a video game with him tonight, but I kept on asking him to wait a little longer so I could finish up some work. He ended up falling asleep. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, how did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband randomly got me a laptop,,,, I wasnt expecting that! <endOfText>
<human> Well that's very sweet of him!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well that's very sweet of him! <endOfText>
<human> Yes it made me so happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked the Falcons didn't score tonight vs the Jets. <endOfText>
<human> oh i didnt get a chance to see the game <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone cut me off in traffic today <endOfText>
<human> What did you do after they cut you off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving other day. One of the driver in front used the blinker for left and took a right. I was so damn irritated!! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so annoying to deal with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sucks that summer is almost over for me. <endOfText>
<human> ah that bad!!. You need again to wait for ages!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I won the poker game. <endOfText>
<human> wow good for you man <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt know anyone my first year of uni <endOfText>
<human> Did you make friends eventually? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish they would bring back 8 tracks. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not sure I've ever used them. I think my earliest music media was cassettes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last piece of cake. It was for my sister's birthday she didn't even get a piece. <endOfText>
<human> How did your sister react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's alright. She's family, so she will still love you. Just learn from this mistake. <endOfText>
<human> I will. Having siblings you always fight and make up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't leave bed for three weeks. I was so alone. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met this girl from Tinder one time and it went so badly haha. <endOfText>
<human> What went wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As you may know, our country is experience a very deep racial division and tension in the recent years. I am hopeful that we will get over it sooner or later <endOfText>
<human> With Trump in the presidency, it won't end soon.You can bet on that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not proud of myself lately. <endOfText>
<human> So you consider yourself total loser in life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i stubbed my toe the other day <endOfText>
<human> Did it hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was speeding but didn't get caught. I feel bad thou. <endOfText>
<human> yea thats fair, ive done the same thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I waited all night on the day that Halo 3 came out. I was so excited. <endOfText>
<human> that was my favorite game ever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend dropped his phone but dived and caught it <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty good reflexes on his part. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really get scared when I have to talk to people in public. <endOfText>
<human> Same! That is why I never go outside and just be on my computer all day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have booked a cruise ride for me and the wife. I have bad intuition something going to happen <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you shouldn't go then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried when my best friend moved away. <endOfText>
<human> ah so sad for you, where did he/she moved? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a teenager very curiouse about sex and i found a picture looking for condoms it was of my dad and nother lady kissing. <endOfText>
<human> I imagine that was a big surprise! Did you ever mention to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a meeting with a potential client, and guess what. I forgot to inform my co-worker about it. Feel bad for being a reason he missed the opportunity <endOfText>
<human> I am sure there will be another chance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do not want to go to school Monday. They will laugh at me. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Is there anything specific that makes you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish summer wasn't ending. <endOfText>
<human> I somewhat disagree. It's been so hot I'll be happy to see the end of summer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend dropped his phone but dived and caught it <endOfText>
<human> Is the phone working? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not looking forward to my surgery. <endOfText>
<human> oh that must be scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for the water parks to open. <endOfText>
<human> I would think they are now. Are they already closed down for the summer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid I will never be a good father. <endOfText>
<human> What makes you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate getting ghosted on Tinder. It happens fairly often. <endOfText>
<human> I never use Tinder due to that reason. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a test in a month from now in calc 3 <endOfText>
<human> Yikes!  Did you study real hard for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew starts 10th grade this year! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still can't believe my mother isn't coming to my wedding. <endOfText>
<human> How come. I can't imagine weddings without the presence of parents. You should convince her to come <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final exam for Statistics class that i took for summer coming in two days. I feel tense and stressed about it <endOfText>
<human> Have you studied? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the Fall Festival. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am so happy I met my wife during college. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, so far I've just had a girlfriend for a week and got laid a few times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No matter how many girls I matched with on Tinder, I never left my girlfriend for a better one. I can't say the same for her, on the other hand. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, you shouldn't even go on Tinder. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really taken back by how good Metallica was in concert. <endOfText>
<human> Really?  I've always wanted to see them!  When did you go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going clothes shopping soon <endOfText>
<human> Where do you shop? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for my first hockey game this winter. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats really cool, good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cut someone off in traffic today <endOfText>
<human> Did you apologize to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt know anyone my first semester of uni <endOfText>
<human> You should go out and meet new people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do not like being around spiders. <endOfText>
<human> yea i agree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied all week for my test and im so ready to take it <endOfText>
<human> When is the test? <endOfText>

<human> Nice association. Do you have any memory attached to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother promised me he would always be there for me. He hasn't let me down yet. <endOfText>
<human> That's so wonderful! I had a very close relationship with my sister too. I always treasured it and loved her so much! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> It sucked when I was in senior year of high school since my brother left for college. <endOfText>
<human> I could imagine. Were you two very close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is getting married next week. Am so happy for her but some where down the heart i feel something heavy <endOfText>
<human> What is the issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really feel bad I didn't refill my mother's car with gas. <endOfText>
<human> ah you used her. You should have filled. But however she will understand <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am good with what kind of car I drive. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a local baking competition and got first place <endOfText>
<human> How many people entered? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is much better at sports than me, <endOfText>
<human> Anything in particular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old yearbook yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Your high school yearbook? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am always afraid a comet with hit the earth. <endOfText>
<human> When do you think it will happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got very annoyed in teh supermarket last week <endOfText>
<human> Oh? What made you so mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I needed a B in calculus to keep the GPA that I needed. <endOfText>
<human> Did you manage to get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I renewed my drivers license I had to take a driving test. I felt that I would pass for sure. <endOfText>
<human> Did you pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day the dog puked on the carpet and when I went to clean it he began to eat it <endOfText>
<human> OMG...how gross. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The sun is shining where I am and I have no plans. I'm fairly happy with that. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's great!  That makes for an awesome day.  It's not quite daylight here yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It seems like every time I go on Tinder and find a good girl, she just finds a better guy and leaves me. <endOfText>
<human> That is kinda sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today in the food court I saw someone drop some french fries on the ground and then picked them up and ate them <endOfText>
<human> Ew, that's pretty gross since the floor is probably dirty as hell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate a whole pack of cookies <endOfText>
<human> LOL, well, they must have been very good then. We all overindulge at times, so don't feel too bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever stub your toe after getting out of the shower? <endOfText>
<human> OH yeah! It's so painful. Did you do that today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah!  Ruined my whole day!  It's like the rest of the day is off kilter because of it! <endOfText>
<human> Things will get better from here on out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an interview next week and I am nervous about it <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you're gonna nail it!   What is the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A week ago I invited everyone to my birthday party and everyone was sure they would come, but on the last minute, they all came up with excuses <endOfText>
<human> Every single one? That's messed up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really needed to get to a test at my school and I needed a ride. I was so happy that he replied and drove me there. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is a good friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worried to go home, since my dad will scold me. <endOfText>
<human> That situation can make you apprehensive. What would be making him upset? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was stopped at a light and when it was my turn to go a car from the other direction ran the light. I wanted to chase them down and give them a piece of my mind. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats bad. you should have really given them your piece of mind. Driving skills of people going down <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My very first date was a complete disaster. <endOfText>
<human> Was it that bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> definitely. <endOfText>
<human> And why was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really happy to hear about this guy that I used to know that was an alcoholic. <endOfText>
<human> Was it good news? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was checking out at the store and the lines were very long. They only had two registers open. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst, especially when you see employees doing nothing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I found my old videogame console, it worked perfectly and I spent the evening playing <endOfText>
<human> Well it would have been nostalgic!!. You would have enjoyed for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I totally thought that I aced this calculus test I took like a year ago. <endOfText>
<human> Did you passed the test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend helped me assemble a surprise party for my sister in record time <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of him! How long did it take? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece was able to ride her new bike without having to use training wheels. She made a big impact on me. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate a whole pack of cookies this morning. <endOfText>
<human> LOL....Been there and done that. Don't feel guilty. What's done is done. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father in law is having a heart surgery next week. I am aiming for best result <endOfText>
<human> Why does he need surgery then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad last semester because I got a C in one of my classes when I was so close to an A <endOfText>
<human> oh feel sorry for you. I just hope you will get it next time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been doing lots of research for a job interview next week <endOfText>
<human> When is the interview? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone ran over my dog the other day and then ran away <endOfText>
<human> Thats terrible. Some people are scumbags. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The sun is shining here and I have no plans. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a perfect day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never knew I was doing this one math problem wrong until my friend let me know. I really didn't think I was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Do you know how to do it correctly now though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I woke up this morning there was a wasp in my bedroom <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I would've freaked out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I brought my very first car after years of saving money <endOfText>
<human> Well done! What kind of car did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin won a athlete meet not long ago. I remember him in his nappies. I should say am very happy <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How old is he now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss earns way more money than me for less work. <endOfText>
<human> Chain of command do work. We can't help it, I feel the same <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fed some dead bodies to pigs. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of dead bodies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend want's nothing to do with me anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my girlfriend ran into one of her friend's and it made me upset. <endOfText>
<human> Why did it make you upset? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a new Audi. <endOfText>
<human> Wow he must be pretty loaded. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It always feels really good to think about great, happy times. <endOfText>
<human> It does, any recent event that made you feel like that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister helped me study for my finals, and now thanks to her I got an amazing grade <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, congrats was this during a college course? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to find another job this week <endOfText>
<human> Well good luck for you. you don't like your old one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new offer in another company, but i do not want to move <endOfText>
<human> No. Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a tv show last night where a guy ate a live squid <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that sounds like something I wouldn't do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I bought my very first videogame with my own money <endOfText>
<human> Really? What game did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've worn a necklace that my dad got me every day since. <endOfText>
<human> Since when? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After he gave me the car I couldn't believe it <endOfText>
<human> What car did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a test the other day. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a great pizza the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh what kind of pizza? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview next week <endOfText>
<human> I hope you are prepared <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching tv when I saw someone eat a live insect <endOfText>
<human> Really? Thats disgusting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my cousin got into a fight. He broke my piano, which grandfather gifted me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pizza got delivered and it's cold. <endOfText>
<human> that sucks!! you should have been really annoyed with the delivery boy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What could you do when you prepare for everything and the unthinkable still happens. <endOfText>
<human> You can only do your best in an unexpected situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an unexpected parcel the other day <endOfText>
<human> Was it from someone you knew? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The person that was handling my hotel reservation had troubles expressing himself as he didn't spoke very well <endOfText>
<human> What made him not speak well in your eyes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This girl flat out lied to me in the most rude possible way. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's awful to hear, how did yo react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke out my car window. <endOfText>
<human> Were they trying to steal from your car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got randomly invited to a party in a weird part of town so I was hesitant to go to it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview coming up <endOfText>
<human> Is it for a hourly wage job or salary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had one of those moments in your life that you have no clue how you are still alive? <endOfText>
<human> Once or twice. What happened to make you ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was, the worst was having to through out pictures, baby blankets, yearbooks...basically everything <endOfText>
<human> Such a shame.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man eat 10 hamburgers. <endOfText>
<human> That is really impressive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I was quite inspired. <endOfText>
<human> I could use some burgers myself right now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't understand people sometimes. I talk to girls and things are going well and then they suddenly ghost me. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, my friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I woke up there was a wasp in my bedroom <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is awful, did it sting you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog bit a lady's dress, it made me feel very ashamed, she was almost naked in the street <endOfText>
<human> That's quiet funny though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a meal from Wendy's earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Was it good? I've never eaten there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a parcel in the mail the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bet me that I wouldn't lose weight since I was a little chubby. I knew I could so I took the bet. <endOfText>
<human> Did you lose weight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone hit me in the mouth and I lost a tooth. <endOfText>
<human> Oh damn! How long ago was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my wallet at work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Will you get it back OK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first ever date was a disaster <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally ate someone else's cake at work <endOfText>
<human> Really? Did they find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had your heart truly broken? <endOfText>
<human> I guess no. Have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning to start my world tour. <endOfText>
<human> For music? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my rug today <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My girlfriend dumped me yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that's a bummer, how did that happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the new football season. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. Who do you support? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I managed to perfectly dispose of some bodies this week. <endOfText>
<human> Perhaps some pigs helped you out with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hey dude actually last night i met my old friend after a long time. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Sometimes I think of morbid stuff and, you guessed it, it makes me upset. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you think about it then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has been ignoring me for the whole day <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying. Why is she doing that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker just bought a new Mercedes. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Going back to college is so bittersweet most of the time. <endOfText>
<human> I understand, you will miss home but also excited for college. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son came first in his English class, which is a big deal since he is Asian. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that makes sense, aren't academics huge in asian culture? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You're right, thats why I am so proud of him for keeping up the family tradition. <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear that he is performing so well. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> We walked to a gas station that was luckily pretty close by. <endOfText>
<human> Phew! Good have ended a lot worse if that gas station wasn't there. <endOfText>

<human> Ugh! She was probably doing it on purpose to annoy you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever thought something was yours and you wanted it so bad only to find out that it wasn't? <endOfText>
<human> yea it feels so bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my rug today <endOfText>
<human> Is she sick or was it was one time thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone ate the last slice of pizza. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I thought that it wouldn't be any good considering that Russia was hosting but it turned out amazingly and some of the matches were just spectacular. <endOfText>

<human> I know the feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a six layer bean dip later. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a lot of hard work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother was in a drunken mood last night. He said nasty things and broke my furniture <endOfText>
<human> That's not acceptable even if he is drunk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, I am so angry with him. He has been doing for years now. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I walked into a final knowing that I was gonna fail and it was so nerve wracking. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you so down on yourself about failing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find it hard to be faithful <endOfText>
<human> To your partners, you mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah cause I love women and can't seem to settle for one. <endOfText>
<human> You should find a way to be satisfied with just one person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Mother in Law offered to buy us almost all the furniture for the nursery. <endOfText>
<human> That's a great gesture! Is this for your first child? <endOfText>

<human> thats disgusting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never been  this unhappy in my whole life <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Have you tried to talk to a professional about that? <endOfText>

<human> That's terrible. I hope the situation sorts itself out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother needs a liver transplant. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I should be asleep right now! It's the weekend <endOfText>
<human> Same here, though it is the summer for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get annoyed when I see over weight people <endOfText>

<human> So sorry, that must be devastating for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So sorry, that must be devastating for you. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it's tough to kind of see him on his last leg. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get embarrassed when I have to get intimate <endOfText>
<human> Why do you get embarrassed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure if I'm any good at it and am always evaluating my performance. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I always feel confident after a few drinks <endOfText>
<human> That is the case for me too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took an hour for my pizza to get here. <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats a long time to wait for pizza. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wore my old letter jacket yesterday, I found it stuffed back in my closet. <endOfText>

<human> Have you been studying? how do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new girlfriend and my dog became friends way too fast. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds somewhat weird. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a really scary movie last night. <endOfText>
<human> what movie? did you survive the night? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am meeting my blind date today for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dumped my girlfriend for a younger woman. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, why on earth did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched my best friend juggle knifes. <endOfText>
<human> Are you serious? I wish I could do that. Was he apart of a show <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so close to breaking my wifes heart- have you ever broken someones heart? <endOfText>
<human> yes I have and its not fun at all, why would you have to break your wifes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother was my saving grace growing up, I was on a bad path. <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like a sweet woman. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when the Ice Cream man came around my neighborhood. <endOfText>

<human> yes she does, I really could not live a day without her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate an entire pizza and had a cup of nice warm hot coffee. <endOfText>
<human> Yum! Pizza for breakfast? My favorite. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up too early. Everyone else is sleeping <endOfText>
<human> Go back to sleep! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently moved to a new city and I don't have any friends here <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  Have you tried looking up organizations in your new area to meet people with similar interests? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am here at home alone while all my friends are out at the lake today.  :( <endOfText>
<human> Aw, were you too busy to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy that I called my mom in time for her birthday this year.  I felt good about myself that I'm a good son who still keeps in touch with his mom. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's so nice of you! I bet she appreciated it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend forgot to tell me he wasn't coming over so I missed out on other plans like going to a game! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I would be so mad...did he apologize at all <endOfText>

<human> That stinks, did they give you fair notice so you had chance to find a new place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Why are people so inconsiderate. Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is at her job interview. I'm sure she got it in the bag. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope she gets it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home yesterday to a ripped up couch <endOfText>

<human> That sounds awesome. Enjoy your day off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks.  It's so peaceful and I am so relaxed and stress free at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> Oh you got the place all to yourself, too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a terribly beaten dog on the street. <endOfText>

<human> Wow, that is coming up soon.  I be you are excited.  Is this your first child? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I joined a dancing class <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  Are you a dancer <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was at college, some tenagers were extorting money from me. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. How did they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I shouldn't have, but I texted a girl to ask her on a date. <endOfText>
<human> What did she say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a huge delivery. Not even sure I can get it through the door. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what did you order <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If I get a good pump at the gym early in the morning, I feel like I can tackle any task on my to-do list for the day <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. do you usually exercise in the mornings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally made my own pizza. I think it's gonna be good. <endOfText>
<human> That's impressive, was it difficult to make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the doctor recently for my annual check-up, I always think they're going to tell me something's wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Check-ups can be nerve wrecking sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a turtle in my yard. <endOfText>
<human> really? i tortoise? i have one in my backyard too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home last night <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Was there no one to walk home with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a school of dogs cross the street together. <endOfText>
<human> what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I texted a girl for a date. She sent the text to all my friends. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My cat is at the kitty spa. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's cool.  Sounds like he's living the dream lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I might get a haircut tonight.  Nothing like a high fade to get me feeling fresh and ready to chat up some honeys <endOfText>
<human> Nice! How often do you get haircuts? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work a lot, but I'm not worried. My wife is amazing and would never cheat on me. <endOfText>
<human> That is good. I am glad to hear that you are comfortable with life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As soon as my husband gets home from work, I have to leave to go to work. <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. Maybe  you both can take some time off of work and be together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my kids left and i felt all alone <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible news. I hope they are in good hands. Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I am stuck at work today.  I had bought a lottery ticket last week thinking I wouldn't have to work this week. lol <endOfText>
<human> heh well at least you can be here while working <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> ooooh I would be too!  I had someone dent my car too last week.  I feel your pain! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is getting older and is starting to walk a little slower these days. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Are you taking him to the vet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A coworker helped me move to another city. He was so kind. <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice of them, did they help you move your heavy appliances and stuff too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy that I've got more maturity and self-discipline than most of my friends.  Based on my bank account and current income I can tell hen it's a good time to party and when it's a good time to stay in.  This situation also explains why most of them are broke and I'm not. <endOfText>
<human> thats cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What type of pet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> I would have been too. Were you at a store parking lot or at work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> walmart parking lot <endOfText>
<human> That is so awful. I guess they didn't bother to leave a note? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I had a wardrobe malfunction at work. <endOfText>
<human> what happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was irked when i couldnt get the day off <endOfText>
<human> Why? What was going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> too much work to have time off approved <endOfText>
<human> That's disappointing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker always seems to due my job better than me. She's nothing special so I'm so upset about that. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of work do you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are both sales reps at a car dealer. <endOfText>
<human> Well I'm sure you've both got your own unique skills...what would you say are 3 things you do well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm amazed at how much better I've gotten at writing lyrics in just 6 months it's crazy. <endOfText>
<human> That's really awesome! What kind of lyrics do you write? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I write mainly hip hop lyrics.  Not the dumb commercial trap rap, more introspective stuff <endOfText>
<human> That's really great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a mistake at work. My manager have set a meeting to talk about it. I am a little bit worried. <endOfText>
<human> what do you think is going to happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was hoping to get the day off <endOfText>
<human> Why do you need a day off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The lottery ticket I bought last night did not win. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, well that's to be expected I guess. Do you play the lottery often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered pizza and it should be here any moment. I keep looking out the window to check, and I can feel my brain slowly turning into a caveman brain I'm so hungry. <endOfText>
<human> Yum that sounds delicious. You're making me hungry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I draw for about an hour almost every day, and I've been doing it for a long time. I only ever just wanted to be able to draw fun doodles, but the other day I looked and I actually feel good about my drawing skills, finally. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Practice makes perfect.    <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great. Practice makes perfect. <endOfText>
<human> It really does! It was miserable starting because you put so much effort into something you don't even like the end result of, but it's well worth it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I got first place in a 1 mile race today. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! How long have you been running for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had my first baby last week. <endOfText>
<human> congrats... how has the first week been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> That is kind of you. What kind of pet was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to try so hard to find that one perfect partner to stay loyal to...until I found out that my dreams are the only thing worth chasing <endOfText>
<human> I remember in highschool we had a biology teacher and the kids kept badgering him about if he had a wife. When he said he didn't but he was happy the way he was, nobody understood it. It's something I found wisdom in much later in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew I bombed this chemistry test and we got the results yesterday. I somehow squeaked by with a B! <endOfText>
<human> Great job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i couildnt leave work <endOfText>
<human> I can understand.  Then are times when I want to get out of work too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea .. i mean the work is going to be there waiting for me the next day.. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it is helpful to take a break and go home early.  It allows you to kind of reset. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whew! Finally got to mow my horribly large yard before it got too tall and it starts raining <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome.. how long did that take <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to see i got next week off! <endOfText>
<human> I hope it's paid too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really liked fossils so I went to my local museum. It was pretty cool and they had a lot of awesome fossils. <endOfText>
<human> I love fossils! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for monday! <endOfText>
<human> What's going on Monday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my dog has cancer today <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is it serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a promotion at work that I wasn't expecting. It was really awesome! <endOfText>
<human> Congradulations.  I assume it comes with a pay raise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when i couldnt go home on time <endOfText>
<human> what do you mean? did you get stuck somewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy started to turn pale, I just envisioned him throwing up all over my car. <endOfText>
<human> did you throw him out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine died Thursday and I hadn't called her in about in a month <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! I'm really sorry to hear that, but even if you could have said something it doesn't just make it better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm just thinking about quitting my job. My boss is the worst; every time he asks for my idea, if it works it becomes "his" idea and if it fails it's "your" idea. <endOfText>
<human> That would be annoying. If there is anybody over him, you might try reporting it first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing like a fresh pair of Air Nikes to make me feel ready to take on the world <endOfText>
<human> Man I have recently been getting into shoes, I dont have nearly as many as some of my buddies,  need to step my game up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to flirt with my crush and completely made a fool of myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh hate when that happens.  How did you know you acted a fool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a cheater in highs school. I always got some nerd to help me, bet now I really regret it. <endOfText>
<human> We all do stupid stuff as kids.  The important thing is you realize how bad that behavior is now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, but that  doesn't stop me from being upset about it. <endOfText>
<human> I understand regret over previous actions, but you just got to move forward. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a hole in one the other day.  It was just his second time ever playing golf!  Talk about unexpected. <endOfText>
<human> Good for him! The only time I've ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for him! The only time I've ever gotten a hole in one in golf is on a video game. <endOfText>
<human> Ha!  Me too.  And I have been playing golf for years.  I thought my eyes were playing tricks on me when I saw the ball go in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle died in a car crash yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> You and me both. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset to see someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Car door? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every Christmas song I hear on the radio for some reason reminds me of my extended family back home and the good times we had when I was younger. <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool that you have those awesome memories. Do you ever go baack and see your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm am so afraid of the dark. I can't fall asleep so I have to have a light on in order to fall asleep. <endOfText>
<human> Have you always had this fear of the dark <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah ever since I was a little kid. <endOfText>
<human> Is there any specific reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to go to hawaii next year <endOfText>
<human> have you ever been there before? I hear it's great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am anxiously awaiting a second puppy from a dog I rescued. I thought she might be pregnant but then I thought she wasn't after a week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, where do you get these pets? from a shelter or off the street? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super shocked when our rescued malnourished dog popped out a puppy when I got up this morning! <endOfText>
<human> wow thats great, is that the one you got off the street? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had left my gate open and my dog was missing <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god..I would be too! No locks? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new dog keeps trying to sit on her new puppy. It's making me quite upset. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried find a away to keep the seperated? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure that it will get better. Dogs are really smart so if you keep working with her I'm sure she will get it. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, she is young..and clearly very neglected as she was starved...Can't even believe she had a healthy puppy..I think something weird happened to her pups before. Poor dog! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm nervous about going to work on Monday. I have a meeting with my boss but I don't know what it's about Can you give me any advice? <endOfText>
<human> I am bad with anxiety too but if you haven't done anything wrong then all you can do is try to have some self confidence and prepare for the worst and HOPE for the best. You never know- you could be getting a raise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I guess that could be true, but my company hasn't been doing well lately and a lot of people have already been laid off. <endOfText>
<human> Prepare then and you will feel better- either way it goes you will be prepared- so if it's bad- you will already have known and if it's not- then you will get surprised. Either way it won't rock your world. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I just don't want to have to find another job though. I twould mean I may have to move to a different city with my family. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! Well all you can do is prepare early as you just never know! Life isfull of change. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our new dog who was starved just had a puppy today. We thought she was pregnant before but after a week of food- she seemed to have a normal stomach. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awesome.  What breed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got more sympathy for poor people who are actually trying to improve their situation, than those who are just looking for a handout <endOfText>
<human> Well of course..Like all the drunks and druggies begging for money who won't work on my corner? Most people are poor..and work hard! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so upset. My dog that I've had ever since he was a little puppy just died. We were friends for 20 years. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm sorry :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. He was really old and had a lot of health problems so it really was for the best. <endOfText>
<human> Pets are great but they sure are tragic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thankfully ready for when a puppy came today. I have lots of clean blankets, a clean room and extra money if needed! <endOfText>
<human> That's good that you were prepared! Puppys can be a handful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited to see my family. I haven't been home in sooooo long. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! Tell me about your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its for school. I go to university 1000 miles away <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! That would be so hard!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why did you move away from home? That is cool to have a brother in highschool. Highschoolers usually aren't home much anyhow <endOfText>
<human> Its for school. I go to university 1000 miles away  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well...our abused starved gal had herself a puppy today! I was incredibly shocked. <endOfText>
<human> You the pitbull guy? haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> GAL! ;) <endOfText>
<human> Gal :)) what did you end up naming the pup? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling pretty blessed these days...I know I can always trace it back to the love, support, and steadfast belief of my parents that I can achieve anything I set my mind to <endOfText>
<human> It's rare to have great parents it seems, I am glad you have good ones! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super sad this weekend. I wish my partner would be done with therapy already and be home <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I hate to hear that. How long have you two been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a pomegranate the other day on a whim. I haven't had one since I was a kid, so it brought back from memories when I was snacking on it. <endOfText>
<human> I have never actually had one of those! We don't get very exotic fruits here in the midwest. What do they taste like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> Why, the odds are not in your favor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were going to go swimming today. The weather was bad though so we had to cancel <endOfText>
<human> so what was plan B? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to treat myself tonight and make grill a huge steak for myself tonight. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really great and delicious!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds really great and delicious! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it would have been if I hadn't burned it to a crisp and turned it into a black charred piece of leather! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends left him in the middle of the night. I feel sick for him <endOfText>
<human> who did they leave and where? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw my dog was missing <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hate that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a huge stuffed bear on my yard. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds creepy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really calm today. I just sat on the patio and read <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a relaxing day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I checked my mail and was so shocked. There was a check with a $1000 in an evelope with my name on it! <endOfText>
<human> Well that comes in handy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I'm a little worried that it isn't real. <endOfText>
<human> ah.. take it to the bank to find out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lady Luck is the only woman in my life who hasn't failed me yet (besides my mom lol)...I see a lot of good things in our future together $$$$$$ <endOfText>
<human> Whys that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because my life is the epitome of that Drake song blessings on blessings on blessings ;) <endOfText>
<human> Excellent <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My weekend is going well so far. I am hoping tomorrow nothing bad happens <endOfText>
<human> I am sure tomorrow will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went into that interview knowing i was going to crush it <endOfText>
<human> That's great that you were so confident. I wish I could be like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so made at George Lucas. How could he think something like the Phantom Menace would be a good idea for a movie! <endOfText>
<human> it made him a ton of money so i think thats all that mattered to him at that point cause i agree it was crap. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know I like to think he is better than that. <endOfText>
<human> that was back then when he was trying to do something great, the drive isnt there when you have already done it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought me a programming course. <endOfText>
<human> that was nice of them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What pet does she have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One big pet peeve of mine is a poor person complaining about his/her situation and doing absolutely nothing to fix it <endOfText>
<human> i get that. i am in pain every morning and get up and go to work everyday. so it's hard to find sympathy from me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really wanted to get pregnant but month after month it didn't happen <endOfText>
<human> Hmm maybe it's not your time yet...I'm sure you'll get there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a $100 Costco cash card. Gonna spend it all at the food court. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome. That's a whole lotta pizza slices. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nextdoor neighbor is getting dementia. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. Who is taking care of your neighbor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was speeding, because I was worried about my mom. <endOfText>
<human> I understand! Did you get in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked my dog had a healthy baby after being starved for most of her pregnancy! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why was she starved? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little sad with the weather today. We had to cancel plans <endOfText>
<human> Rainy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life can be hard sometimes or even often. <endOfText>
<human> That's true. What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stayed up all night to decorate the office. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! What does it look like now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyday in every way I'm getting better and better.  Still waiting on my big come up but I'm in no rush, just enjoying the view ;) <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my coworker. Her replacement just isn't the same. <endOfText>
<human> Bummer.  You still keep in touch with her or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My external hard disk has stop working. I had very important data on it. It can't be fixed. <endOfText>
<human> That must be frustrating. What are you going to do now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I've got popcorn kernels to last me through retirement. I wonder how long they keep for. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get a job I interviewed for. <endOfText>
<human> Dang that stinks, better luck next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw there was a dent in my car door. <endOfText>
<human> Do you know how it happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister n law washed my clothes today for me. It was a nice gesture <endOfText>
<human> That's very nice of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother like spiders but I am scared of them! I can't handle those things! <endOfText>
<human> I am not sure how anyone could like those things <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I don't know either. <endOfText>
<human> I do not like them either though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even more upset then I already was that the dog I rescued was not only starved but starved AND pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> That poor dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty annoyed at the store earlier. The cashiers were being slow <endOfText>
<human> Did they just not care? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a lot done this week, made good money, got things I needed, some I wanted and still saved up! <endOfText>
<human> what are you saving up for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out a very simple part to my lawn mower is VERY expensive from all the mower parts places. <endOfText>
<human> Which part <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> trying to same money for a trip. trying to get pregnant. just lots of stuff <endOfText>
<human> where do you want to go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im ready for next week! <endOfText>
<human> what's happening next week? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking forward to getting my cats a new cat tree tomorrow! It is a warehouse deal so I am hoping it is in good shape! <endOfText>
<human> I hope the cat likes it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little upset earlier. My brother did not meet me for lunch <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Was he honest with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am happy that the kids return to school next week <endOfText>
<human> I think a lot of parents are! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's home is being foreclosed on. <endOfText>
<human> is there anything that can be done to save it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i forgot my house keys at work <endOfText>
<human> It happens a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a nice day. I just sat on the patio and relaxed <endOfText>
<human> thats always nice to have time to sit and relax <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has been very distant lately. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, any reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was angry last night. My friend was drunk and irritating <endOfText>
<human> Some drunks are funny, and some are unfortunately annoying as hell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pulled over for speeding the other day.  The cop actually was really cool and just gave me a warning.  I was very relieved. <endOfText>
<human> You  got lucky.  I don't ever seem to get warnings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I interviewed for a jew job on friday. I think it went well. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy that you think your interview was successful.  I know they can be nervewracking sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was saddened to see i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> i bet. that would be a bummer for anyone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so glad that i have an understanding and kind husband <endOfText>
<human> why what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hoping this next week is going to be a good paying work week too! <endOfText>
<human> Nice what do you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These days I've got my mind to the horizon of my dreams...because my feet are always taking giant leaps and landing where I need them to <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! You are reaching your goals then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I grew up, I didn't appreciate my brother who raised me because my family was so busy. Now as an adult, I realized all the times I resented him, he was just trying to help me. He did so much by putting me through college. I can't help but get teary when I realize how much he cared about me. <endOfText>
<human> That is very sweet. Family is important <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped last night in front of people. I felt bad about it <endOfText>
<human> Ah man! You shouldn't feel bad about tripping. Why do you feel bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i enjoy gardening and seeing what all the hard work will lead to <endOfText>
<human> I don't have a green thumb myself. What plants are you growing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got these shoes for over 5 years now. The sole is all worn out. <endOfText>
<human> Interesting.  You gonna get new ones <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't get mad easy.  But if there's anything that ticks me off a lot it's someone who tries too hard to make an impression.  Like if I like you I like you if I don't I don't it's that simple really haha <endOfText>
<human> Some people don't realize it's just as easy as being comfortable being yourself to be accepted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took me 5 hours to bake this cake for my daughter, and now it's missing. <endOfText>
<human> hrmm, did it grow legs and walk away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> I think we've all gone through that. How many tickets did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking tomorrow is going to be nice. I am going to church <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great. Are you going to go get brunch after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom went on a diet and lost 40lbs. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that is great for her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is taking me to church tomorrow. Its a nice gesture from him <endOfText>
<human> That is nice, do you usually go to church?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is nice, do you usually go to church? <endOfText>
<human> I do not, but I am looking forward to it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw my dog got out <endOfText>
<human> I have heard that a lot today! How did yours get out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a great two weeks with work <endOfText>
<human> that sounds good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is getting married. I am so happy for him <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, are you in the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot about my friends birthday last week. I felt bad about it <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Do you forget birthdays a lot? I do sometimes. Always good to set reminds on your google calender etc <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have money saved up, I am making extra money the past few weeks and there has been no big dramas. <endOfText>
<human> Saving money is so important <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am really looking forward to taking a few days away from work before the end of the year <endOfText>
<human> Yea, you definitely need a break every now and then. Is it vacation time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still have the computer my dad got me back in 1998 or so. <endOfText>
<human> that is so cool. i loved the old school computers <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new job promised a raise at the end of 90 days, but I still haven't heard anything <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will get it eventually <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched my friends dog for her. She is going through some things so I wanted to look out for her <endOfText>
<human> You are a great friend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when my dog got loose <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine. Luckily mine don't go far when they do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea he likes to dig and go run around  the sub division. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure it was a challenge getting him back home, at least you got some exercise haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put in vacation request months ago and am now just being told they can't grant it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Why did it take them so long to get back with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We homeschool our girls and my oldest had to take a biology class last year. <endOfText>
<human> Do you mean the biology class was taken at a school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been able to find my favorite pineapple coconut cake anywhere, but there's a new bakery opening up soon <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Would you be buying your cake there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am helping a friend that has lost his job recently. <endOfText>
<human> That's very kind of you. How long has he lost his job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a bunch of guinea pigs gang up on a pig <endOfText>
<human> who won? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for monday to get here! <endOfText>
<human> People usually dread Mondays. What's happening that day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe this cat lept from a 10 foot tall slide. <endOfText>
<human> Cats are very fun, sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> uh oh, did something happen? <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hit the wrong button. Sorry, I miss my dad this time of year. It makes me think of him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone left their trash in the bed of my truck. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that kind of thing would make me furious. Do you have any idea who it might have been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so happy the kids are going back to school. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure they aren't though, hahahaha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having some serious headaches lately. I don't know why. <endOfText>
<human> you should probably go to the doctor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought some treats for my cat this weekend. I just had a plan <endOfText>
<human> What's your plan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last piece of cake. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of cake was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow is going to be fun. We are going hiking and kayaking <endOfText>
<human> That sounds pretty amazing. Is the place you go to nearby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The hotdog I had tasted pretty funky. I'm not sure if it's gone bad <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do not get sick! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have entered a poker tournament for next weekend.  I think I have a pretty good chance at winning. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awesome, I've never played before! It is hard to learn? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke up with my girlfriend this same time last year <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate, made a new one since? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i can't stand to go the bathroom at work after someone else <endOfText>
<human> so do you wait till you are back at home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw my dog was missing <endOfText>
<human> oh no. did you find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So no real plans this weekend... Just sitting here alone. <endOfText>
<human> Being alone is good sometimes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did pretty good on my math test. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad, what grade did you get <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty alone today. I did not hear from anyone <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Have you tried contacting your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was not happy when i was told that i had to go into work on saturday <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you. Work is a drag <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sad this time of year. It makes me think of my dad <endOfText>
<human> im sorry  to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wasnt happy when i had to go into work on saturday <endOfText>
<human> That never sounds fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have felt alone all weekend. I guess my friends were busy <endOfText>
<human> Aww I'm sorry, i hope you atleast got some good relaxing time alone! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared driving on thursday. It was raining so hard <endOfText>
<human> did you pull over or keep pushing through <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im happy that the kids will be returning to school next week! <endOfText>
<human> What grades are they in <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother has assured me we are going on a trip soon. I am holding him to that <endOfText>
<human> do you think its going to happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i had to go into work on a saturday <endOfText>
<human> I hate that. Work is never fun on the weekends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got a job promotion. I am happy for him <endOfText>
<human> Great! What kind of job and how good of a promotion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got the wrong part for my mower. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to get the right part? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job on monday. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Happy with my momma dog. I would've thought after all her abuse she wouldn't be that good of a momma <endOfText>
<human> Its instinctive. They  pretty much know what to do by instinct. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive to see lebron sign with the lakers and leave the cavs a second time <endOfText>
<human> i don't really follow players when they get so big that they seem like they are getting too big for their britches <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really love to look at old photo albums and see how everyone has grown and how things have changed <endOfText>
<human> ah yes its always nice to take a moment to remember the past <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got to go on a trip this weekend without me. I am pretty envious <endOfText>
<human> Why was it without you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor is out again having a party...I find it strange because he yelled at me on a night before when he was working...but it's okay when he wants too? <endOfText>
<human> No, not if he is being loud and rude, that is never okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They are very strange. I don't understand that selfishness. People work all different days and hours. Of course he doesn't have the nerve to go yell at the people who set off fireworks all night after 10. <endOfText>
<human> I guess he has no care for anyone but himself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was making myself a pancake the other day and my dog kept bothering me. <endOfText>
<human> did he get a beat down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet the other day <endOfText>
<human> What kind of pet was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my mom's birthday was 2 days ago <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I'm sure she will understand! My send some nice flowers and a sorry card. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Starting some new herbs and I am a bit scared I might have bad effects. <endOfText>
<human> Just be careful, I am sure you know what you are doing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to tomorrow, Church should be fun <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you go! What kind of church is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends left to dinner without me since I canceled last minute <endOfText>
<human> Why did you have to cancel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sitting in traffic the other day because there was a wreck up ahead. <endOfText>
<human> Were the people involved ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This summer heat is almost over! <endOfText>
<human> yes i cant wait for it to be over! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> It's good to have friends you can count on like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad it's going to be fall soon. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah its really hot here. I can't wait for it to cool off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a date tomorrow afternoon. I think its going go to well.3 <endOfText>
<human> aw that's so sweet. I hope it goes well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is always at least 30 minutes late to everything. <endOfText>
<human> sounds like my wife <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im hoping to win the lottery tonight <endOfText>
<human> Nice. How many tickets did ya get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a test yesterday, but I made sure to study throughout the week before. <endOfText>
<human> how do you feel like it went? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hoped that my supervisor or director would acknowledge my hard work <endOfText>
<human> They still have not taken notice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my dog this time of year. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened the back door to let my dog out and a giant roach tried to fly in the door. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Did the roach make it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost 20 pounds this year. Think I'll look great in my suit. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! How did you go about losing so much weight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know actually speaking on that, I've historically been a terrible cook but I've been practicing a lot and I'm getting really comfortable with where I'm at. I made caramel-fudge brownies today and they were reaaally good. <endOfText>
<human> Man, that sounds really delicious. Where'd you get the recipe? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We keep getting these flood warnings, but they never happen when we're told it will. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that must be confusing, scary and fustrating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog nursed me back to health. She's such a sweetheart. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Can you explain that more? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have money to buy my brother a present. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's sad. I have been there more than I like to admit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was jobless but recently I found a job. I will be able pay my bills and avoid be evicted from my appartment. <endOfText>
<human> wow that is awesome that you were able to do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get my daughter the gift she wanted <endOfText>
<human> That is sad. What was the gift she wanted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm so blessed. i have a great husband and together we have built a good life <endOfText>
<human> Good life partners are hard to find. You hold on to him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw this little chihuahua tell off a parrot. <endOfText>
<human> oh really how? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's this guy that keeps wondering around my home the same time each day. <endOfText>
<human> ohh, strange. Keep an eye on him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week when I was coming back to my home from office, a strange man approached me <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has been taking ballet since she was 2 - she's almost 16 now. <endOfText>
<human> wow, she should be very good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister lost her job recently. I am trying to help her. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! You are being nice to try and help her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few days ago I took my personal training certification test. I really thought I did horribly, but today I got my results in the mail and I scored a 98%! <endOfText>
<human> wow thats a great score! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. I'm so stoked! I guess I shouldn't doubt myself; I did study pretty hard. <endOfText>
<human> hard work pays off as they say. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to see lebron leave the cavs a second time <endOfText>
<human> I actually don't know too much about basketball, so I really don't have a strong opinion on that. Is that a bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel positive about my money making abilities no matter what happens in the next few months. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Do you have a traditional job or do you work for yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cursed in front of my grandmother the other day. <endOfText>
<human> O really? how'd she react to hearing that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone tried to steal the tailgate off of my truck last night. <endOfText>
<human> oh my were they able to take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when people think they can blatenly just flirt with your partner <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that's annoying.  Welcome to the problems of having an attactive mate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A day before yesterday, my cat died <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry, it's hard to lose our animals, they become a part of our family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend's mom has terminal lung cancer. <endOfText>
<human> ohh, that's bad. I feel sorry for her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it upset me to see my brother pulling up in a new BMW <endOfText>
<human> Why? Did he steal it? haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband I are fixing my parents house. <endOfText>
<human> Well that is very nice of you.  Is it a pretty big project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I in a plane last month and we hit a bunch of turbulance.  It was very unnerving and the plane was shaking a lot <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats scary!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh thats scary! <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I am not the best flyer anyway, so I really did not have a good time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I waited for my sister all day today. She was 6 hours late <endOfText>
<human> Why was she so late, thats terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no idea. I didn{t get to do anything I planned today because I had her kids. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry. I hope she makes it up for her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to buy Legos for  my nephew the other day. <endOfText>
<human> ohh that's nice. Legos was one of my favorite games, when I was a kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever seen tiger woods game? <endOfText>
<human> I have not - do you enjoy watching him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 18 years old and living on my own, my dad still helped me pay for half of a pickup truck so I could have a way to get around. I'm so thankful to him, because I still use this truck today, 12 years later! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. It is so nice of him. I am supprissed that the pick up lasted 12 years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was keeping my savings at home in safe. My house was recently robbed. The safe is gone also. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you have any sort of security cameras to see who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am watching alpha dogs <endOfText>
<human> Is that a movie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are doing a lot of work on our house right now. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Has it been taking a long time_ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The traffic last night was nerve wracking. A lot of traffic and aggressive driving <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, was it way worse then normal due to weather? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really miss my family. it's hard to be 800 miles away <endOfText>
<human> I bet! Hopefully you can take some time off and go see them soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it's really hard to do that in a one income household. <endOfText>
<human> I understand, I'm sure your family misses you as well. Maybe you can meet half way for the holidays. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new semester starts at the end of the month and I think I have bought all the supplies I need to be ready. <endOfText>
<human> My kids just started back Thurs and my new semester starts then too. I definitely understand <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in school, when I was playing soccer with my friends, I accidentally tackled my friend <endOfText>
<human> Were they pokay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a good feeling about tomorrow. I think its going to be fun <endOfText>
<human> ohh good for you. But why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law makes me furious almost on a daily basis. <endOfText>
<human> Why does she do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic when I think about this time of year. It makes me think of when I was younger <endOfText>
<human> Time sure flies doesn't it - what is it about this time of year that takes you back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really enjoy keeping up with old family traditions i grew up with <endOfText>
<human> I like those as well, what are some of yours <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what is 4 for? <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry. I meant to say I was irritated by the weather this week. I wish the sun would come out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I spilled some tea on my pants and it looked like I had an accident IN my pants. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been an embarsing situation but we've all been there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got to play golf today. I wanted to, but I had to work <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer!  Were you upset about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it seems like every other family in my daughter's class lives in a mansion. <endOfText>
<human> It must be nice to be rich <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really love keeping up with old family traditions i grew up with <endOfText>
<human> O yea? what kind would that be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is moving away soon. I am pretty sad about it <endOfText>
<human> That's sad to hear - it's hard to find a true good friend.  How far away are they moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father in law was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and I tried to help take care of him. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry. I am sure he appreciates you being there for him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really like the feeling of the unknown on christmas morning <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, that was a great feeling to have, especially as a child. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling very happy about being able to go camping next weekend! <endOfText>
<human> that's awesome. i really want to go camping but we haven't been able to yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not get my paycheck cleared before the weekend. I was pretty mad at myself <endOfText>
<human> That would be disappointing. What will you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just graduated from high school <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are proud of her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband took our girls on a father-daddy day trip the other day. <endOfText>
<human> how sweet. what did they do on their special day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really want to see what my husband and i will accomplish by the end of the year <endOfText>
<human> In what areas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in school, my best friend got better grade than me. And it was an important subject <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, did they just study more or what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for my dream job but I never got a call back. <endOfText>
<human> oh that's bad. I feel sorry for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I crashed my car yesterday <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry, are you okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a new dog. Its my favorite breed, so I am a little envious <endOfText>
<human> I bet it is so cute! What breed is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is not coming home this weekend, I am pretty upset about it <endOfText>
<human> Is there a way you could go and see him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have a medical test done about a month ago - all was fine but geez! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy the houses in my neighborhood are far apart <endOfText>
<human> You dont like your neighbors? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids start school next week. <endOfText>
<human> Well congrats! Is it kindergarten? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally walked out with my drink in my hand at the store and forgot to pay for it. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. I think everyone does that sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was walking out of the bathroom at work after the person before me had really stunk up the place then i open the ddoor to find my boss waiting to used the bathroom <endOfText>
<human> Does your boss has thought it is you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been jobless for 6 months now. Next week, I have five interviews. I hope to be hire in one of those positions <endOfText>
<human> i hope that you will get the job that is going to be what is best for you. stay positive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe I got accepted to school. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of school <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really hoping to go to the waterpark this weekend but it doesn't look like I'm gonna get to go. <endOfText>
<human> Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a salad today and had it delivered to the house <endOfText>
<human> Well that's mighty convenient, was it delicious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to do well at work next week, I have been working on a project <endOfText>
<human> That's great. So you are confident in the progress of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was gonna go camping this weekend, but now it looks like it will rain it out. <endOfText>
<human> Rain can be annoying when it comes to that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a giant flying roach on the front porch. <endOfText>
<human> How big was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was young, we moved to Arkansas. <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy it there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never really imagined what it would be like to be a parent and then I became one. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! How was your first experience? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for summer to be over <endOfText>
<human> Me too! This heat in Texas is killing me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we moved into our new house, our cat found a field mouse that had gotten inside. <endOfText>
<human> Your cat must have got treats for that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wh didn't anyone explain adulting to me <endOfText>
<human> What's your issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is seriously delusional, spending his money so unwisely. <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe how awful I scored on that test. <endOfText>
<human> Did you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A co-worker of mine got a promotion over me. <endOfText>
<human> How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, find a new job. <endOfText>
<human> You should get on that soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any plans to try and get back at your boss? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, find a new job.  <endOfText>

<human> who cut you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing the crane machine today and I won a stuffed animal! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so happy, what animal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The zombie apocalypse will inevitably happen soon. Are you ready for it? <endOfText>
<human> I'm not prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied so hard for that test and it didnt matter. <endOfText>
<human> Did you not get a good grade on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So proud to see my buddy make the team. <endOfText>
<human> Tell your buddy I said congrats! What team was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on my first date with a girl last night and I accidentally passed gas during dinner. <endOfText>
<human> that must've been embarrassing, how did you recover? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going out of town next week, I think I have everything ready. <endOfText>
<human> Did you remember extra underwear and your toothbrush? <endOfText>

<human> I think you're gonna do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daghter is such a cool kid. <endOfText>
<human> Did she recently do something to make you think that, or has she always been that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend used to work with me, but after she quit, I have nobody to talk to. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Did she get a better job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe they denied me. <endOfText>
<human> Whos that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY ex sent me a gift for my birthday <endOfText>
<human> What did she send you as a gift? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just have to brag on my son.  He hasn't always been a strong swimmer, but tonight, after a summer of practice, I was able to see his amazing improvement! <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing hard work pays off and I think it is great that our kids know how to swim. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree.  He was never timid about swimming, but he just wasn't real good.  But tonight, he was diving (more of a belly flop) and swimming on the deep end. <endOfText>
<human> How old is he that is great my daughter is 5 I think that will be one of my goals for the remainder of the summer teaching her the basics of swimming without her life jacket.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How old is he that is great my daughter is 5 I think that will be one of my goals for the remainder of the summer teaching her the basics of swimming without her life jacket. <endOfText>
<human> He is 10.  He has been around water for most of his life; but like I said, he hasn't always been strong.  This summer, he saw the need to improve.  I think that he took his own initiative is what has thrilled me the most.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the club last night and drank too much and peed my pants. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What happened after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a nice dinner, I still feel nice and full! <endOfText>
<human> What did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of my friends are married now <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> huh? <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that, my kids are fighting over the computer and hit some buttons lol they're driving me crazy! I'm so ready for school to start back! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe she left me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to eat dinner alone for a few days this week. My husband had to go on a last minute work trip. <endOfText>
<human> You must be lonely because of that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Utah.. random state <endOfText>
<human> That is random, where does he work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work all day long and my teenager have been home all summer. <endOfText>
<human> is it gonna feel better , when they finally start going back to school ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've a business meeting tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have to make a presentation <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week everyone got raises <endOfText>
<human> well congrats!! hopefully it  was a good raise for everybody <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mom decided to sell my dog, Im heart broken. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no!  I hate to hear that.  What type of dog was she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I just have to say how sorry I am that you had to let he go.  Maybe you can keep visiting her at least. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you I'm trying to cope so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This speech has me worried. <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry, you'll do great! You're very articulate and confident. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my trash out a minute ago in the dark barefoot and wouldn't you know I stepped in dog poop! <endOfText>
<human> That's brutal, was it a big poop? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so relaxed in montreal. <endOfText>
<human> Oh is it nice there? I've never been <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever heard of a card game called Hearthstone? I've got a tournament coming up that I feel really ready for! <endOfText>
<human> I have actually, what rank are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband brought me a rose home from work, I couldn't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> That was so sweet - were you surprised? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of the people at my office have decided to quit all at once. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you quit too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is moving ot of state <endOfText>
<human> Is she going to start a college? Why is she moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Guess what. I won the table-tennis competition that was held in college among all students. I received an iPad as a prize <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. Was it the newest one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Another one of my friends got engaged <endOfText>

<human> that makes no sense lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Disney movies were so good in the early 2000s <endOfText>
<human> I always found them good. Why would you prefer the ones in the early 2000s?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always found them good. Why would you prefer the ones in the early 2000s? <endOfText>
<human> I just think they were made better back in the day. So much nostalgia. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a gang selling drugs at the corner of my street. I am afraid to walk around. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> just study harder, youll pass eventually i assure you that <endOfText>
<human> I really do hope so, any ideas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im not sure if this has happened at a job you have had, but it gets me so annoyed when the boss keeps useless employees around just because they suck up to him <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst, who's he keeping around? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> some guy that hides in the restroom , and does zero productivity <endOfText>
<human> No good, any idea what you're gonna do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This past month, due to my consistent exercising i gained 8 pounds of muscle mass with the help of Whey protein powder. I am so proud for my accomplishment <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My best friend moved to Washington this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that, is that far from where you live now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I went to Whataburger and they messed up my order <endOfText>
<human> Doesn't surprise me, they do that to me every single time I go. I'm picky though so my order is always complicated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah they always mess mine up too. I was really looking forward to it, but onions make me feel sick, ruined my meal. <endOfText>
<human> I hate onions too, even if I pick them off I can still taste them on the burger. So gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a pearl bracelet that I wear on special occasions that I inherited when my grandmother passed away. It always makes me remember her when I wear it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it's beautiful! Did she wear it often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm gonna be the last of my friends to get married, another one got engaged today. <endOfText>

<human> Oh awesome! What kind of puppy are you getting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother and I were play fighting today and I accidentally hit him in the nose. <endOfText>
<human> Did he bust his nose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter had the sweetest little hamster. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I love hamsters! What kind of a hamster was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I found out my pre baby clothes fit again. All my hard effort working out is paying off <endOfText>
<human> Well you go girl! I'm super proud of you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing a video game with my nephew and it reminded me of my older, carefree days. <endOfText>
<human> Ah yes, I know what you mean. Nowadays we barely have time to just play games. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a serial killer in my neighborhood. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that sounds pretty terrifying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is in less than a week! <endOfText>
<human> Are you doing anything special for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was late for work, so when I saw my bus coming, I ran for it. I felt a rip, and when I got on the bus I noticed that my pants had ripped right at the back! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope you were wearing clean full coverage underwear that day! <endOfText>

<human> Make sure to keep in touch! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a trip planned to the beach today but sadly it was storming all day and had to cancel <endOfText>
<human> Weather can really be fickle.  Did you have a back-up plan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we have limited space on our store so all the heavy furniture is up in the walls , one day i took the heaviest one down i was so proud of myself <endOfText>
<human> That's impressive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the customer did not even buy it after all , lol and back up in the wall it went <endOfText>
<human> That's still an impressive accomplishment! If they didn't buy it, that just means you get to take it down by yourself again! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just rode the biggest and scariest roller coaster at Six Flags today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Was it pretty exciting then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got promoted today at work! <endOfText>

<human> Are you happy or sad about it? I mean on one hand you have all that time to yourself but at the same time I'm sure you miss them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A blue 67 mustang drove by earlier and it reminded me of the one my dad had when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a classic car. Did you used to ride in it with your dad a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm super mad at people around my apartment complex. They keep tossing their used cigarettes all over the sidewalk. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh they do that at my apartment too. You should put a can outside with a big sign that says "THROW YOUR NASTY BUTTS HERE" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled coffee all over my brand new laptop yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was it damaged? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckilly I dried it up pretty quickly. so there was no serious damage. <endOfText>

<human> I know! It really is ridiculous and way out of hand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was the only one closing at work last night so it was my responsibility to lock up. <endOfText>

<human> How is she sneaky? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel weird driving by my old school <endOfText>
<human> why the feeling nolstalgia maybe ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> school can be hard on anyone , especially socialiazing with other students <endOfText>
<human> that's so tre <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is unacceptable that GOP passed massive Tax Cuts at a time when federal deficit is ballooning far beyond imagination <endOfText>
<human> I don't keep up with that stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have single for 2 years now <endOfText>
<human> Why did you break up with your partner 2 years ago? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The latest economic numbers which shows the lowers unemployment rate in more than a decade makes me feel hopeful of Trump's policies <endOfText>
<human> That's great that unemployment is down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I am going to meet the right guy soon <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> For her recent breast cancer test, my mom's aunt came out positive. I am so afraid of her health deteriorating in a rapid manner <endOfText>
<human> Thats terrible <endOfText>

<human> That sounds so frustrating! I can't stand messy people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughtes is 4 and a big ball of energy <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a handful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was expecting to get a better grade on my last exam, but alas it was lower than I had hoped. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no did you research what happened for it to be like that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a companion now so  i won't have to be alone <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I don't like being alone all the time really. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have received $8,400 credit line after my application was approved with American Express for a credit card. So satisfied with my credit score <endOfText>
<human> No I did not <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my old favorite dress when I clean my cupboard. <endOfText>
<human> What color is your favorite dress? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should have spent more time with my partner practicing her driving skills. She failed driving test for the second time already <endOfText>
<human> That is sad. Maybe you should put more effort in teaching her yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is very good at swimming and I had no idea she can swim leave alone compete <endOfText>
<human> Swimming is really fun and besides it, it is very healthy as it involves all muscles of the body to be engaged in movement <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends threw me a sudden party for my birthday. Didn't see it coming at all. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it was very fun. I was happy with it. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> So my boss just gave me a huge bonus for managing to cut down expenses by ten percent <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Well done! How did you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well it turns out we were spending a bunch of extra money paying for a service we weren't even using anymore. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good spot then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The sun is shining here and I have the day to myself. <endOfText>
<human> Must be nice, planning anything exciting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't face my parents :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Any reason why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some milk that was way back expiring at work in the back of the fridge. <endOfText>
<human> you should thrash in the waste bin <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Basically, it was a team lead position, or a management position. problem was, it was a different department that I had little experience in. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry - I'm not sure what you are talking about. What was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to watching teh Spanish Supercopa tonight. <endOfText>
<human> don't be too anxious, i trust your team will win <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what i have is enough for me, i don't bother about other people's stuff <endOfText>
<human> That's a good way to be. No point in being envious all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I for one was pretty excited when the SNES classic came out not too long ago. It's been ages since I've played those games. Since I was a kid <endOfText>
<human> Same here! I haven't picked one up yet, but I loved all the choices they made on it. Some true gems on there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my dog just graduated from his obedience course at his doggy school thing. I'm proud of him. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow congrats! what kind of dog is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad that someone stole my car. <endOfText>
<human> Holy heck, just like right out of the parking lot or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my doctor might be giving me the wrong meds. This is the third night in a row where I can't sleep <endOfText>
<human> Have you thought about getting a second opinion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to eat by myself last night, I have no friends. <endOfText>
<human> that's so sad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughter failed me <endOfText>
<human> What did she do to fail you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> she got pregnant at the age of 17 <endOfText>
<human> Did she have the baby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't understand why some people get paid so much more than others <endOfText>
<human> May be because of the talent they possess!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Valid point, Opportunity and skill sets are different <endOfText>
<human> Definitely - not all skills are rewarded equally. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is very nice to everyone she meets <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! She sounds very nice then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It might sound a bit silly, but I'm really down that this next season of Game of Thrones is going to be the last one. <endOfText>
<human> wow interesting <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am so ready to go to Japan. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was completely drenched <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you didn't have an umbrella. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when money used to be worth something. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My brother always takes my hot sauce. <endOfText>
<human> From your house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a meal at Whataburger yesterday. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I saw a guy put chocolate in his soup. <endOfText>
<human> Ew! That must have been so disgusting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving on a busy street and my brakes went out. There were so many cars I thought I was going to crash. I was so scared. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrifying! How fast were you travelling? How old was the car? What happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds terrifying! How fast were you travelling? How old was the car? What happened? <endOfText>
<human> I was able to use my emergency brake and avoid hitting anyone. It was touch and go though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How long have you been married for? I always thought I would be one of those people celebrating my 40 year anniversity. <endOfText>
<human> 4 years in October <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I was astounded as he practically stopped traffic to escort the old lady to the other side of the street. <endOfText>
<human> Were you? That must have impressed you a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was the most darling thing.  As I drove away I could easily see that the lady was smitten. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, we should strive to be like that person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through an old photo album. It brought back so many memories. <endOfText>
<human> I know how that could be, an old trip down memory lane can make you reflect on so much.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know how that could be, an old trip down memory lane can make you reflect on so much. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i found my nintendo entertainment system in my closet a few months ago <endOfText>
<human> was it a nice surprise? <endOfText>

<human> do you feel like you are ready to drive in real time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a pineapple upside down cake later. <endOfText>
<human> What do you have to make it for? Are you looking forward to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You cannot believe, what I just did. I wanted to surprise my friend at his new house, but I was at the wrong his. So instead, I surprised a complete stranger. <endOfText>
<human> That's so funny! How did they react when you did that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were surprised, I apologized and exited the house as fast as I can. My face was red. <endOfText>
<human> I would've been so embarrassed if that was me. At least you've got a funny story to tell people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that my girlfriend has cheated on me <endOfText>
<human> I feel sorry for you, how did you reacted ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a makeover and bought fashionable clothes for the date <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sound like a lot of fun!! Hope your date ended up being worth all that work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a high school teacher so of course the pressure is always on to keep them on track. I definitely broke the ice on the first day. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. Great teachers are always needed in this world. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somebody broke off the side mirror of my car. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh! Sounds like a problem. Can you find out who it was. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My firm planned a retirement party for me behind my back! <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice of them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really mad with my housemate last night. She got in really late and made loads of noise <endOfText>
<human> Oh that can be annoying! I guess in her defence it was a Saturday night? But still, it doesn't take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late! I hope you were able to sleep okay.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that can be annoying! I guess in her defence it was a Saturday night? But still, it doesn't take much effort to try to keep the noise down even if you do get in late! I hope you were able to sleep okay. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I agree, we both work shifts though so sometimes I have to work all of Saturday day and I always make sure to keep the noise down if she's had to work a Saturday. Thank you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog had to be put down the other day. I'm heart broken <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. <endOfText>

<human> How did it go? Did you get the job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a scary call from my nieces earlier this week. Apparently no matter what they did, they could not awaken her from her sleep. <endOfText>

<human> Not cool! Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I emptied an entire cookie jar against the doctor's orders. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother wont stop making fun of my pimple since morning. Ugh! <endOfText>
<human> That must be so frustrating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, and annoying because he wont be quiet and keeps making fun of me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope he stops soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to go to a writing conference. It is a huge and allows you to meet so many people. Unfortunately, something else came up and I had to cancel. I felt so bad that I wouldn't be able to go. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry that you couldnt go as I can see this was so important to you.  Why did you have to cancel?  Must have been something important come up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We thought we were going to have to move at the exact same time. It turns out we didn't move after all! But it still would've been hard because it was so expensive. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry you that happend to you.  DO you write books? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone threw away my lunch at work. <endOfText>
<human> Was your name on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I think they did it on purpose. It makes me so mad thinking about it. <endOfText>
<human> Have you had issues with this worker before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex already found someone else. I can not believe it! <endOfText>
<human> Were you guys married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got my dream job, but was so nervous about starting it. Going into a male dominated world as a young female can be scary. <endOfText>
<human> Good on you for taking that stand! You must be very proud of yourself  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good on you for taking that stand! You must be very proud of yourself <endOfText>
<human> I am. It still is a little overhwleming some days like, Wow I'm really here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really impressed by how well Croatia did in the World Cup this year. I didn't expect them to reach the final! <endOfText>
<human> I don't really follow soccer, but it always cool for an underdog to do well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got a promotion at work! <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember going fishing with my dad. <endOfText>

<human> Oh, no I"m sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, no I"m sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<human> Its okay. I called the cleaning company because I was so disgusted by the smell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the best days of my life where the day my children were born. <endOfText>
<human> Yep those are the most exciting times of life.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep those are the most exciting times of life. <endOfText>
<human> I didn't think I could have children it took forever to get pregnant so to hold them in my arms once born was magical. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a new Range Rover. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Is it very nice? I've never been in one of those before.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great. Is it very nice? I've never been in one of those before. <endOfText>
<human> They are so nice!  I am so envious of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter sang in a chorus concert. She did so well. She has a beautiful voice. <endOfText>
<human> She must have a lovely voice! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She does! She is only twelve, but she really sings nicely. She loves to sing. <endOfText>
<human> You must be a great parent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was strange noise from the kitchen at night. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have your alarm on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but it didnt ring. I was spooked but it turned out I had left the window open and it was the wing. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I would have thought maybe an animal had gotten in <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever get your hopes up over a job that you just knew was yours. <endOfText>
<human> Yes one time. I was feeling very hopeful that day. Have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember back when I was deployed to Iraq. It was some lonely nights, I tell you. <endOfText>
<human> How long were you deployed for. And thank you for your service. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any animals? I just had to put mine down <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, I'm sorry! I have a dog and two cats. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend bought me a new phone! <endOfText>
<human> Cool!  Getting a new phone is like Christma! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents planned a welcoming party for me when I returned from college without telling me! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's nice of them!  I hope you had a good time at the party! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did! I met my old friends and drank wine all night. It was a nice surprise. <endOfText>
<human> Ooo wine, a classy bunch of folk you are! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife can write really well, and she just wrote this article on networking. <endOfText>
<human> I seem you must be quite proud of her for writing on such a subject. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think today is going to be a good day. <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope so. Why do you think that it will be a good day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a competition show on television in which people were competing to be on Broadway. They were amazing! They could sing and dance so beautifully! <endOfText>
<human> You must have been so impressed. They must have been quite talented. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were unbelievable. They were also so attractive - just really stunning. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I could dance like that! Too bad I am only good with computers! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The airplane smelled like it had not been cleaned. And I had a 8 hour flight non-stop. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds awful! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to put together an IKEA drawer later. <endOfText>
<human> Are you good at doing flatpack DIY? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met up with old school friends the other day. It was for the first time in about 15 years <endOfText>
<human> That must have been exciting.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must have been exciting. <endOfText>
<human> It was lovely <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had to lose a pet? <endOfText>
<human> I have. It's definitely awful. It's much like losing a family member. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a meal at Chili's last night. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a good moment you had. What did you take as your meal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to having donuts later. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited about something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my five year old daughter <endOfText>
<human> Why would you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever lived alone? <endOfText>
<human> Yes and it was the worst experience of my life. Have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been training for months for the race! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what is the race? Sounds like a lot of work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its a 100m sprint. Its a lot work but it has helped me prepare well. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure all the work will be worth it in the end! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old concert t-shirt from a concert I went too in highschool. <endOfText>
<human> Cool! What style of music?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cool! What style of music? <endOfText>
<human> Deftones. They're an "alt metal" band <endOfText>

<human> Ha. Was it geice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been so scared at night that your bascially frozen to your bed? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it is terrifying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't get much done either because I have 3 kids that always seem to need something or got somewhere. <endOfText>
<human> That's frustrating. How on earth do you ever get something done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever have one of those moments where it's supposed to be very challenging, but then it seems like you've been ready for it for years? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it's like that all the time for me.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it's like that all the time for me. <endOfText>
<human> I felt like that when I took my boards to become a PA. I blew through that test in record time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my mother's purse. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, goodness. Why did you do such a thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The government is increasing taxes again. They keep increasing taxes without explain why. Most of our taxes are stolen by them. <endOfText>
<human> Excatly! I would love to know what they spend it all on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother got very sick and there was no one else to take care of her. <endOfText>

<human> Yeah I guess that happens every once in a while.  Something you went through recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you enjoy high school? <endOfText>
<human> Not particularly. I wasn't my best self at that time. I suppose who really is, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to go to craft fairs. The best one of the year was coming up. I couldn't wait to go. <endOfText>
<human> You must be really excited for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my coworker handle my project when I was on sick leave. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of them to chip in. It must have felt good that you had someone to help.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, I felt really trusting of him and he did really well. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. It makes all the difference to have people you can trust, especially when you are not feeling well.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That was nice of them to chip in. It must have felt good that you had someone to help. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I felt really trusting of him and he did really well.  <endOfText>

<human> That's great. How big is the bonus going to be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am drug addict. I didn't pay my drug dealer. He came last week to ask for his money. <endOfText>
<human> oh no! Is everything ok? I hope he didnt scare you <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Have you ever had a really sick pet? <endOfText>
<human> No, do you have one really sick pet? <endOfText>

<human> Are you serious? Why wouldn't you pay him back. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my friend at the bar yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Did he do something bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister let us know she was going to have a baby! Her other kids are a lot older so we weren't expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been quite the surprise.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were shocked to be honest. Then she ended up having two more, one right after the next! <endOfText>
<human> That is so crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must have been quite the surprise. <endOfText>
<human> We were shocked to be honest. Then she ended up having two more, one right after the next!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man eat a three foot sub. <endOfText>
<human> Was he a competition eater? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad got my brother a watch but not me! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! you must be sad. have you been bad lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea I am sad and jealous of my brother. I didnt even do anything bad! <endOfText>
<human> I can see how your frustrated. Maybe you can talk to your dad about it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its always exciting to come to the end of a programme succesfully <endOfText>
<human> A workout program? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can honeslty say for the first time in my life, I'm 100% comfortable with who I am. <endOfText>

<human> Oh no! Hopefully you're able to get it all fixed up so you can use it again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were going on a vacation for a week. I have five kids so I put out every single day of clothing in its own bag. I was very organized. <endOfText>
<human> You must be excited. packing can be hectic. thank god you are organized.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is stressful because I am always worried about forgetting something. But it makes it easier when you are there. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. You should double check everything to make sure its there. It will help with the worry and anxiousness about it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You must be excited. packing can be hectic. thank god you are organized. <endOfText>
<human> It is stressful because I am always worried about forgetting something. But it makes it easier when you are there.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've spent my entire life dedicated to this one thing <endOfText>
<human> And what was this thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally finished my PhD thesis. I have worked for 3 years on it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Congrats, I know the process my husband did one. What is your on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfathers prized Cadillac car caught fire the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Is it a total loss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is. I am absolutely devastated that is gone forever. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to replace it with a similar year/model? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend delayed our lunch plans again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, why can't they just set a time and commit to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have lost my job recently, My friend is helping me and providing me support. <endOfText>
<human> Well that sucks but at least it seems like you have a decent support system? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned a party for my sister, and was excited about doing it for her. <endOfText>
<human> Did everything went as planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new Tesla drove 4 miles on autopilot by itself! <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats amazing. You must be excited and full of joy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a restaurant recently where the waiter refused to wait on a black couple <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. It's a shame that there's still racist people in 2018! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We spent a day at a local nature park. It was so nice and relaxing. Being outdoors is just so pleasant. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I litke that too. Do you do that frequently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not as much as I would like. We have five kids so we are always running around with their activities. <endOfText>
<human> I understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to energency last week. They took my clothes. When I left the energency, I got my clothes back and I found that all the money that was in my wallet was gone. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful! You should file a complaint! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really dont want to sell my old Cadillac. But I need the money. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I hope you won't be out of transportation <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea I will get a cheaper car. It just that I am so sentimentally attached to the Cadillac. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! They're really cool cars with personality <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a child, my parents would take us on a big road trip to Disneyland. I was looking at pictures this week and those were some great memories. I wish I could go back to that time! <endOfText>
<human> Oh those definitely sound like some good memories! At least you have some pictures. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it was such a simpler time. Being an adult sucks so much ha ha! I guess I should plan a road trip like that with my own children. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure they would enjoy that quite a bit. They can make memories just like you did. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped and fell face first at a bar last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hurt my elbow a little over a month ago, but I thought it was almost back to being 100% again. <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear you're feeling better again.  How did you hurt it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Many of my friends were invited to a party. I felt very left out as I sat at home. I always invite everyone. <endOfText>
<human> I feel for you,but dont take it the hard way,its well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to focus on other things instead. <endOfText>
<human> Thats what you should do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People that are honest are honest are hard to come by these days <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you have had back luck. There are some honest people out there.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry you have had back luck. There are some honest people out there. <endOfText>
<human> That is true but some people are just insincere <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter got into the university program of her choice. <endOfText>
<human> That is a really exciting time. You must be so proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy for her. I hope it leads to a fulfilling career. <endOfText>
<human> I know it's hard when they first go off for college, but it sounds like you raised her well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am submitting a proposal for a manuscript to an editor. I am hoping she will publish it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's amazing! Is it a novel?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is! A light romance about a horse rescue. <endOfText>
<human> How long did it take to write? I always admire the stamina of people who can write a book.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's amazing! Is it a novel? <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is! A light romance about a horse rescue.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was visiting a high school for my job recently and I slipped and fell in the hallway with many students watching. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry. I hope you weren't hurt! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just my pride! It was so embarrassing! There were definitely some giggles. <endOfText>
<human> That's okay. It happens to everyone!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's okay. It happens to everyone! <endOfText>
<human> I had to go home and have a glass of wine to shake the humiliation!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a stupid mistake at work. Because of that mistake, I was fired. I am angry at myself. <endOfText>
<human> I know it's a blow, but you're only human. Everybody makes mistakes sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been jobless for 14 months. Last week, I finally got a job. I am so happy. <endOfText>
<human> I'm very happy for you, thank God you could get a job, that's good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is very happy and loving, they make me feel very happy. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. How many brothers and sisters do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the past, I was jobless for 14 months. So now, I am putting a lot of money in my savings in case this happened again. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a real example of learning from the past. sorry you had to go through that. are you better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the race track. Since we used to go there with my grandparents, it brought back a lot of memories. <endOfText>
<human> That's so funny, I was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday! I love races- if you are talking about horse races. And good memories are the best.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were the horse races. My grandparents went twice a week. <endOfText>
<human> Did they used to take you? They can be so exciting.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's so funny, I was just looking at the racing schedule yesterday! I love races- if you are talking about horse races. And good memories are the best. <endOfText>
<human> They were the horse races. My grandparents went twice a week.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont like being taken unawares,so i get them ready befor time <endOfText>
<human> So you definitely believe in the old adage: fail to prepare and you prepare to fail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My next store neighbor brought me dinner yesterday evening. <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice of them! What did they bring you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sounds delicious! What a good friend. <endOfText>
<human> She's an old grandma and I go help her out sometimes.   So she'll cook some extra for me on occasion. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We took the kids to Lion Country Safari. They had a lot of fun. It was just nice to be there with them and let them have fun. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun. Did you see any lions? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! We always see them there! <endOfText>
<human> What else do you see besides lioins? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker just bought a new BMW 335. That is my dream car! I wish I had is so bad! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is a very expensive car! Did they win the lottery or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My landlord has not fixed a leaky tap in my apartment even though I've asked 4 times. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good.  Can't you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak?  I would be really mad!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, my next step might be to call the tenant board. It's costing me a lot to lose so much water, not to mention it's wasteful. <endOfText>
<human> That is true about the waste.  I would sue for compensation.  I think the law is on your side regarding this issue. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's not good.  Can't you withhold if they refuse to fix the leak?  I would be really mad! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, my next step might be to call the tenant board. It's costing me a lot to lose so much water, not to mention it's wasteful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some financial problems. I finally paid all my debts. It is a big relief. I am so happy. <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  That is a big worry off your shoulders I'm sure.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great.  That is a big worry off your shoulders I'm sure. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, now I think about the future. That is nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out the other day that I am a finalist for a promotion at work.  It made me feel excited and good about the future <endOfText>
<human> That is great. They noticed you because you are doing a good job, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure think that is the case.   Feel very positive about my chances <endOfText>
<human> Good luck with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She felt so left out <endOfText>
<human> who felt left out? I'm confued? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got home from vacation and there was an awful stench in my house.  Turns out I forgot to take the trash out before I left <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's not fun! I hope it cleared when you took it out!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I finally realized what it was, I took out the trash then lit every candle I have and opened the windows <endOfText>
<human> It should have cleared it. I once left bread for two weeks when I went home for winter vacation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's not fun! I hope it cleared when you took it out! <endOfText>
<human> When I finally realized what it was, I took out the trash then lit every candle I have and opened the windows  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter entered a hula hoop contest with a lot of kids. She won first prize! <endOfText>

<human> Wow, congratulations! Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In garage, there is a lot cockroachs. We all complained to the landlord but he is doing nothing about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's not right! You could probably complain anonymously to the city.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's not right! You could probably complain anonymously to the city. <endOfText>
<human> I will try that but I am thinking about moving. I can't live in such disgusting place anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I had my first baby, it was amazing. I was just so happy and joyful that I had been given this blessing. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. How many childrens do you have now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I looked at my pay-stub online and noticed I got a raise today! I couldn't believe it. I've only been there 3 months so it felt good to get noticed for my work ethic and performance. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Good job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I go out with one of my friend. This friend is so cheap that he doesn't to pay for anything. He even once embarrassed me in a bar. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds frustrating, especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds. They sound kind of entitled. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on a camping trip next weekend! I have my bags and supplies all packed and ready to go. I think I am all set and ready for anything! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope you have lots of fun and don't get too bitten by mosquitoes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a party and I asked a girl for a date. She rejected me and told almost everyone in the party. <endOfText>
<human> Wow.  That was uncalled for.  I am sorry to hear about that.  Sounds like she is not someone you would want to date anyway <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the grocery store the other day.  When I got out I noticed someone dented my car with a cart! <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. How much did it cost you to fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up really wanting some coffee... turns out my coffee machine isn't working. What a morning <endOfText>
<human> Oh NO! It can be annoying especially early mornings at work with no coffee. Hope you stay away! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was such a bad thunderstorm last night that the power went out <endOfText>
<human> That's not good! I'm assuming they got it back on for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to go to the zoo this afternoon. <endOfText>
<human> I be you cant wait! Seeing exotic animals is so exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We spent a lot of money on pizza. The order was all wrong. They were very rude to us when we called them. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awful! Did they fix the order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think it ever came out right. They really messed up. <endOfText>
<human> I don't think I would ever order from that place again! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I just celebrated our ninth wedding anniversary. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice... almost a decade! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm meeting a girl for a date at the zoo this afternoon. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome first date! Hopefully it goes well for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bit of a situation with my cat lately, he went missing for 2 days! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my.  I bet you were a nervous wreck.  How did you find your cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My air and heating guy came over for a routine check on the systems.  He told me I needed a whole new Air Conditioner Unit.  I was not too happy <endOfText>
<human> That's awful! Especially in the middle of summer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a call this morning letting me know I won a new rifle in a raffle I entered. <endOfText>
<human> that's amazing  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that's amazing <endOfText>
<human> I've entered a bunch of those. Finally won one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im not about that I have to give my spot to someone else <endOfText>
<human> You have to give your spot to someone else? What do you mean exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently applied to medical school.  I really want to be a surgeon <endOfText>
<human> That is great!  Are you nervous about whether or not you will get into med school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat just scratched up my brand new leather couch while I was at work! I am so mad at him right now I could scream! <endOfText>
<human> That's frustrating!  We have cat scratching posts EVERYWHERE to try to avoid that, but still had to put the sticky tape on the couch to prevent scratching <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to St. Augustine when I was a child. When we went back again, I really enjoyed it, especially because I kept remembering what it was like when I was a child. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a nice big breakfast... I feel good! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, I love breakfast! What did you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just played her first soccer game and did really well. She did great! <endOfText>
<human> You must be proud.  Did her team win the game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up this morning and my truck had a flat tire. <endOfText>
<human> That is the worst!  Did you have somewhere you needed to be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing too important... I was gonna go get breakfast.  I guess I'm not doing that now. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks!  Hopefully you are not to mad because of it.  Flat tires happen to the best of us! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm planning to buy a house in 2 years. Right now we live in a small apartment but i really want a nice house with a big backyard! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds wonderful! I'm sure you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thank you! I've been working really hard for the past 3 years so i hope we will find a right house <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will get there, I meant to say. Don't rush or settle and I am sure you will find something perfect. We bought our first house on Friday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The local community theater put on a play. They did an amazing job! <endOfText>
<human> Great! What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw The Little Mermaid. It was so sweet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how cool! Did you go alone or with your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to make breakfast and dropped the egg carton on accident... all the eggs broke. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to settle for bacon and toast only. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear. Well next time you are at the store, get two cartons! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I am sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<human> I had to settle for bacon and toast only.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We live in an area that gets hurricanes. When one was coming, we got flashlights, batteries and everything you need. <endOfText>
<human> its always good to be prepared. I live in an area that gets hurricanes too.  I've even got a generator.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its always good to be prepared. I live in an area that gets hurricanes too.  I've even got a generator. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. We lost power for a week during one and it was horrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out and realized that my dress was pulled up in the back. Everyone could see far too much! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I have had that happen too! It was very embarrassing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out of town on a business trip and felt very isolated.  I did not know anyone and had no one to hang out with. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry you had that experience. When I was traveling cross-country, I used to FaceTime or Skype friends and family. Would that work for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just graduated with her MBA. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on that. What are her plans now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a Facebook post depicting suffering Syrian children that my friend shared on Facebook. I feel so sad for those innocent kids <endOfText>
<human> That's very sad.  Are you planning on going to syria to help them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so ready for my presentation at work tomorrow. I'm sure I'll do great! <endOfText>
<human> You must have prepared yourself for this! You will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning, I went out to get my paper and a cougar was in my front yard.  I darn near dropped my coffee cup! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been scary! How are you feeling? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won some money on the lottery lately, enough to pay for a holiday for myself! <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  Was it a scratcher ticket? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a coworker that comes into work late every day and takes way too many breaks <endOfText>
<human> How frusterating! Have you brought it up to management <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can tell the frusteration in your tone. I would go above your supervisor since nothing has been done. Otherwise you will stay frustrated and angry. <endOfText>
<human> it won't help anything because management is so nonchalant about discplinary action at my job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a rollercoaster tomorrow and I haven't been on one in ages! <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A boy was being agressive with my son in the bounce house He was twice as large! His parent wasn't supervising! <endOfText>
<human> I hate when parents don't keep tabs on their kids, especially when they are misbehaving!  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just applied for financing on a new car. My credit is not well established, but I am praying that I get approved! <endOfText>
<human> I wish you the best of luck!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank!  I really need the car to get to work! <endOfText>
<human> There are many types of loans out there, so hopefully you get one! It will also help you build your credit.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave a proposal to an agent. I was hoping she would like it and agree to represent me. <endOfText>
<human> I bet your anxious to know what happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They say unreal things atimes <endOfText>
<human> Who says unreal things?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Who says unreal things? <endOfText>
<human> Some people say things that are not real <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate breakfast and did all my chores. Now I can relax for the rest of the day. <endOfText>
<human> Relaxation is very needful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing the number of disagreements only to increase between two major parties in our country, i am afraid of our future political discourse <endOfText>
<human> Yeah its very nervwrecking. Im anxious as well to know how it turns out.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah its very nervwrecking. Im anxious as well to know how it turns out. <endOfText>
<human> It is truly. It has not been like this before. I only see and hear insults flying around at each other address <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran my first 50 mile race a couple of months ago. <endOfText>
<human> That must have taken some preparation! How did you feel afterwards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While shopping the other day, I had to show my ID to purchase some glue. I'm glad I keep my ID on me. <endOfText>
<human> An ID for glue? What's next, showing ID for buying a greeting card? Sheesh. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate sitting around doing nothing. it drives me nuts to do nothing at work when i have a million things to do at home <endOfText>
<human> Know the feeling. I had one job where I spent all day either playing cards or working online, just to relieve the boredom! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the casino last weekend and on my first pull of the slot machine, I won 1,000 dollars! <endOfText>
<human> WHOA! That's awesome! I've never won anything in my life lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had such a sweet little parakeet and i was always letting him fly in the house. One day i opened the window and i totally forgot my bird was out of the cage and he flew away <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did you ever find him again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A blossom friend we lost contact for 10years now <endOfText>
<human> Why did you lose contact? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent last evening completely alone <endOfText>
<human> Why alone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so excited to go out to dinner tonight! I bought a new dress and shoes and I can't wait to wear them. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun Who are you going with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really looking forward to New Year's. We go to a celebration at a restaurant and then cook lots of great food. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds like fun! What types of food do you cook? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For New Year's, we make all sorts of little appetizers. It's the stuff we normally wouldn't splurge on. <endOfText>
<human> Food always makes the party!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really took a trip down memory lane recently! I went to my 10 year high school reunion! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How content you must feel about it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The anniversary of my father's death recently passed. I'm still adjusting to things without him. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Losing family can be, and is, very tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went online to pay my internet bill today and their payment system was offline. I was so let down. <endOfText>
<human> The irony that the internet bill could not be paid online is kind of funny.  But I can see how that would be a let down and inconvenient. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going bungee jumping next weekend.  I am pretty nervous and do not know what to expect. <endOfText>
<human> Whew, you're braver than I am. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi there! I had something pretty interesting happen recently. It made me really think about how much things have changed over the last couple of decades. <endOfText>
<human> Really, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It truly seems that all my friends have a much better husband than I do. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure that is definitely not true. What makes you think that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my birthday coming up next week and my co-workers are expecting me to throw a party at my house. I am so stressed about it as it will be my first time inviting them over <endOfText>
<human> Being anxious is normal! Be yourself and you will be just fine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i go to work all my co workers always talk about other women even though they are all married. they always laugh at me when i say i don't care about other women because i love my wife <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that! Are they trying to shame or embarrass you about something.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im sorry to hear that! Are they trying to shame or embarrass you about something. <endOfText>
<human> they just say that men can't be faithful, that all of us cheat and stuff like that. It's not true! I mean i really can't imagine cheating on my wife <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I had to go and get some legos for my nephew.  A very strange emotion kinda overcame me in the aisle at Target. <endOfText>
<human> Were you embarrassed or what happend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I got into a fight this morning. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel very optimistic about where my life is headed. The future is bright! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. What do you have going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, my dog ate rat poisoning on accident and ended up dying. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's terrible! I'm sorry you had to go through that. Pets are our family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm eating lobster for the first time this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest daughter is suffering with allergies this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's bad. Did she take any medicine? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They gave me a surprise birthday party for me <endOfText>
<human> Really? That was cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an award at my place of work <endOfText>
<human> Thats so good,am happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. I was a week vacation, all expense paid <endOfText>
<human> Wao,you are so favoured,are u back already? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated at cards. <endOfText>
<human> Did you feel bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My gold fish past away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no - what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I"ve got some big medical tests coming up. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully you do good on those and the doctor clears you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was planning to go to work today and when i got closer to my car i noticed a snake. nope, not today. came back home and called off work today <endOfText>
<human> What was a snake doing there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother's wife told me not to come her house again for just no reason <endOfText>
<human> what? why would she say that? that's mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really mean. She is planning something weird <endOfText>
<human> like what? you think she wanna do something bad to you or your brother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no one to read with. <endOfText>
<human> You don't like reading alone?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You don't like reading alone? <endOfText>
<human> It would just be nice to have someone else around every once and awhile. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my best friend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that, you seem upset about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left some food in the microwave on accident while I left my house to take a trip. <endOfText>
<human> There will surely be maggots on that when you get home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Olives are just gross to eat and look at. <endOfText>
<human> I agree!  Especially the green ones. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when I was a little kid, I sucked up a spider through a straw.  I guess it had been living in there. <endOfText>
<human> I would have cried for hours. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People actually eat pizza? <endOfText>
<human> I love pizza!  What is you favorite type? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been exercising and dieting for the last year regularly! I feel really good about how I look and am really self assured! <endOfText>
<human> I try to eat the most junk food possible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away from home. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is terrible. I've had that happen once. Did you find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog got very sick the other day and had to go to the vet. <endOfText>
<human> Did the vet fix the dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kids need to stay away from me, they are too loud! <endOfText>
<human> That's funny! I agree and it's worse when they aren't your kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was so relaxing and contenting to watch my kids play on the waterslide while I grilled yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I would have had a great time eating your food. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a great movie last night, all snuggled up while drinking hot chocolate. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a good night. What movie was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at a fancy restaurant the other night and the quality of the food was awful. So mad I paid that much for it. <endOfText>
<human> That happens more often that you might think. Just because it's expensive doesn't mean it's any good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm annoyed that many things are still closed on Sundays...like the federal reserve banking system. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, I hate that too. It's so inconvenient to be closed when people have time to go there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when my friends threw me a surprise birthday party. It was so much fun. <endOfText>
<human> yea have fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Am so thankful to Him for the breath of life <endOfText>
<human> Indeed. Are you religious then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait until we go on vacation next year1 <endOfText>
<human> i bet! I wanna go on vacation too! it's been a while. where are you guys going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> these contractors are fixing the roof and they are so messy and not professional. they are already loud enough banging on the roof all day long but they also turn on their music super loud like banging is not loud enough <endOfText>
<human> Wow - can you ask them to tone it down at all?  That would drive me crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> that's good to have friends you can count on! what kind of party are you having? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew the football team would win tonight! <endOfText>
<human> That always makes it a great night when your team wins! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend always has my back. <endOfText>
<human> It is always good to have a friend who can take your hand in times of need. I wish I had more of that type of friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thankful for achieving the amount I had planned to save for the end of this month. I was able to cut on unnecessary spending <endOfText>
<human> I need to start saving more money honestly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooed all over the floor. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I absolutely hate it when that happens!   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh, I absolutely hate it when that happens! <endOfText>
<human> I thought about getting rid of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby was up in the middle of the night last night, he's teething <endOfText>
<human> That must be very painful for both him and you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gave him some Tylenol, and we ended up snuggling til he could go back to sleep. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds better than I had thought. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe my paycheck wont come in the mail this month. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good.  Why do you think it won't come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on a week long vacation next month.  I am really excited and cannot wait! <endOfText>
<human> I wish i could afford a vacation like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Jesus will come home and save us all one day. <endOfText>
<human> Yes he will.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes he will. <endOfText>
<human> He is the only reason i wake up in the mornings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get nostalgic thinking about my grandmother <endOfText>
<human> Is she still with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No she passed about 6 years ago. I have little things around my house that remind me of her. <endOfText>
<human> She will always be with you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why does everyone else have nicer cloths than me? <endOfText>
<human> Maybe they just have better taste? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the beach and this guy did a double backflip from just the ground. I was amazed <endOfText>
<human> I would have cried right there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandparents always gave me toys that I keep to this day. <endOfText>
<human> So what do you have for example ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need the federal reserve bank to be open 24/7. <endOfText>
<human> why is that exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My diet seems to work for me. <endOfText>
<human> Ok,how do u combine it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They dont wait for their turn <endOfText>
<human> I am very confused, i hope one day they will. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband has been studying for over a year for this exam he needed to take.  It's taken a lot of time away from our family. <endOfText>
<human> That must be very hard for you all, but I'm sure it will be worth it in the end. What's the exam for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am totally lost. I had been from my job of 4 years. I have not much savings and don't know what to do now <endOfText>
<human> Ouch!  That is not good!  Think of the bright side though.  Better opportunities may present themselves to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband forgot to let the dog back inside when I was at work. <endOfText>
<human> Was your dog ok? I hope it didn't run away. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took money from my family. <endOfText>
<human> you mean you stole it or they gave it to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up in the middle of the night yesterday thinking something had crawled on me. <endOfText>
<human> I would have screamed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother has nicer shoes than me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a show off. Would you say they are nicer by a large margin? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very close to my mom and my grandma. they passed away a couple of years ago. I have so many great memories <endOfText>
<human> I'm really sorry for your loss. At least they still live on through your memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so funny. People say I should go into comedy. They also say I might be the next Rodney Dangerfield! <endOfText>
<human>  i don't think i know who Rodney Dangerfield is but hey, good for you! it's awesome when people have a good sense of humor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i don't think i know who Rodney Dangerfield is but hey, good for you! it's awesome when people have a good sense of humor <endOfText>
<human> He is probably one of the greatest comedians of all time. His signature phrase was "I don't get no respect" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep all of my pictures with my family. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. Do you have a photo album you keep them in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started going back to the gym recently and I was so anxious the first day that I was going to look stupid! <endOfText>
<human> The gym always hurts my body when i go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car has never been dirtier. <endOfText>
<human> Well, it's time for a wash then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This Summer has seemed very short to me this year. <endOfText>
<human> Summer flys by, i hope winter lasts a long time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied all year for my driver test. <endOfText>
<human> Seems like you were well prepared, did you pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> DId you get out and kick them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to stay to myself as no one talks to me ever. <endOfText>
<human> i am looking forward to trying to get pregnant by the end of the year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are going to Disney world in December! <endOfText>
<human> i'm sorry. i know how that feels. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray in the church. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great for you! Some people say that praying helps solve anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have anyone to talk to. It can get pretty quiet in this big house I live in <endOfText>
<human> I'll always talk to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why thank you. You are such a good friend. <endOfText>
<human> I'll always be for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one day i was coming back home and i saw a tiny little kitten under the stair. i brought him home. he couldn't even walk yet! I got some kitten formula and i fed him and took care of him and now he grew up into a very awesome cat! <endOfText>
<human> Do you still have the cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yup, he is 2 years old now. he is gorgeous! and he is the most loving cat. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! I'm glad you kept him around! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my toe on the side of my bed this morning, it's still hurting! <endOfText>
<human> i hate when that happens! I stub my toes all the time i'm surprised i didn't break none of them yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In a week Fall semester will start and I have registered for my classes. I am fully prepared to tackle this semester with great achievements <endOfText>
<human> I wish you the best of luck, study hard and you'll do well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied really hard for my last colllege final and I got the 2nd highest score in the class! <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. What class was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I celebrated the winter holidays with family and friends. It was so wonderful to see everyone, enjoy yummy food and exchange gifts. <endOfText>
<human> that sounds amazing. i haven't seen my family in almost 2 years <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's too bad. If you want, you can reach out to them. <endOfText>
<human> i do but they wont come visit and i can't afford to go visit <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sometimes i feel i have no one to turn to <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you join some groups so you can meet some new people.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that. Why don't you join some groups so you can meet some new people. <endOfText>
<human> there isnt very many.i live in a small town <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes you just have to reach out to people. Oftentimes other people are feeling the same way and you don't even realize it. <endOfText>
<human> i don't have much in common with the people around me here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was supposed to be a fun day with the family, but I guess it's just going to be a quiet day inside. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to cause the change. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting a promotion at work in February. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, I"m sure you've worked very hard for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today is going to be awesome! We are going to the lake to see all of our family! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun, will you be cooking stuff too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was a great lazy day.  I did nothing but sit outside in the sun and read a book.  It was completely happy <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a wonderful time. I wish I had the time for that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole from my parents and they caught me. I felt so bad as they yell at me. <endOfText>
<human> I would feel guilty too if I was in your shoes.  Did you feel bad because you stole or bad because you got caught? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad because I stole. I didn't even need the money I stole. <endOfText>
<human> Then why did you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It makes me feel good when I see my friends realizing their dreams. <endOfText>
<human> That is a great attitude to have and wonderful that you are so supportive of them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's nice because if they're happy, I'm happy. <endOfText>
<human> Some people get jealous when other people are doing well, so you are truely a good friend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so ready to start my last semester of college next week.. I'm prepared to get it over with and get a real job! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! I can say that it's agreat feeling to graduate.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome! I can say that it's agreat feeling to graduate. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so!  It's going to feel weird as well, all these years in school, finally finished. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend invited me to go on a cruise <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how exciting. Are you going to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won my first game today! <endOfText>
<human> That is great! What game did you play? Was it fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was using a quilt the other day and it reminded me of my great grandmother because she knitted it. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice.  Was the quilt passed down to you from her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out my garage and found an old picture of myself and my cousins from when we were kids.  It brought back some good memories. <endOfText>
<human> I know that nostalgic feeling. Time really flies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I got to my kitchen I almost throw up because my roommate is so messy. He is a pig! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds disgusting. Have you talked to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah but he just burpes and ignores me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I would be trying to find another place if I were you, or tell him to find one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big test coming up for my psychology class. <endOfText>
<human> That must be stressful! \ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Very much so! I'm just not sure how well I'm going to do. <endOfText>
<human> Well if you study hard I'm sure you will do fine.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i feel badly about wanting to have a child when we are not in a good place financially <endOfText>
<human> I can understand. Ultimately you don't have to be rich to have a kid though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost all of my money at the casino <endOfText>
<human> That is very irresponsible from your side. It is never wise to spend your hard earned money on such leisure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The friend I know received the highest score on physics final exam. To be honest, i was quite jealous and wanted to be in his place <endOfText>
<human> I love physics! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started going to the gym but I felt apprehensive when I first started. <endOfText>
<human> I didn't go to the gym forever! I know how you feel though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away from home! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, when did this happen? Do you think you'll find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pleased with how this weekend turned out, my family didn't cause me too much stress when they came over. <endOfText>
<human> My family was over all weekend and we had a blast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I just found out I am pregnant after years of trying! <endOfText>
<human> That's really great! I'm so happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so gulible. I will believe anything you say. <endOfText>
<human> I have had problems with that as well. I wish I had some advice to give. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too. I just have to spend a lot of time trying to figure out if someone is lying to me or not. <endOfText>
<human> Same here. And that can be very difficult, as you know! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stay away from the dark. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you do that? Are you scared of the dark? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I clean my kids room they go in and mess it up again. I am so ticked off at them. <endOfText>
<human> That is why you never have kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's annoying how is always scorching hot on your days off, but nice when you have to work inside all day! <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling! What you have to do is call in sick on a day that you're schedule to go in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine is a self-published writer. She put out 22 books this year! I can't believe how many she did. <endOfText>
<human> That is wild, I wish i could write and make money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am also a writer. I love it <endOfText>
<human> Maybe i will look into it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends organized a surprise birthday party for me last year! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! were you surprised? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really was, I had no idea! It was a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool, I'm glad you were surprised and had a blast! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad the weekend is almost over and I have to go back to work tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh yeah same. Did you have a nice weekend though?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh yeah same. Did you have a nice weekend though? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it was very relaxing, I chilled with my girlfriend and watched a lot of netflix. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog did great at training. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome , is your pet being trained at a store by chance ?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats awesome , is your pet being trained at a store by chance ? <endOfText>
<human> No, we have a professional doing it that works with the sheriff department. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate telemarketers. They call me all the time and I can't stand it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know, they are so annoying. You should try the Do Not Call list. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i believe in my heart no matter what i want all i have to do is put my mind to it and i'll be able to achieve it <endOfText>
<human> What is something that you have achieved by following your heart? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really impressed with the school play my 7th graders class put onm. <endOfText>
<human> oh how fun. what was the play about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really enjoy having pets. they bring a new life into an empty feeling house <endOfText>
<human> Yes I only have one dog but he's cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cam home form work and I was so shocked. My wife had cleaned the house. It was such a great presant! <endOfText>
<human> That is such a wonderful surprise. You may a great wife for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm worried my dog is sick. He has been moving around slow recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I hope that he pulls through! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told someone about my best friend's secret and I feel terribly bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, was it a big secret?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no, was it a big secret? <endOfText>
<human> It was. I'm scared to tell her I told someone, but I feel so bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you think she will ever find out without you telling her? <endOfText>
<human> Probably not, but my conscience won't let me not tell her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some guy cut me off in traffic while I had my daughter in the backseat, then proceeded to get out of his car and curse at me! <endOfText>
<human> Omg! Did you call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I did, because I was so mad that he was acting that way in front of my kid! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did the police arrest him or ticket him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am taking a trip to my hometown soon! <endOfText>
<human> Cool! Where are you from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every year, my wife continues to surprise me with something really cool. Last time, she bought me a switch! <endOfText>
<human> Nintendo Switch?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nintendo Switch? <endOfText>
<human> That's the one. She always surpasses my expectations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the days when my kids were younger. I was their hero and they just wanted to spend time with me. <endOfText>
<human> It is natural that kids grow up and want a little independence.  I know it happened with me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors decided to have a party last night and they played loud music until 1 AM.  It really got on my nerves. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet you wanted to over there and yell at them. Some people are so inconsiderate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> And this is not the first time either.  You are right, so people are very selfish and it is frusterating. <endOfText>
<human> If it is too bad you should file a noise complaint with the police. Sometimes that is the only way to get the message across. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my mom. She is always looking out for me and is the absolute best. <endOfText>
<human> Mom's are the best. I miss mine so much so enjoy every single moment you have with her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I most certainly will. <endOfText>
<human> I always try to be as good of a mom as my mom was to me. Hard shoes to fill. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All of my colleagues at work got together and threw a party for me due to a big contract I managed to snag. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awesome. The recognition must feel good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't complain about my life. I have everything I have ever wanted. Life is good. <endOfText>
<human> That is cool. You are very fortunate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Driving in traffic is such a frustration and in the city I live in there is always traffic. <endOfText>
<human> I live in the city too, I can't stand traffic either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It takes me 30 minutes to go a couple of miles! Sooo frustrating. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds even worse than my city! I'm sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When the hurricane came last year, I made sure to stock up on supplies and board all the windows. <endOfText>
<human> That's a smart thing to do! What hurricane was coming? I got hit by Irma pretty bad last year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> been  a long week finally a day off i feel so happy ...... and just like that my sisters asking me to take her to the mall lol , o well <endOfText>
<human> No rest for the weary I guess, huh? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife wanted something done at the house that required a special tool, so I went and asked my dad if he had the tool. <endOfText>
<human> I used to have a giant bag of tools but everything got stolen , what tool was it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to have a giant bag of tools but everything got stolen , what tool was it <endOfText>
<human> It was a belt sander, but instead of letting me borrow it, he just came over and did the job while I was at work!  What a guy... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest son just got a full ride to college. He is so smart and I'm so excited for him! <endOfText>
<human> Is it his first year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah he just graduated high school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow I bet you are proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad my girlfriend left me last week. I miss her terribly. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful to hear about. Were you guys together for a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend helped to calm me down as I went through a procedure at the doctor a few weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a good boyfriend! Did everything turn out ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a preseason football game the other night. I was impressed at how athletic the players are. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, What team was you watching ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a ghost in my house last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god. That's so scary! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to clean out my attic and found a dead rat. It was so gross. <endOfText>
<human> Disgusting! I hate rodents! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love when I come home and my cat is looking out the window waiting for me. <endOfText>
<human> I love cats! Does your cat like to snuggle with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Earlier this year my mom got really sick and ended up in the hospital. I feel like I should have been more vigilant about her health. <endOfText>
<human> So sorry to hear about your Mom - I do hope she's better now. In my personal experience, you can watch and advise all you like, but they often won't listen - my Mom was like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, that's true, they won't always listen. Still I can't help but beat myself up about it, and feel like I could have done more. I'm trying to get past the feeling of guilt, but it's hard. <endOfText>
<human> Please don't be so hard on yourself. It's sometimes hard to remind ourselves that our parents are people in their own right and, while we care very much about them, at the end of the day they'll do what they think is right. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you so much for your comforting words. At least she is doing a bit better now. I guess I have to accept that there is only so much I can do. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly! You have to do your thing and she has to do hers. Just by being there if she needs help, you're doing so much for her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend really helped me out by letting me borrow money when I was struggling. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, it's very useful to have a friend who can bail you out in a time of need. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've started training people at work, which would have made me nervous a year or two ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's great because you really grew as a person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not eating doughnuts was part of my diet. <endOfText>
<human> Lol that's a really good thing to not have in a diet! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss accused me of messing up on a project when it wasn't my fault! <endOfText>
<human> Did he give you a chance to tell your side of the story? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to hang out with friends at dinner last night after a long week at work. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so fun and relaxing! Did you enjoy yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss when I was young and living at home with my parents. They spoiled me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that you are missing them.Maybe you can go home and see them soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new car and I was really shocked by how it handles. Best car ever! <endOfText>
<human> Great to hear. I love the new car smell. Take good care of it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeha I certainly will. It's like my child now. <endOfText>
<human> Hope it lasts a long time for you. I am sure you will enjoy it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a speech at work and I forgot what I was going to say. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's an extremely common thing to happen. Did you recover? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stood there mute for a full 3 minutes before having to step away unfortunately. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. You'll get it next time I'm sure! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally tripped while walking into a restaurant for dinner, totally ruined my appetite. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I'm so sorry. <endOfText>
<human> It's alright, I was fine, just my pride was hurt haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a really good life. A nice house, car and wife makes me feel like I have it all! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, you probably worked very hard so you deserve it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really have. It all seems like a good reward for the life I've lived. <endOfText>
<human> I'm definitely a bit jealous, guess I need to work harder. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It shocked me the first time my boyfriend told me he loved me. <endOfText>
<human> Awe! Was that recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My work has been going very well lately. I'm up for a promotion. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What kind of job is it? Are you going to be a manager? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a well done steak at Outback Steakhouse, and they brought it to me raw and bleeding. <endOfText>
<human> I boarded a flight to my destination, while on board I requested a particular drink ,and it was declined <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She was not polite <endOfText>
<human> Who was not polite? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone at work was sitting together eating lunch and talking but they didn't invite me. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible of them! I would sit with you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so supised when I was making my cereal this morning. Something was in my cereal. <endOfText>
<human> What was in there?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been happy with the way things have been going lately. <endOfText>
<human> That's Awesome. Did you change anything lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a jacket the other day which I wanted for ages only to get it and not like it in person <endOfText>
<human> OH no! Can you return it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everytime I look at old family photos I get really sentimental. <endOfText>
<human> It's always nice to look back on old memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is the absolute best. I'm so luck to have her. <endOfText>
<human> I agree mothers are great. I appreciate mine as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah and she did so much for me when I was younger tooo. <endOfText>
<human> They make so many sacrifices for us. I love to spoil mine on Mother's Day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our dog is getting older and having issues. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. I know what that is like unfortunately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I frequently curl up with a good book to relax. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I love to read as well.  Especially during a rain next to a window. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes i felt prepare <endOfText>
<human> When did you feel prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone cut me off in traffic the other day. <endOfText>
<human> ohh its very seek <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had this girlfriend who i caught playing me with this other guy right? so i turned her in for warrents and the other guy got the blame from the cops <endOfText>
<human> wow this sounds like a crazy situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I changed my sons diaper the other day, when he said he just had to pee. <endOfText>
<human> thats cool, dont need a diaper rash <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah but within five minutes of putting his diaper back on, he unloaded the poo everywhere. <endOfText>
<human> thats usually what happens, lol.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read the best book the other day! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What was the name of the book? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear stange noises every time I try to go to sleep in my new noise. <endOfText>
<human> You mean new house? Did you find it for sale really cheap? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did find it for sale really cheap. And they were in a real hurry to sell it. <endOfText>
<human> Hmm, perhaps it means something really bad happened there. I would give the Ghostbusters a call. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so ticked off when I see people leave their shopping carts in the parking lot. How lazy are these people! <endOfText>
<human> That is very true! I dono't understand why people doe that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Krispy Kreme recently and got some donuts while the hot light was on. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not familiar with the hot light term, what does that mean exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> It's great to be able to have that trust and bond. Did everything go well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my old girlfriend. I felt so guilty afterwards. <endOfText>
<human> On no! Did you ever tell her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to tell my son the other day that our dog wasn't going to be with us anymore. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. I hope it wasn't too hard for him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am devastated my goldfish died. I cried for two days straight. <endOfText>
<human> Aww man yeah we get really attached to our pets huh?) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat was just diagnosed with hyperthyroid. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible.  What is the treatment for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They gave us meds but they're not working.  He still seems happy but he's constantly losing weight. <endOfText>
<human> I wish your cat the best.  I know it must be hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on a long road trip soon and I spent yesterday making sure everything was in order before the trip <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool, is it for work or fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm on a diet to try and lose weight but I slipped up. I don't know what to do since my wife and I are dieting together. <endOfText>
<human> How badly did you slip up? You're allowed cheat days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I looked back at some old photos the other day, it was nice to look at some old memories. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I like looking at my old pictures too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hit the lotto last week and became a millionaire. Now I don't need to work the rest of my life. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must be euphoric! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week when I arrived at the office there was a puppy on the receptionist desk! <endOfText>
<human> That's crazy. Where did it come from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im looking forward to my wedding <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting. When is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was prepared last time a hurricane was headed our way? <endOfText>
<human> dont understand you,were you chased by a hurricane? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am constantly finding plates with food or grease still on them. <endOfText>
<human> That is annoying!  Is someone in your house not doing there job cleaning after themselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents paid for all my years in college. It would have cost me a small fortune, so I am forever thankful to them! <endOfText>
<human> How nice of them. My oldest is paying her own way. I wish I was in a situation that I could help her more. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our house burned down and my husband lost his 1969 Camaro. <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness that is horrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had my dog for 15 years and he just died. I don't know what I will do without him. <endOfText>
<human> This happened to us last spring. Our dog was 8 years old. It can be a very emotional time but it gets better over time. Have you thought about creating a memorial for him? Maybe a photo collage to hang. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was not a good experience <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> imagine living in a house alone and in my entire live i have never been alone and now being alone was the thing <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very lonely and sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im always so happy when its about to be new years , they usually binge watch twilight zone all day, my mom makes bomb food, then i buy fire works for the kids , at midnight we all hug each other thankful for another year <endOfText>
<human> We watch the twilight zone too on new years. What is bomb food ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm enjoying a lazy Sunday afternoon. <endOfText>
<human> nice , just relaxing after a long week that sounds perfect honestly <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "i can't wait, my wedding day is close and am going to wed my bride". just too excited <endOfText>
<human> That is great news! I'm sure you are excited! Congratulations to you two! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty happy with how my shed turned out. It was the first time I built something. <endOfText>
<human> You make it out of wood or is it one of those aluminum ones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really close with my sister, but it turns out she is moving out of state in September. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I'm sorry to hear that, is it for work or something else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have faith my car is going to make it 3 hours away to my parent's house <endOfText>
<human> I hope so, is your car in bad shape? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been studying a lot to take the bar test next week. I've also taken several courses to be ready for it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, heard that is a tough test, good luck and I'm sure you are prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister lost her house due to a fire. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. Where's she staying now ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm just enjoying a peaceful Sunday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so relaxing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently read a really good bock. It was so inspirining. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, reading is my favorite past time as well.  What book? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I care about my brother a lot but I think he is started to hang out with the wrong type of crowd. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should talk with him about how you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disgusted to find out my best friend's husband cheated on her. I feel bad for her. <endOfText>
<human> That is so, so sad. Are they going to separate or is there a chance that he can change his ways and earn her trust again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i see vomit i almost want to vomit , and in my job there are no janitors so the males on duty need to clean up the mess , and kids vomit in there at least once a week <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross, you should bail quick if you see a kid getting sick, so that you won't be around to help clean it up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend asked me to help him move one day, but I was working that day. <endOfText>
<human> as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> as a matter of fact my friend asked me help him move recently , but i was busy at work too he understood <endOfText>
<human> Yeah my friend understood, and then changed his whole moving day to a day I had off... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I baked a beautiful cake for my daughter's birthday. I had to make sure it came out good so took a little piece. <endOfText>
<human> How'd it taste? And what kind of cake was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't wait to go the movies tonight with my family, I love family movie night! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really great! What movie are you going to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are going to see Hotel Transylvania, I heard it was a great family movie. <endOfText>
<human> It really is! I hope that you have a good time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a fly in my salad at McDonalds. <endOfText>
<human> No way! that's gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I was little and we would go to the park almost every Sunday.... great memories <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I refinished the concrete slab before erecting a new screened in lanai. <endOfText>
<human> Very good. You must be handy around the house - I'm useless! Lanais are wonderful - and necessary in many places! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby is due in a couple of months. <endOfText>
<human> Is this your first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into a huge fight with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a big math test coming up. I am so worried I will flunk it. <endOfText>
<human> Don't think that well! As long as you are prepared, you will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my first conversation with my two year old the other day. He asked where the cat was and wanted to follow him outside. <endOfText>
<human> That is adorable! I bet you were proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter fell and really hurt her knee. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I hope she's ok!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She is! I had to comfort her. I felt so bad for her <endOfText>
<human> Lol pour water on it next time. Always does the trick! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so mad at my son! He's had the entire summer to do his summer reading and he put it off to the last minute! <endOfText>
<human> I'm not suprised. I always did that as a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> School starts tomorrow and he still isn't done. I guess maybe one day he'll learn not to procrastinate! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah the only way he will learn is if he figures it out by himself.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has the best wife. She is funny beautiful and so caring. <endOfText>
<human> Awww, that's sweet! He was lucky to find such a great partner! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I wish she was mine though. I think I love her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! You can't do that to your friend! You'll find the right single person in time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so jealous of my friend's new girlfriend. She is perfect in every sense of the word <endOfText>
<human> The perfect person for you will come soon enough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new restaurant in town and wow, it was so much better than I even expected <endOfText>
<human> Yum! What type of food was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son stole some money out of his mom's purse. I was so upset I almost forgot to explain how wrong that was. <endOfText>
<human> I would be upset too. You need to sit down and talk to him about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm annoyed with my new neighbors, it seems like they never go to sleep and make so much noise. <endOfText>
<human> Please call the police,its called noise abuse <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ive really desired a doctorate ,but my busy schedle would not allow me <endOfText>
<human> Aw, can't fit any classes into your schedule? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was beaming when my daughter scored the winning goal for her soccer game. She trains so hard and really deserves the praise. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, That's awesome.  The training paid off and I bet she feels really proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm disappointed in my new car, it has already broken down twice and now it's in the shop! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you got a warranty on it. New cars should not have issues for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been so sick the last few days and I'm a single mom. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope that you are getting better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thinking about my high school prom and what a great night it was. I was so cool back then. <endOfText>
<human> Isn't it fun to think of times like that. When you were free of most responsibilites? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah and I had a beautiful date too. <endOfText>
<human> What year did you graduate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So we're a little short on money right now, but luckily we've got parents who want to help us. <endOfText>
<human> That is great that they are willing and able to help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My only child just graduated high school. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow I bet you were really proud? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered food almost two hours ago and it's still not here, ugh! <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst, when they take forever.. Have you called them up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous I didn't the height gene my brother did. I feel so short when I'm around him. <endOfText>
<human> I feel jealous I didn't get the artistic genes my brother got lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a wonderful surprise package the other day from my godmother. I haven't heard from her in years. <endOfText>
<human> That's really awesome! You are a really lucky person! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is so smart and incredible. She just started medical school! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. I am sure she will do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah she is really smart so I know she will do well. <endOfText>
<human> And think one day she may be able to save your life haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ordered food and it came and it's totally the wrong order. Now I have to wait another hour for it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh i can relate, that happened to me with UberEats a couple days ago. Its so frustrating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been neglecting my friends lately. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! At least you noticed now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I ate so much pizza last night. I forgot about my diet...... <endOfText>
<human> How many slices did you ate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning I was organizing some old boxes and I found pictures of me and my friends during our high school years <endOfText>
<human> I've done this before! It can be very nostalgic to see old friends that you haven't seen in awhile. Did it bring back any particular memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever worked so hard, years for one moment that define the rest of your life? <endOfText>
<human> I sort of have. I worked like crazy to get a work visa for the US, so I could be with the person I wanted to spend my life with. It paid off, so I can kind of understand what you're saying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm busy doing a lot of work today. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a good thing or a bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looks like it's going to be another lonely Sunday. All my room mates went back to their home towns. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you could get out and meet some new people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing an Arcade while on vacation brought back flashbacks to my childhood and how much fun I had there! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah arcades are pretty sweet. I like that some of them have bars in them now.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah arcades are pretty sweet. I like that some of them have bars in them now. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I've been to an arcade bar, they are a blast.  Who would of known alcohol makes them more fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting a new job tomorrow and I am so nervous. I home that it goes well. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations and I'm sure you will do fine.  Do you think you will enjoy doing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think so, but I never done a job like this before so I hope do well. <endOfText>
<human> It'll be a good experience at the very least, good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He felt i would amount to nothing ,all with pride1 <endOfText>
<human> Who are you talking about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my wife and my baby are going overseas for a month and i will be so lonely without them. i couldn;t go with them <endOfText>
<human> That could be so hard on you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On Friday I'm having my daughter, I am so nervous! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! Is this your first child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece won a medal in a race at the track and field competition!! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, she must be a quick one, I was always the slow one at the back of the pack. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My back has been having sharp random pains throughout the day, it's annoying! <endOfText>
<human> I imagine, that must be so awful. Have you had that before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is the best. She is so kind and caring and beautiful. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's sweet, I'm glad you love her so much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I would never cheat on her. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, no body should ever cheat in my opinion!  At least end the relationship first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm furious, my wife's brother just wrecked our only car, and I'm pretty sure he had been drinking! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god. That's aweful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying to get rid of house gnats. <endOfText>
<human> Tell me about it, they have to be in my top 5 things I hate the most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing a morning jog the other day and I ended up stepping in dog poop. <endOfText>
<human> Uggh, what a buzzkill. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have built our relationship over the years ,we dont keep secrets <endOfText>
<human> ok and how does that work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i broke up with Tracie last night <endOfText>
<human> Ok ,why would you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt and I clean up/renovate houses, and the one we're working on now was lived by an elderly man with dementia. It has been seriously gross trying to clean! <endOfText>
<human> No way! That's sad for the man but gross for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Spiders are the creepiest things on the planet. I am so scared of those things. <endOfText>
<human> I hate spiders! Especially if you know theres one in the room where you are sleeping! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so grateful for my wife, I honestly don't know where I would be if I didn't have her pushing me in my career. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great that you have such a great partner like her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father in law was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer over 18 years ago now. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, dang, sounds like he is battling it very well though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm anxious to meet my wife's ex-husband. Hopefully it will be civil and not awkward! <endOfText>
<human> I can definitely understand how you would be worried about that.  I think I'd have to decline - LOL!  You are a good person for being willing to meet with him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love star wars. I can't see the next movie that comes out next year! <endOfText>
<human> I've never watched a single full star wars movie, just bits and pieces haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For my birthday I wasn't expecting anything since it landed on a Tuesday, but when I got home my mom had planned a surprise party for me! <endOfText>
<human> You must have been surprised! Were you happy about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was travelling last week and when I arrived home I realized I has left the milk in the milk in the counter! <endOfText>
<human> No way! That must have smelled so bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was extremely emotional when my dog passed away <endOfText>
<human> Aww man sorry for your loss, those are the worst, its like losing your best friend. I hope he passed away peacefully and happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad for eating unhealthy all weekend, I was doing so good with my diet! <endOfText>
<human> It's okay! A cheat weekend every now and then can be well deserved when on a diet! Start right now eating healthy again! You can do it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is due next month with our first kid! I feel prepared in becoming a responsible father! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulation!  It is really smart to be as prepared as possible!  This baby will change your world! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new car and was trying to look cool in it the other day! I miss-judged the curb and totally scratched the rims up in front of people. It was quite embarrassing. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch! That's the worst, are they pretty damaged? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pleased with how much work I've gotten done today. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! It's always so satisfying to look back and see how much you've achieved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is baking us lunch and I can smell it's aaalmost ready. I'm soo hungry it's hard to think anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Yum, what is she cooking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever dealt with someone being really really sick?  A few years back, my husband was diagnosed with meningitis.  He had to be quarantined and we all had to take medication. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. No I've never had to deal with that before. I hope your husband is ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kicked a pigeon that was on sidewalk as I was walking by. <endOfText>
<human> Umm..did you MEAN to kick it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today while walking on the street I passed a dog that seemed to be lost but I didn't stop to help him find his owner. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, poor fellow, well I'm sure he was close to his home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really bummed out today, I had to get rid of my dog because I had to move across the country. <endOfText>
<human> Oh you must be so sad, I know I would be if that had happened to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure if you live in an area with much traffic, but here in Atlanta it's an every day thing.  I was just sitting on the interstate the other day due to a wreck in front of us and I'd been there already for around 30 minutes. <endOfText>
<human> I take the bus so I don't have to deal with the traffic, but man that sounds like it would really stink <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like looking through old pictures. Its so nice to look back on the past. <endOfText>
<human> I used to enjoy doing that with my grandmother, she'd tell me all about when my dad was little.  I love old stories like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah me too. I'm a historian so I love thinking about the past. <endOfText>
<human> What an interesting field - my husband would love to say that was his profession! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh great. There was a big spider in my room, so I went to get something to scoop him up with (or flatten, I hadn't decided between the two yet). I come back and he's disappeared. <endOfText>
<human> oh oh, so now you don't know where your enemy is hiding.  Sounds scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ordered a really nice chair online it should arrive tomorrow, <endOfText>
<human> What kind of chair is it? A lounging chair, or maybe  a computer desk chair? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm impressed with how well our pool is coming a long, it should be ready by next summer! <endOfText>
<human> Sweet!, must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sweet!, must be a really big pool if you have to wait until next summer. <endOfText>
<human> Well it'll be done by the end of fall, we just won't be able to swim then. :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm disappointed with how my garden is turning out, everything is either dying or being eaten by rabbits. <endOfText>
<human> So what would you do to halt that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He promised to give me the said sum of money, on reaching there,i learnt he had travelled <endOfText>
<human> That's not good, do you think he will pay you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day I went to school with a stain on my pants and I didn't realize it. I didn't find it until I came home. <endOfText>
<human> And no one told you about it?  Maybe no one noticed it at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No they noticed. Everyone was laughing at me but I didn't know why. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible!  I hope they realize that their reaction was not exactly nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out yesterday that my dad had a stroke last month! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! I hope is ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have this brother-in-law, my sister-in-law's husband. I feel like he buys video games whenever he wants. <endOfText>
<human> So how does he afford such luxury? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm more than assured of success \ <endOfText>
<human> How so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma is really sick in the hospital. I am optimistic that she will pull through though. <endOfText>
<human> I hope she recovers soon. I know it is hard to see loved ones sick. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it is really hard, but the doctors say she will pull through. <endOfText>
<human> That is good to hear. I am sure she will be fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a good job, a nice house, a lovely dog, and great food. Life is awesome. I am so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! You are a lucky person! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hoping my favorite show would get renewed. I just found out it was cancelled. I'm so upset. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah i've been through that feeling before, I had a show that was going to get cancelled but thankfully it got saved by another company. What show was yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a really good life. I have everything I could want including a house, wife, and a dog. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great. I'm happy for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it's a pretty great life. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, it sounds like you've really made it. I envy you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I had been able to finish that project yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that you couldn't finish it! What couldn't you finish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey you are being too hard on yourself. I'm sure your boss would prefer it done well and not rushed. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, maybe so, but I really could have used that bonus. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never realized it as a kid, but... that scene in Bambi, with the mother, it really is sad! <endOfText>
<human> Yes! I always cried when I watched it as a child. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've never been a big roller coaster fan.  I don't know if  you like them or not, but they scare me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I love the thrill of a good roller coaster. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my childhood dog so much. We had such fun adventures together. Those were the best days. <endOfText>
<human> I could imagine. Dogs are amazing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always been a loyal member of my family. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great, family comes first over everything! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so excited to see the new Star Wars movies but the really are a bit a of a let down <endOfText>
<human> Awe! Really I was planning on seeing it this weekend.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah don't. They really aren't that great. <endOfText>
<human> Really? What was the main disappointment?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awe! Really I was planning on seeing it this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah don't. They really aren't that great.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really? What was the main disappointment? <endOfText>
<human> It's just the fact that it's basically the same kind of stuff that in all of the other movies.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I work in my garden the mosquitoes eat me alive. It is the worst experience! <endOfText>
<human> Omg yes, mosquitos are awful. Do you use any spray? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I locked myself out of my car the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope it din't take that much to get in.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I hope it din't take that much to get in. <endOfText>
<human> I had to call my husband to bring his keys, but it was a bit embarrassing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought the new Star Wars movies were so great. The are cinematic perfection. <endOfText>
<human> I've been enjoying them too, but not quite as much as the originals. It's not my generation anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just think George Lucas has really outdone himself this time. <endOfText>
<human> But, he's got little to do with it at this point. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Late last year I invested in cryptocurrency when everyone was hyping it up and I was expecting great returns this year. Well, I've gotten great LOSSES. Pretty bummed out. <endOfText>
<human> I don't know much about cryptocurrency at all.  You were brave to invest in a new thing, but I'm sorry that you lost money. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always thought that I liked my alone time.  However now I'm not so sure. <endOfText>
<human> Are you feeling more lonely than you expected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's always so quiet at night, on those nights when you can't sleep. <endOfText>
<human> It's called the hour of the wolf.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's called the hour of the wolf. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, seriously? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm nervous about an upcoming trip. <endOfText>
<human> Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so dumb. I walked around all day with my fly unzipped. I bet so many people noticed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh don't stress it, i've done that so many times. It happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are leaving for Hawaii in the morning! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds exciting. I've always wanted to go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like going to country craft shows. Makes me feel old fashioned. <endOfText>
<human> There's some decent benefits to doing things the old way.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's some decent benefits to doing things the old way. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I tend to think so too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's tough being picky. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I'm a picky eater. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car didn't have really functional air conditioning forever, and it was suffering. We finally had it fixed and now when I sit in it, it feels soooooo good, I'm so glad we had it done. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, i cant imagine not having AC in this hot florida weather! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so shocked when my great grandpa visited the other day. He never leaves his house. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like such a surprise. Does he have a disability that keeps him at home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are headed for a big vacation in Florida next summer for our daughter's graduation trip. <endOfText>
<human> Oh awesome, what part of Florida? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really though a was going to get hired for a  job after I had this great interview, but they called to tell me they had hired someone else. <endOfText>
<human> wow ,try next time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Poor service delivery by an airline staff really pissed me <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 15 my dog died. I'd had her since I was 4 years old. Practically my whole life at that point. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. I know how it feels to lose a pet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The world would be a cleaner place if not for children. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have decided to move my son to a new daycare that is closer to home. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds rather convenient. Are you giving up anything for that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through old pictures the other day of when my daughter was little, it was pretty neat reliving some of those days. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, i dont have kids yet but i was also looking through some old school photos of me and my friends. Such innocent times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Television is so different these days. <endOfText>
<human> I agree and it's full of commercials no one wants to see. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes, I know what you are saying. I've never been into GOT but I've heard it's good. <endOfText>
<human> If you've never seen it, do yourself a favor and watch the first two episodes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone hit my car in the parking lot and didn't even leave a note. I was so livid there is a big scrape on my door. <endOfText>
<human> I would be so mad. I can't believe people can do that and sleep at night <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am moving hundreds of miles away from my friends and family to start a new life with my husband. <endOfText>
<human> wow! love birds,how nice,so where exactly are you headed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a pizza but the waitress served me a burger <endOfText>
<human> How annoying! Did she fix it fast? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad had a stroke about a month ago and we've been waiting to see if he would recover 100%. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry thats awful, i hope he makes a full recovery <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just applied for a higher paying position within my company. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, what is the position? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Doesn't it always seem like there's a new reboot of something sprouting up wherever you look? <endOfText>
<human> Give me an example? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned a picnic with a friend and it rained. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's too bad. Perhaps have the picnic indoors? It wouldn't be the same, but at least you could share food and have a laugh! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were told that he had colorectal cancer! <endOfText>
<human> Who has cancer? Someone you know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hears some very strange noises coming from under my bed last night. I am too scared to look. Could be the bogeyman. <endOfText>
<human> LoL....no sweetie, I'm sure it's your dog again. Didn't the same thing happen last month? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girls had to take biology last year - they dissected a frog. <endOfText>
<human> I remember that. A lot of people were grossed out and didn't want to do it. Were your girls one of them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my best friend one of my deepest darkest secrets <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope they are trustworthy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat has been battling cancer for a couple months and has had 2 surgeries. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that, my girlfriend's cat is going through the same thing right now. It can't be easy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What does it take to not ever have someone in one's life <endOfText>
<human> Usually people want someone in their life. I guess that takes staying away from others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so shocked when I saw my dog walk by wearing my underwear! Turns out he was playing in the laundry basket and got tangled in my drawers. <endOfText>
<human> I would laugh so hard if that was me seeing my dog do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sometimes worry about the future and what would happen to the world with global warming and all this political turmoil. <endOfText>
<human> i do too, its a shame <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really glad it's Sunday. Sundays are the one day I have off, and they're just lazy and slow and I'm lazy (and slow, ha) so it's my favorite time of the week. <endOfText>
<human> Lucky for you! I'm at work right now! Haha! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We drove by our old house today. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow did it bring back memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looks like I have 2 million things to be thankful for <endOfText>
<human> Well it is good to be thankful. We have to remember all the little things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe it when my kid started taking his first steps the other day. It was unexpected because he had not even come close before. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you got it on camera, I would if i was in your shoeas <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little boy has come far with his speech and I am so proud of him. <endOfText>
<human> Awww good for him!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww good for him! <endOfText>
<human> He's been getting speech therapy since he was 1. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was driving somewhere unfamiliar and I got lost. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens. I'm so bad with directions. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother finally went to college! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great news. I bet he is having lots of fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just got back from a buffet and ate 16 oysters , plus 4 different mixed plates , i feel a sense of accomplishment <endOfText>
<human> That's a ton of oysters! I don't think I've even ever eaten one oyster. What's a mixed plate?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's a ton of oysters! I don't think I've even ever eaten one oyster. What's a mixed plate? <endOfText>
<human> the oysters are a little slimy but still good with lime and tabasco , and one the mixed plates i put in like crabs, craw fish rice noodles just a bunch of mixed foods <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've worked as a programmer for the last 7 years and this year's review was finally all positive! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome to hear , i bet the pays good too  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is awesome to hear , i bet the pays good too <endOfText>
<human> Hmm ya I make more than my parents which is all I ever really asked out of life though sadly less than I would make in a bigger town. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> if your happy there i would stay if not seek the better pay in a different town <endOfText>
<human> I agree one hundred percent! At the end of the day, being around my friends and family means a whole lot more than an extra 10k.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so dumb when I realized the shirt I was wearing was inside-out. I bet so many people noticed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that had to be embarrassing.  I know how you feel though b/c I once went to work with two different shoes on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfather passed away over a year ago, and I was looking at some of the older photos I have of him and I as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry. I know that must be very difficult for you. It's nice that you have pictures to look at and remember old times together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt guilty yesterday because I yelled at my kids.. <endOfText>
<human> We all do it. I bet they deserved it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset when my dog chewed up the model airplane I was building. He thought it was a toy. Now I got to get a new one. <endOfText>
<human> Dogs can be so destructive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy asked if we could go camping soon, and I haven't been able to go for quite a while. <endOfText>
<human> Ok ,so are you gonna go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i failed ajob test 3 times due to inadequate information <endOfText>
<human> Dang three times?  I hope you get that figured out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw my dog give birth to puppies. I had no idea she was even pregnant! <endOfText>
<human> How shocking! I have got to know, are you keeping the puppies or giving them up for adoption? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a bus trip to Philadelphia today. The bus was totally gross. There was sticky stuff on the floors and there was a horrible smell too. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasn't a long ride on the bus.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that sounds horrible. I hope it wasn't a long ride on the bus. <endOfText>
<human> It was about 4 hours lots of time to enjoy it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is amazing how some of the patients I see at work can have such horrible teeth!! <endOfText>
<human> i bet so. its a shame when people dont take care of their teeth <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am horrible at cooking, but I recently tried out a new recipe. <endOfText>
<human> I have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps. Cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention, even more so when I'm hungry af!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have found that using alot of online recipes with good instructions helps. Cannabis also induces hunger and reduced adhd thus it helps me pay better attention, even more so when I'm hungry af! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I was shocked to find my recipe came out pretty good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man sometimes I find myself at work just being frustrated over the fact that I know there is work available but I can't grasp it because pople aren't playing fair. you ever had that issues? <endOfText>
<human> Not that I can think of. Can you give me an example? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math exam tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Did you at least study for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Part of my job is to clean up the bathrooms at the end of the night. Usually it's not so bad, but last night someone stuck so much toilet paper inside of the toilet that it overflowed EVERYWHERE. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that really sucks. Did you ever find the culprit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug last night. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when they do that! Were you able to clean the rug? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy just rented a moving truck over 30 feet long. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is huge. He must have a lot of stuff to haul. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I hear tapping on my window at night I think it is a ghost. I have such a wild imagination. <endOfText>
<human> Has it ever been a ghost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today. <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome! What did he say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the blowing all by myself yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not quite sure I understand, did you go bowling by yourself? If so that's so sad and lonesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole candy from the candy store yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> did you feel like being spontaneous or just did it for the thrill of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died 5 minutes ago. I am so distraught. <endOfText>
<human> That is a real bummer. Maybe you should take some time to reflect on their life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really worried I will flunk my Geometry test. I just don't get the material. <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. Have you gone to get some help on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That sounds like a messy situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend got the prettiest girl in the class. I wish I had his game. I am better looking but he gets the girl every time. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure once you clean up your scruffy look you'll be able to land all the ladies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> He must be related to my dog. Was it hard to clean up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my mom she has accomplished so much. Did you know she got a GED and didn't finish high school? <endOfText>
<human> That is so awesome! Good for her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend bought me an outfit by himself and I actually loved it. <endOfText>
<human> Really, I can't believe you like it. Are you sure he bought it and not his mom lol? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is your dog trained to go outside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when ever i am with a friend and they are looking at messages and texting while driving, it drives me nuts like what if they hit someone or we have an accident <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I am the same way. Incredibly unsafe to do such a thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> good then i am not the only one that finds that extremely annoying <endOfText>
<human> I know. I don't want to die doing something incredibly mundane. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole some candy from the store yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> i hope you feel bad about what you did  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope you feel bad about what you did <endOfText>
<human> I feel somewhat bad. But at least my sweet tooth is satisfied. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kicked my feet up and read a book at the park today. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very relaxing. What kind of book was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when I saw a $50 bill laying on the sidewalk. I grabbed it and headed to the corner store. <endOfText>
<human> Dang. What did you by? Mountain dew and doritos? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, was it a nice rug? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece just learned how to ride a bike! <endOfText>
<human> Aw how wonderful. She must have been really proud of herself and happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> With the way the world is going right now, I've been trying to go off grid. I'm investing in solar power and starting up my own small farm. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like an interesting life choice. It's probably very calming. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm worried I will fail my Chemistry test next week. I can't remember all the elements in the periodic table. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been studying? If you do that, I am sure you won't fail. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> You are the 2nd one today. Was it a mile high? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister flew over to my state during the weekend and I wasn't expecting it at al! <endOfText>
<human> oh thats a nice surprise <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone cut me off in traffic today <endOfText>
<human> Shocking. Does that not happen often for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I farted at work today in front of everyone. <endOfText>
<human> Lol owning it is just about the only thing you can do at that point! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just over at some friends multi million dollar house for their sons birthday party... <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Did you steal anything while you were there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, thats amazing.  What did he say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got upset on my drive home today <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Did someone cut you off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going off to college soon and I'll be leaving the small town that I grew up in. It's a pretty tough thing to do, I really love this place and have a strong attachment to it. <endOfText>
<human> Understandably so. You must be pretty anxious over the whole ordeal. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about starting my new job tomorrow. I am nervous I won't make good first impressions. <endOfText>
<human> thats fair tho i wouldnt worry about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend helped me move last summer <endOfText>
<human> That is a very nice friend. Moving is hard work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens.  I bet that smelled great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went ice skating for the first time the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Did you fall? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog popped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> eww i know how that feels <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my carpet today <endOfText>
<human> Oh geez! I bet that was a CATastrophe! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really good about myself today , i avoided fast food restaurants all week and probably saved a ton of cash <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's a good point! I never realized how much money I was spending for fast food until I started making a budget. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost crashed into me today <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Are you hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today. <endOfText>
<human> thats so amazing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> That is unfortunate. I hope it wasn't 1 or 2 miles high? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss the days my parents took me to the fair. I loved to go on the rides and eat candied apples. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Did you ever find any worms in the apples? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a guy convince someone to give them there phone <endOfText>
<human> Mustve been some good convincing.  Was it a robbery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't understand why people dress up like clowns.  I think they are pretty freaky.  Like what would make you want to do that? <endOfText>
<human> im not sure i think its just an old tradition <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my wallet today. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you lose it at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker just bought a brand new car! <endOfText>
<human> They are so lucky. I would love to have a new car. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my carpet today <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's horrible. Were you able to clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my final exam for my class on Friday. I'd been too busy partying to be able to study at all. Despite having no idea what was going on I wound up with an A! <endOfText>
<human> thats great, good job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So usually I like taking out the trash because it makes you seem useful but it's really easy. Today though I almost threw up, the dumpster was absolutely vile and I have no idea why. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean.  Its an easy chore, but sometimes that smell is gross.  Its that sweet smell. yuck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole some candy from the store today. <endOfText>
<human> oh really? why was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone almost crashed into me today <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've worked for the same company for 10 years and worked my way up to a good position. I was recently informed that the company will be shutting down everyone is being laid off. I have no idea how I'm going to afford my mortgage and my other things. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. Maybe you should get another job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog didn't poop on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's great! I'm guessing he has a bad habit of doing that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's so aggravating, my dog still has accidents but not many <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A first cousin of mine who was on his way to obtaining his PHD was suddenly killed in a car accident caused by someone who was driving recklessly. It hurts my heart so deeply. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that, my child hood friend died in a car crash , and it hurt me for a really long time, i still have dreams about him through out the years <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have been taking cbd oil for sometime and it works wonders , recently they started selling locally but im not sure i want to try it just yet <endOfText>
<human> I've actually heard a little bit about CBD oil from my sister, but I never did any research myself or try it out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it takes away my chronic pain, one time i just said the hell with it ill skip one day, most painful day of my life worst choice ever <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, so it actually works? I might have to give it a try and let me mother know about it, she has a lot of pain in her legs as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> look up on youtube, and put charlottes web  .there is a beautiful story about the girl charlotte <endOfText>
<human> I absolutely will! Thanks for the suggestion. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to a concert tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like so much fun.  What concert is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to the doctors next week, and I am not looking forward to it at all <endOfText>
<human> I wouldn't look forward to that either. What are you going in for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom let me move back in her when my relationship didn't work out. <endOfText>
<human> That's super nice of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so thankful to have such a good mother. She is the best! <endOfText>
<human> Good parents are super useful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole candy from the store today. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you steal candy from the store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My garage was broken into and the thief stole my lawnmower, tools, and other items.  It was not a fun thing to come home to. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that really stinks. Did you catch the culprit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No.  I am a bit upset that my home security system did not go off. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, especially since I imagine that is a costly monthly expense. I would install some turrets in your garage. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the carpet today. <endOfText>
<human> That's always fun to clean up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandson is about to go off to college in the big city next week! He's very excitied! I'm a bit nervous about how he'll do overall. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. What city? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the most upset that I've ever been before was when my rabbit died a while back. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that. How long did you have your rabbit for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! We're you able to clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished my a/c condensor, and it was really dirty! <endOfText>
<human> Ew! Sounds like a disgusting job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when people are inconsiderate and don't care about others <endOfText>
<human> I do too, but seems like most people are like that nowadays <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't feel good about myself right now. I took something from a boyfriend's house without him knowing. <endOfText>
<human> Oops. Could you sneak it back in without him seeing you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my rug today <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, hope it didn't dry into the carpet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really waiting for my physics grade to come out and I was happy when I saw I did well in the class somehow. <endOfText>
<human> thats great, good job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother made it to the local news paper last year, it shocked us all he was given a full scholar ship to a totally different state <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where is he going to school at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> dangit , i would have been pretty upset , not to mention the clean up  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> dangit , i would have been pretty upset , not to mention the clean up <endOfText>
<human> Totally. I was so annoyed since it was a 10 million dollar carpet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so lonesome! My husband just left for a boys' trip. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad! Maybe you should give him a call? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!! You must have been so mad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good.  Did you scold your cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car broke down this week and the mechanic said that there is nothing they can really do for it.  It is just done.  I am going to miss that car. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. What kind of car was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sure Trump is doing what is best to our country. <endOfText>
<human> I think the opposite, honestly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted to get an A in physics but I didn't. <endOfText>
<human> What happened?? You did not studied hard enough? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my wallet today. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of your neighbor! I hope everything was still inside of it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a week of shopping, I'm ready for my son to go back to school tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What grade is your son in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tell you. When I make spaghetti, it is AMAZING. <endOfText>
<human> Ha! At least you're confident in your skills. Do you do anything special to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died 10 minutes ago. I am quite saddened. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, I am so sorry. Was it of natural causes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a huge fear of heights, so when I went on a plane for the first time, I was the most scared I had ever been <endOfText>
<human> Thats pretty brave of you facing a fear like that.  How did you feel when the flight was over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished moving my friend into his really nice, new house. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulation! thats awesome. I know how much work that can be <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents reminded me of this time from when I was younger and got sent to the principals office <endOfText>
<human> Lol are they still holdig that against you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park all by myself yesterday. It was quite lonesome. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to find someone to go with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset, my dog passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Mine did too - 5 minutes ago, actually. Are you thinking about getting a new one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked Tiger Woods is playing gold again. <endOfText>
<human> Hell yeah! Return of the king! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I went to a baby shower for my friend the other day, only to realize I bought a present for a baby boy and not a baby girl! <endOfText>
<human> That must of looked really bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad came to my birthday party. I wasn't expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice he showed up. He doesn't normally ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my wallet today. I was so relieved! <endOfText>
<human> That is lucky!  I left mine in a restaurant last week and luckily someone turned it in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat pooped on the carpet today. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks, did you clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at Mcdonalds. I was sick after. <endOfText>
<human> Same here. Maybe we ate at the same one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super into exercising. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! What is your favorite exercise to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the carpet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I hope you were able to clean it up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like taking my grandma out to lunch and dinner sometimes <endOfText>
<human> Aww that is very nice of you! Are you two very friendly with one another? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy with my house. <endOfText>
<human> That's good! Any particular reasons why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really try my best to help my mother. <endOfText>
<human> What are you helping her with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend helped me move last week <endOfText>
<human> Cool, how long did that take? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried really hard to get a 34 on the ACT for a scholarship but instead I got a 33. <endOfText>
<human> that really sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was going to help me do something but they ditched last week <endOfText>
<human> Well that's lousy of them! What did you want them to help you with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow I'm going to an amusement park with my sister and some friends. I'm kinda excited because I haven't been to one since I was pretty young. <endOfText>
<human> that sounds quite fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a really scary haunted house recently! I have never been more scared! <endOfText>
<human> Niiice. What kind of things did it have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My top recommendation, is that if you have multiple kids, find a babysitter when you grocery shop. <endOfText>
<human> I'm just about to have my second child! Shopping with one is tough, getting a sitter sounds like a great idea! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He's a good worker but not as reliable as I am. He is always calling in or not putting much effort into his work. I feel I should have gotten that position. <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame, if that's the case then I agree. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate having to wake up early to go to classes. <endOfText>
<human> Do you get enough sleep at night? Try getting to bed earlier at night <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally made a mistake with my bank account a while ago. I managed to try to withdraw too much and I got hit with a $25 overdraft fee. It was really frustrating and annoying. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer. Did you at least go get it resolved at the bank? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to a rural area recently. At night I've been hearing all kinds of weird animal noises and I see large foot prints near my home in the morning. It's scary as all heck out here at night! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah I could imagine. I've always lived in big cities. I couldn't imagine having to deal with true darkness and wild animals! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a baseball game with my favorite team a few weeks ago. They had been doing pretty badly in the first half. Somehow they managed to pull it together and win in the end! That made me very happy! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Sometimes pulling through a tough battle is more satisfying than just winning outright! Shows perseverance and a "never give up" attitude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting married in two months. I'm so excited, but admittedly a little nervous too. I think about it all the time. <endOfText>
<human> I am so happy for you! I have been married for ten years and it is the most rewarding thing ever. But you should be nervous because in two months you have to share everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My older sister is always comparing our children. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's kind of rude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog got out and I haven't found her yet <endOfText>
<human> where did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my girlfriend cheated on me <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out a few days ago that my new employer is fantastic, as far as working with my schedule. I will have all the time I need to balance work, school, and family time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is awesome! Even barely awesome employers are hard to find. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes the anticipation on waiting for shipped orders to arrive are horrible! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, especially when it is something you are really looking forward to receiving. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Right or something you really need but can't easily pick up locally. <endOfText>
<human> Yep, but at least we have the internet to take care of those things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my favorite jacket and I can't find it <endOfText>
<human> did you try redoing your steps of the last day? to see maybe you left it at a friends house <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the Dallas Cowboys! <endOfText>
<human> What do you love about football season? (They're football right?) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having a hard time with someone who keeps repeating the same mistakes. <endOfText>
<human> What are they repeating? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used Youtube to fix my fridge. <endOfText>
<human> It's awesome. Sometimes I also try to find solutions in youtube. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone spread rumor about my hubby. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Did you guys clear that out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, but I didn't believe them. he loves me more than anyone in this world. <endOfText>
<human> People must have no lives to want to spread rumors like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday while swimming at my moms pool in the backyard, my toddler took her bottle of tanning oil and unscrewed the cap and poured it all over the lanai. I was so mad, that stuff is not cheap and can stain things easily. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my. How did you handle the situation with your toddler? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The backyard makes me miss my dog. <endOfText>
<human> where did he go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw someone had put a dent in my car door <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I lost over 10k in an investment. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, high risk investment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my friends are getting married and I don't even have a partner <endOfText>
<human> A lot of marriages also end in divorce, when they go into it too soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend of 4 years ended last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> why did your friendship with your friend ended? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been exercising consistently for 3 months now. Been feeling so much better <endOfText>
<human> For what purpose you do this <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone this weekend <endOfText>

<human> im sure it wont take you long with that degree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling a bit of trepidation about today actually. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that, is there something scheduled today that you really are trying to avoid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an award for being employee of the month. <endOfText>
<human> Great job!  Did anything else come with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not get my lawn mower to work. <endOfText>
<human> did you take it in to get fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! What made you feel all alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really upset during that time.But i was confident. I worked hard in next project and got promotion <endOfText>
<human> What time was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My second vacuum I ordered from a company works good but the metal pole is not working right. <endOfText>
<human> Complaint them about the product <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> first time making a cake. it turned out pretty well. <endOfText>
<human> You must be proud. What kind of cake did you make. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was leaning back in my chair at work and fell over. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Girl I asked out said "no" <endOfText>
<human> Did you propose her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in extreme fear yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend got to go golfing this weekend. I was a little envious <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool! Does he have a country club membership? What were you doing that you couldn't go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Grandma made me a big pot of her homemade potato salad yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet that was so good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a new sweet dog who was abused and her little puppy. <endOfText>
<human> So you have two dogs? That is so nice I love dogs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone threw a bunch of empty beer cans in the bed of my truck. <endOfText>
<human> they must have something against trucks <endOfText>

<human> OH! I do too! They are so healthy and you can get them without any sugar too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Felt a bit alone this weekend <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, sounds like family took a trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the beach for the first time since I was pretty young, and the smell of the seawater triggered a lot of memories. I didn't find this out until I got back home that memories are sometimes really closely tied to scents. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes they are! I love it when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tired of people going 50-60 down my side street. <endOfText>
<human> How fast are they supposed to be going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got woken up today by the sound of my phone going off. I haaate the sound of phones, they really stress me out for some reason. <endOfText>
<human> did you mute it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate seeing homeless people <endOfText>
<human> We don't see many here. Do you live in a city? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so disgusted at my neighbor who flooded my apartment from above. I will make him to pay for the whole renovation <endOfText>
<human> What happened to make him flood things? Something overflowed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dealing with a partner away at therapy is tough. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Is she undergoing it for depression or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  Someone in a parking lot do  that to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a thank you note from a co-worker.". <endOfText>
<human> thats cool! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my neighbor has a dog that wont shutup <endOfText>
<human> That has to be really annoying.  Have you called animal control? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared to walk home alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Was there something going on around you that made you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was impressed when i saw lebron leave the cavs a second time <endOfText>
<human> What was impressive about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I slept in this morning. I was more than okay with it <endOfText>
<human> that sounds cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend, my friends and I are heading out to the casino. I'm gonna try to bring home more money than I left with this time! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like so much fun. I've actually never been to a casino but would love to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get my daughter the gift she wanted <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure she'll be happy with whatever gift you got her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend won the lottery, wasn't expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow.  How much did they win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was waiting to hear back on a loan so I can buy a car. Everything should be ok but I am getting nervous waiting on it. <endOfText>
<human> you try calling for a status update? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> Pets are great companions! What kind of pet is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sure has been a low slow Monday. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What's going on? Or, y'know, not going on ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wound up on the floor at Panera Bread not too long ago. <endOfText>
<human> Slippery floor, or slippery you ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter made us late on the first day of school <endOfText>
<human> what did she do? woke up late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was horrible seeing a dog get hit by a car the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That is gorrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole my trash can. <endOfText>
<human> Why on earth would someone do that? A totally pointless act! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The city will literally give you one for free.  I don't even get it. <endOfText>
<human> Some people will steal anything, I guess. A store employee once told me they had to keep certain things by the checkout or they walked! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone playing an entire song by themselves at a talent show once. <endOfText>
<human> How'd they do? <endOfText>

<human> Oh wow like for law school? or what you take after law school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a random box of diapers the other day, the size and brand that my son wears. It was just delivered to my house and had no return address or anything. I don't know who sent them but it was very nice of them! <endOfText>
<human> Oh Wow! That is awesome! I wonder who did it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> Did you find out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope I will get a raise after my training <endOfText>
<human> i hope so too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just got back home from shopping! It was so much fun. <endOfText>
<human> what did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Clothes, shoes, and babygirl got some toys! It was so much fun. <endOfText>
<human> that does sound like fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a project i was working on and my boss had some questions... if i told him the truth i could possibly get fired so i lied. <endOfText>
<human> Oh lord! Why did you need to lie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bit upset I was up all night again, not my dogs fault so much as she is just a new momma. <endOfText>
<human> aweee you got puppies? i barely sleep so i feel you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was disappointed when i couldnt go home <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Why couldn't you go home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A girl asked me out <endOfText>
<human> what did you say <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite steak and cheese place is closing down <endOfText>
<human> That sounds crappy! When do they close?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds crappy! When do they close? <endOfText>
<human> Probably within next month. I look forward to grabbing a sub from there everyday after work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a huge storm the other day and it was extremely loud, very dark. <endOfText>
<human> Storms can be quite scary! Is it over now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thankfully yes and you are right it was quite scary at the moment! <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully, that's the last storm for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm graduating in the Winter and already have a job lined up <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! I hope it's a good paying job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What kind of pet was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my dog every time I see a dog <endOfText>
<human> did he pass away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw a dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, how big is the dent? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 2 year old was such a good girl today out and I am very proud of her! <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are a happy parent then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I am because I was dreading even going out with her as she usually gets fussy real quick. <endOfText>
<human> I guess thats all kids though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty happy this weekend. I got to go kayaking with friends <endOfText>
<human> Sounds really fun do you go kayaking often?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds really fun do you go kayaking often? <endOfText>
<human> No it was my first time going actually <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After 8 years of dating, we're getting married. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome news! congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared to walk home alone last week <endOfText>
<human> Why did you have to walk home alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a presentation soon. I always get nervous talking in front of people <endOfText>
<human> I do too! Do you feel like you are prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so blessed these days to just be alive in general. <endOfText>
<human> thats good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think a lot of people take it for granted and dont realize its a blessing to even be able to wake up. <endOfText>
<human> i think you are right about that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for next week! <endOfText>
<human> Whats happening next week?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whats happening next week? <endOfText>
<human> kids go back to school <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought a audi R8 last week. I am happy for him but however i kind of feel something inside <endOfText>
<human> Audis are pretty nice. You must feel a bit jealous, hu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a date and apparently had a booger hanging out the whole time. <endOfText>
<human> ah damn!! it would have been pretty embarrassing!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went out shopping the other day get home all excited to use my new shampoo and............. cant find it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, what do you think happened to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The cashier forgot to spin the thing around, and I never grabbed it off from that bagging cart. ugh <endOfText>
<human> I've had that happen. Are you going back to get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No one's at the office. Never been alone here before. <endOfText>
<human> How long have you been working there for?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How long have you been working there for? <endOfText>
<human> ABout 6 years now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty good going to the gym this morning. I had a plan of what I wanted to workout and it worked <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Do you workout regularly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I helped my neighbor mow her lawn. I barely have the energy to mow my own. <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of you though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get the gift my daughter wanted <endOfText>
<human> Yea that can be hard sometimes. Im sure will understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy. I made an A in all three of my summer classes. I have never done that before. <endOfText>
<human> hard work pays of <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, I'm one of the only men around so I tend to take out the heavier trash. Tdoay, the trash bag busted all over me. It was so gross, and I was choking on that sickly sweet trash smell. <endOfText>
<human> Gross! Do you work in a restaurant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so proud of my oldest son. He finished 6th grade on the A honor roll. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That's getting to the point where you look at their homework and realize you forgot how difficult it was, ha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a letter in the mail today from a friend. It was a nice shock for me <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. How long has it been since you last spoke with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i see beggars on the road side. I feel pity on them and i just want to do something for them <endOfText>
<human> do you give them money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was angry when i saw someone had put a dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> oh damn!! did you find who it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw someone put a dent in my car door <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you actually see them do it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! Did you actually see them do it? <endOfText>
<human> no i didnt see anyone when i got back to my car <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week i had my bachelor party. It happened in a location i least expected it <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was fun. Like where? A museum or something Lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat got spooked by something and jumped over my half wall that I had a candle sitting on top of, and knocked the burning candle onto the ground shattering the glass everywhere and liquid wax flew all over. I dont even know how Im going to clean this up! <endOfText>
<human> that's a mess and i feel pity for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied to a few jobs, and I was interviewed for the one I was most interested in. I haven't heard back from them though, so I don't think I got the jobl <endOfText>
<human> Stay positive, you never know. Maybe send them a polite email saying thank you for the interview and things you liked about the company. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was a little sad when i couldnt get off from work last week <endOfText>
<human> What were young to do with your freetime? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My tattoo artist really made my tattoo pop. I trust him now more than ever <endOfText>
<human> what did he do to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephews came over a few days ago and it reminded me of my good childhood days. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I'm sure you are a great uncle! It's fun to be youthful sometimes and relive childhood memories! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids start school next week. <endOfText>
<human> mine started today!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get off of work on time <endOfText>
<human> That's always disappointing. In time for what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful to have a roof over my head, and food to eat. Its been rough lately but life is good. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like life is finally moving the right direction for you, it's great to be thankful for the simple things in life! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is it truly is! Its a beautiful feeling! :) <endOfText>
<human> Yes :) people get so caught up in material things and forgot how blessed they are to have food and shelter! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the road earlier today and saw someone throw a bunch of rubbish out of their window. <endOfText>
<human> did you call the po-po ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting a raise and a promotion in Feb. <endOfText>
<human> wow that sounds nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was excited when i got approved for my vacation <endOfText>
<human> Great, where will you be going ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i saw someone had taken my lunch from the fridge at work <endOfText>
<human> Did you find out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when the gym is so very full.. <endOfText>
<human> are you able to go real early before the crowds get there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my job. I have been with the same company for several years. <endOfText>
<human> It's awesome. Hope you're getting promotions at right time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't receive a cashback offer on purchasing the item. <endOfText>
<human> Were you supposed to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my brother was suspended from high school awhile back, it made me sick <endOfText>
<human> Why was he suspended, did he do something wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to be prepared for a bit trip beforehand. <endOfText>
<human> what do you do to get prepared <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost hit a dog running down the road last night. It was pretty scary <endOfText>
<human> What kind of dog was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so late for work and trying to drive fast to get there. <endOfText>
<human> Why were you late <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> yea i also love my sister pet <endOfText>

<human> That's good :)  Having a good family always makes life easier. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe he marked me wrong on that test. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! How long did you study for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just put on a halloween mask and jumped in the window! I jumped out of my seat. <endOfText>
<human> That must've been scary, what kind of mask! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when i got approved for a vacation <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear! How long is the vacation for? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Didn't mean to break his glass but I totally did. <endOfText>
<human> What kinda glass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm afraid to check my messages. The last line I saw from my friend is "we broke up" <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, you got to check though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt all alone the other day <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, did you do anything to not feel so lonely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out the other day that my sister is pregnant. <endOfText>
<human> is that a good thing or bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest daughter has a cold. <endOfText>
<human> have you gone to the doctor yet? or is it not that serious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt get approved for a day off last week <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that! Is it that busy at work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's wife got into an accident. She can't walk anymore, and he's still with her 20 years later since then. <endOfText>
<human> thats great of him to stick by her side. you dont see that anymore <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm working hard to pay off all my debts. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get in debt for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got accepted to my dream school, Yale! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That's amazing. Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother graduated a few years ago, and now he's ready to buy a home <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Life moves fast, doesn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss tasked my coworkers and I each with an individual project and whoever did the best would get a promotion. My coworker blew us all out of the water with her project. I only wish I had her skill... <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I'd just use that as motivated to get better. I'm sure you can get to her level or exceed it with some deligence. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm changing careers. Going to cooking school. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow.. gonna be the next bobby flay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw someone had dented my door <endOfText>
<human> Parking lot accidents are so rampant. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weekend went by so fast. <endOfText>
<human> It sure did. Did you get a chance to relax and have some fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought me a $400 knife <endOfText>
<human> Nice friend. All of mine have been gone for decades. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so ready waiting for my package to arrive today. <endOfText>
<human> I love package delivery days!  I've got a couple coming as well.  What are you waiting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting on a fitness machine to come. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, a big package!  Hope you enjoy it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend will be working abroad for 4 years. She's the only female in her team. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch... I'd have to admit that it would make me a tad nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been putting in a lot of work teaching my dog how to run an obstacle course. Yesterday he did amazing; he broke his old speed and wasn't distracted a single time while doing the course! <endOfText>
<human> hahaha you must be so proud! How long did it take you to teach him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my lunch and my wallet at home this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, heartbreaking. If I were your co-worker and you told me that, I'd lend you at least a couple bucks for the vending machines or something. Hopefully you can go home and have a nice dinner. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my health insurance coverage lapse and don't have any insurance right now. Figured I'd be okay since I'm young and haven't gotten sick or hurt in years. Just yesterday, someone smacked into me and my leg hurts a ton now. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch that sucks.   Honestly, if you had a crappy obamacare bronze plan its unlikely they'd pay for anything anyways.  Its always a nightmare.    You've got to spend a fair amont of cash before they cover anything but a checkup. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im feeling pretty bad right now. I cheated on my math final. <endOfText>
<human> thats a bad feeling :/ dont be too hard on yourself  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats a bad feeling :/ dont be too hard on yourself <endOfText>
<human> It wasnt anything too major. I wrote a few formulas down so I would not forget them. Still kind of crummy though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for my first day at my new job. I went out and bought all new outfits. <endOfText>
<human> That is always a good feeling.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is! Great to be ready to roll. <endOfText>
<human> Thats the spirit. It is always exciting to start something new. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is always a good feeling. <endOfText>
<human> It is! Great to be ready to roll.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It feels great having a girlfriend who puts her trust in you that you wouldn't do anything to hurt her. My current girlfriend, unlike my ex, has no problems with me going out with my friends occasionally. <endOfText>
<human> That must be so nice having that freedom. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just sent out some applications for my dream schools. <endOfText>
<human> Oooh, that's exciting!  What schools did you apply for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to get next week off form work <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah what do you plan on doing?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i wanna go to vegas to go gamble a little <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a good time!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah what do you plan on doing? <endOfText>
<human> i wanna go to vegas to go gamble a little  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled coffee all over my new shorts the other day. <endOfText>
<human> did you have some back up clothes ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No and I had just got the shorts. :( <endOfText>
<human> oh that stinks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This parrot can hold full conversations. Only problem is it keeps calling its owner fat while he's eating <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, that made me laugh. Never really seen a parrot speak that well before. Thought it as just something you see in movies. Does it say anything else fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom, who's in her 60s, lost her best friend today, who passed away. She was one of the only friends my mother had, and I feel sad for her since she lost a connection to her childhood and past. She seems really lonely. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. It's hard losing someone that dear to her. I hope she opens herself up to healing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just had to dissect a frog. <endOfText>
<human> I did that 32 years ago in high school. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been married forever. I'm good with it. <endOfText>
<human> What is your wifes name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my lucky pen. <endOfText>
<human> thats a bummer! How long ago did you lose it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats a bummer! How long ago did you lose it? <endOfText>
<human> I lost it yesterday. But having it for 3 years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a bonus the other day at work and felt so blessed. <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear! Congrats!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks it really made me feel great. <endOfText>
<human> Hope you'll receive more bonus in upcoming days!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I did a cooking class for dater night. <endOfText>
<human> what did you all make <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While commuting to office today, one man stared at me. <endOfText>
<human> did he do it in a normal fashion or did he stared at you weird <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking to move! Just put an offer in on a place, looking forward for a positive result <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Are you trying to buy a house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife was sick the other day. so I spent the day taking care of her. <endOfText>
<human> thats good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went into that interview knowing everythng they threw at me <endOfText>
<human> That's a good way to go into an interview. Did it go well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm expecting a raise in Feb. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you can't wait. Is it a substantial raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I exercise often but as a powerlifter I do very little cardio and never really had much interest in it. A friend of mine introduced me to marathon running and wow, I like it much more than I anticipated! <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you've found a change of pace. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I couldn't get the food to feed my family, so I just stole some of the more expensive things from the store. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that you don't have enough money for food, but stealing isn't the answer! Maybe there's a local food bank you can contact. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my adult son home for a few days and just came back to a sink full of gross old dishes! <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask him to wash the dishes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i shouldnt have trusted by brother to take care of my dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, is your dog okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to put a dresser together later. <endOfText>
<human> sounds like fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is going great right now. <endOfText>
<human> That is fantastic. Anything new going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was listening to an old burned CD I found from the early 2000's. It brought back a lot of memories from that time. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it did. I would love to listen to my old cds <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember be being back in high school listening to some of those songs. <endOfText>
<human> What a fun way to reminisce.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was really hard to say goodbye to everyone at the end of the family reunion. It had been so long since we were all together. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, you're right. are you in reunion now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Pet parrot died yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to get another? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad just started college again! <endOfText>
<human> Amazing! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At night, my neighbors dog keeps barking and barking and I have no idea why. I've avoided bringing it up to him, but I'm trying to avoid drama. <endOfText>
<human> That must be annoying, what kind of dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe I failed that test. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. What kind of test was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a business meeting today. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a huge test that I was supposed to pass. I bragged to everyone that I would, but I don't think I did. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened? Why don't you think you did well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a speech I had to deliver at work in front of a big prospective client. <endOfText>
<human> Ooh that is rough having to prepare for. How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied and memorized the speech for weeks and went over it thoroughly. When it came time to deliver the speech, I nailed it! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! I'm so glad to hear that! Hopefully this boosts your confidence for next time, now you know you can do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend and I recently broke up.  It's hard being in a house by myself all the time <endOfText>
<human> oh its really frustrating and not fair <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new Warcraft expansion comes out today. <endOfText>
<human> Warcraft - that's an online role play game, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just thought of this crazy time when I had a wardrobe malfunction of my own. Have you ever had one? <endOfText>
<human> not really <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed to see a dent in my car door the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the nicest surprise last week! <endOfText>
<human> won the lottery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish! It was my birthday and a friend surprised me with a cake! <endOfText>
<human> well thats good too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> I love animals! What kind of pet does she have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a bag of candy I'm polishing off. Diabetes be damned <endOfText>
<human> uh oh! Have you checked your sugar lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> I'm jealous of you. I'm a little introverted and antisocial, and never got good at developing friendships where I could make them long-lasting and trustworthy. Good for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was able to pick up an additional scholarship to help with college tuition for this upcoming semester.. I guess any little bit helps, considering how much student loan debt I'm already in. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Anything helps as you said, keep trying for more! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset with my friend's new "relationship" <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what kind of relationship is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, she met a man online. He says he's going to marry her when he comes home from the Army but in the meantime, he's always asking her to send money to him. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, stop the relationship at all cost! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend lost a lot of weight. <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy for her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wa thinking about putting in for a transfer at my job <endOfText>
<human> Oh yea? Is it for higher pay or just needing a different scenery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just a few more hours until the work shift is over <endOfText>
<human> I feel you man.  I'm off in 1 hour and 11 minutes.  tick tock. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked around for half the day with my pants unzipped before I realized it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god, I think we've all gone through that. Did you have nice undies on though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I mean nice? Just normal boxers.   It could have been worse <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's not too bad then! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to visit my sister who goes to college, and we ate at a soul food/southern style place. It was so crowded and loud, but when we sat down to order I was really surprised.  The food was really good, and super cheap for the portions we got. <endOfText>
<human> It's pretty good! Hope you had a good time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a new puppy in my home. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy! Is it yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my friend's dog. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried driving around and looking for it? Or calling the neighbors for help? Maybe they have seen it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It has been so tough ever since I moved away from home. <endOfText>
<human> It is tough! Do you have family nearby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, no one. It's hard meeting new people. <endOfText>
<human> That would be hard.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be hard. <endOfText>
<human> It's lonesome sometimes. I'm trying to get out more though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother and his wife just had his first baby, I am over the moon for them! <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Girl or boy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car has worked in months and now school has started <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, what are you going to do?  Do you have a good bus system you can use? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear you!  I hate physical activity that seems unnecessary. <endOfText>
<human> I think I might enroll her in daycare justs for the ride to school <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just lost everything in our basement in a flood. We had torrential rain all week long.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh goodness! That is terrible to hear! Have you contacted someone to help clean it up? That can easily cause mold. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been taking care of my youngest daughter today. She has a cold. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer.  Did you make her chicken noodle soup <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This Starbucks I used to go to had horrible service--so I would always be ready with a free drink or sandwich in mind in case they forgot my order.  Worked every time lol <endOfText>
<human> They never learn, do they ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad for my friend. They were going through hard times so I bought them dinner <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of you to be supportive to your friend through struggles.  Is it a long time struggle or something sudden? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am deep cleaning my kitchen as fall arrives and wow, I pulled out my fridge and found this caked black dust bunnies and grease gunk. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well, you will get it clean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got promoted at work. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I bet you're happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I glad to see my daughter as a dancer. <endOfText>
<human> That is great, what kind of dancer is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter fell on the sidewalk yesterday and skinned her knee pretty bad. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. Is she alright now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear gun shots last night when I was sleeping. I felt pretty scared <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty unsettling.  Whereabouts do you live <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I feel a bunch of eyes on me in a room full of people it never really fazes me.  Especially if they're mostly cute girls and I just got a clean fade <endOfText>
<human> What is a clean fade <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss getting my nails done <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame. What is it that prevents you from getting them done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw one of my friends play in his rec basketball league and did very well. <endOfText>
<human> Cool Do they have tournaments? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while back, I had a car accident and it broke my ankle. I've recovered since then, but I've never been able to walk around like I used to. Last week I did my longest walk since the accident though, so I feel really good about that. <endOfText>
<human> Thats some really good progress right there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty interested after hearing someone speak at my church yesterday. They knew what they were talking about <endOfText>
<human> What was the basic jist of what they were saying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So proud of my friend for making the hockey team. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing, what level is the team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just had her first piano lesson today. <endOfText>
<human> You must be some proud of that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty good going to meet my friends for beers last night. I almost felt cocky <endOfText>
<human> Nice were they guy friends or girl friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I see a bunch of cute girls dancing at the club I try not to start hitting on all of them at the same time...I wait til the one who's been dancing the craziest and most sensual finishes dancing then I start chatting her up after <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how do they go for that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The burrito I baught from the vending machine was expired. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens, did you try to get a refund? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we went grocery shopping the other night some girl starting talking to my husband, giggling, and all that. He tried to be polite, but, she just wouldn't sto[p and I got so mad. <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you!  I would've been furious if some girl was talking to my husband that way.  Ridulous how awful some people are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finally cracked a joke about us needing to get to the grandkids party. <endOfText>
<human> Ha ha, that's a good one.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ha ha, that's a good one. <endOfText>
<human> It was funny actually. My hubby was so embarrassed because she was just too extra lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are now officially gone to college and my husband is away on a 4 day business trip. Its so quiet. <endOfText>
<human> I would hate that. Luckily my dog makes enough noise for 5! My kids are grown and gone, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been waiting all day for this maintenance guy to come. They guaranteed me he would come within this 3-hour window, and that it would be today. Looks like it'll be neither. Love wasting time! <endOfText>
<human> gosh that is horrible! Did you try to call the company? next time chooe a company that guarantees they will come or the service is free <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest sister has her learner's permit so I've been trying to teach her how to drive. You don't know true terror until you're in the passenger's seat of a 16 year old's car <endOfText>
<human> I'm dealing with the same thing right now! I had to teach her how to parralel park yesterday! It is terrifying!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm dealing with the same thing right now! I had to teach her how to parralel park yesterday! It is terrifying! <endOfText>
<human> Oh heck, I can just barely parallel park. I'm dreading teaching my sister that one, oh boy.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad loved this time of year. So it makes me think of him and miss him <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. How long has it been if I may ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put in some applications to rent out my local park for a reunion with my cousins and such. I think I got a great deal. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a fun event <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found the most honest car mechanic. <endOfText>
<human> That's more rare than diamonds.  You'd better hold on to him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get off work in 45 minutes. I can't wait. <endOfText>
<human> There is no better feeling than getting off of work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a high hopes for my son. But he fails to reach it. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. What age is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My in-laws just suddenly showed up yesterday and said they were staying for the week. I had no warning at all but I guess they were trying to make it fun, ha ha. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I would have a heart attack! Are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I graudated with a chemistry degree this year. <endOfText>
<human> Impressive, what do you plan to do with the degree? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone at work threw my lunch away today. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst, what did you eat then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes my boyfriend cooks, and the food tastes pretty gross <endOfText>
<human> Hahahahaha.  I'm sorry for laughing, but that struck me as funny.  Is he trying his best, or is he trying to get the point across that he shouldn't be cooking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wildfire blew a lot of smoke over our city, it was hard to see on the road <endOfText>
<human> I hear those wildfires are getting really bad. I hope they don't affect you too badly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager at work told me that I should expect good news soon and to meet him in his office tomorrow when I come in for work. I'm expecting it to be about a promotion I've been eagerly waiting for. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm so excited for you! I hope you get a raise too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I homeschool and am used to schooling one child but now I started 2 kids in school this year and I'm not sure if I'll be able to juggle it well. <endOfText>
<human> That would be hard, can one work independently?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be hard, can one work independently? <endOfText>
<human> For some things they both can work independently so I'm trying to pair those subjects up and then do some subjects together with both of them.  I hope I'm doing well enough! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was extremely angry on my dog. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, what did you dog do to make you angry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once at a swimming competition, I had a wardrobe malfunction in front of a lot of people <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness, that must have been humiliating.  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a buffet the other day and they kicked me out for eating too much. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, that's the dream haha. What did you eat the most of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a spot bonus at work today. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, what was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You don't know true terror until the thought enters your head, "My kids are being exceptionally quiet today..." <endOfText>
<human> Don't look a gift horse in the mouth  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't look a gift horse in the mouth ;D <endOfText>
<human> It's never good. Best case scenario, one room of your house will look like a bomb went off. Otherwise, mud, food, drink, poop will be anywhere/everywhere. FEAR! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i took my pharmacy tech certification test last week, but almost wasnt able to because i couldnt afford the $200 fee for the test. my aunt heard and reached out and paid it for me as a gift. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's wonderful that you had a supporting aunt like that. How do you think you did on your test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my son to the lake the other day, and we ended up skipping rocks. I don't know why people skip rocks; it's not really fun or anything, but we did it. It reminded me of my grandfather and I when I was a kid, and we'd do the same thing. <endOfText>
<human> haha..yeah it is kid of pointless but it is a little fun as a kid. im sure your son will remember  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> haha..yeah it is kid of pointless but it is a little fun as a kid. im sure your son will remember <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I hope so. You never really know what kind of moments someone is going to remember. I remember all sorts of things that weren't really important, but I guess they were important to me at the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty happy we are taking a trip at the end of the month. I am going to need it <endOfText>
<human> where are you guys going?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> where are you guys going? <endOfText>
<human> We are going back home to Louisiana to see friends and family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love rain. i'm sitting on the balcony and enjoying the sound and the smell of the rain, so relaxing <endOfText>
<human> Do you sleep better when it rains too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my phone in the toilet last night and now it's not functioning right. I also didn't have insurance on it which is a huge bummer, because this phone was expensive! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Have you tried the old "put it in a bag of rice" trick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped a bowl of mashed potatoes and it smashed all over the floor <endOfText>
<human> oh no! i'm sorry to hear that. I wish i could come over and help you clean up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm preparing to run a marathon. i'm not a runner and never participated in any race but i think i can do it! <endOfText>
<human> Oof, are you sure you don't want to try a half marathon first? You'll need to train quite a bit before doing a full marathon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> work transferred me to a new city. its nice so far but i dont know a single person <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry. Soon you'll get good friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm expecting a good score in my exams. <endOfText>
<human> glad to hear that. im guessing you have studied hard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't really have much direction in my life right now, I'm just trying to keep my head above water because I don't really have any other option. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is terrible. Is there anyone near you that could be of help? Maybe a family member or someone that can lend a hand or ear? I'm so sorry to hear this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to keep you waiting I had a technical issue. I just got a new deep fryer, and I fried my very first turkey today. I know it doesn't seem like much, but I am very excited about it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey. You do seem like you would enjoy that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy that you got a new turkey friar and fried your first turkey. You do seem like you would enjoy that. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for understanding. It's been annoying my family but I bet they're excited for me as well. I love frying birds that's for sure haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Three of my friends are due to have babies and I still haven't been able to get pregnant. I don't understand how they get pregnant so easily and nothing is wrong with me. <endOfText>
<human> I understand how you feel.  My sister struggled to get pregnant. She did invitro twice.    <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I understand how you feel.  My sister struggled to get pregnant. She did invitro twice. <endOfText>
<human> I'm on my 5th cycle of invitro.  Did she have a baby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to going home and relaxing on the couch. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds wonderful!  Nothing better than putting your feet up at the end of the day.  Think you might watch some tv? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son peed on me the other night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm sure it was awful at the time, but it'll be a good story when he grows up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe my friend made the team and I did not. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. What type of team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew came over today and I noticed he was wearing an outfit that I had given to my sister years ago when my own son grew out of it. It reminded me of the times when my son was still a toddler. <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing, how old is your son these days? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello! I just got a new neighbor who seems very nice. I have to leave town for a bit, and they offered to watch after my pets. I'm going out on a limb doing this but I've accepted their offer. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds risky but at the same time if it works out convenient! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah the convenience is certainly weighing heavily on my decision making, but they seemed nice and they have pets of their own. I hope it works out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I cried at work because I was really stressed about a project <endOfText>
<human> I've never cried at work, but I've wanted to lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to volunteer at the local animal shelter <endOfText>
<human> You're doing good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents went to abroad. <endOfText>
<human> Where did they go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to jury duty later this week. I am real nervous about it <endOfText>
<human> I bet you'll do great.  I would be nervous too.  Hopefully it won't be anything too serious and more cut and dry decision.  Have you gone before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the hospital last month when i got really sick and I was charged 400 dollars more than they said it would be. I am ticked off to say the least. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when they do that. They make it so hard to pay for <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got told on short notice that I've got a bunch of people coming over to eat dinner. I just got back from the store and I'm ready to do this! <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy. I know just how you feel. Could you persuade them to go to a restaurant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Husky was out in my backyard thats been her yard for over 2 years now and she randomly jumped over the 4ft chain link fence. I had no idea that was possible but she saw a stupid duck and I guess needed to chase after it. <endOfText>
<human> That would be scary! Were you able to catch her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started learning to rock climb at a local indoor climbing facility near me and finally got to the top of the tallest wall! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thats so cool! I wish i could rock climb. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my mom. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you lie to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to the upcoming weekend. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you on that. I'm visiting my girlfriend, but she still has to work, so the weekend is really the only time we can hang out. Do you have any special plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really not looking forward to taking my public speech class in college this semester. I feel like I'm going to get up there and vomit all over myself. Last time I had to talk in front of a group of people, I was so nervous, people were laughing because my knees were visibly shaking. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh, I feel the same to be honest. I hate, hate talking in front of a crowd. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat sat on my bag right after she came out of her litter box, gross <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, but that made me laugh a little bit. I've never been able to get into the idea of cats as pets just because they're so independent and determined to do whatever the want. Doesn't seem like they can listen to any direction you try to give them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter needed a computer for school and we were trying to figure out what to get her that would make it all the way through college. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been reading reviews online? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been doing a ton of research and I think I'm finally going to take the first steps to begin investing in the stock market and try my hand at day trading. <endOfText>
<human> Hey! Good luck to you! That's got to be tough!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey! Good luck to you! That's got to be tough! <endOfText>
<human> It's a very complex subject, but I think I've gained a solid understanding of the ins and outs. I guess I won't know if the research paid off until I try! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For what it's worth I'm proud of you! <endOfText>
<human> Well thanks, that means a lot to me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm long-distance with my girlfriend right now, where she lives almost 1,000 miles away. I live on the east coast, she lives in the midwest. She has a good job, and I'll just be graduating college, so she's established. She's determined that I need to move to her, but I don't feel great about the idea. <endOfText>
<human> That is a pretty big decision to make. Did she spring this up on you or was this something you knew she'd eventually want? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm an aspiring actor and I have yet to land any large roles. I feel like I've been doing well and I've been at this for at least two years now. <endOfText>
<human> That profession takes a lot of courage and a unique set of skills and personality. That's pretty cool that you took that route--sometimes I think about the "what if" of if I took that route. Pretty sure most people have that fantasy, but only the people brave enough actually go on the path to do it, like you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to go buy a dog bed today and a few others things I needed/wanted. <endOfText>
<human> Ooh, that's awesome. It's great when you can spend a little extra on the fun things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time of year takes me back to when I was a kid. I always looked forward to football with my dad <endOfText>
<human> I always wished I could do that with my dad. But he had a stroke in his 40s, and was never in good enough health to do it with me. That and I was kind of shy and introverted, so I never made friends to do it with, either. It stinks to miss the memories, but I'm glad to hear you got to have them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Summer is almost over. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel better now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have to get a high mark on this exam. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I smoked a cigarette today, after two months with out smoking. I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> That's no good, what made you smoke? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt so good when I babysat my friends cat. <endOfText>
<human> I'm an animal lover myself. I have a cat who just had four kittens. They're adorable! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I stopped at a gas station on the way home from work just to grab a snack and while I was there the place was robbed at gun point. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrifying, are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother bought the car i had my eye on. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, dang, did he know you were trying to buy it also? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous with people that have gyms in their homes. <endOfText>
<human> well you can improvise and make everyday household items into a gym that work just a well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dude cut me off in traffic turning left in too a store..had to slam on my brakes.. then had the nerve to beep back at me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That sounds scary! I'd be mad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a dentist appointment next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oi...I don't like doctors or the dentists. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really stressed that I'll have enough money to cover the bills this month. <endOfText>
<human> That is a stress we all go through! It's hard! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow's an exciting day for my family. We're sending our two youngest children to a new school! <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! Tell me about the new school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought my partner some socks today. <endOfText>
<human> Fresh socks are a treat for the feet! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I watch ahead on a tv show if there's a cliffhanger. I should wait to watch it with my boyfriend but I don't haha <endOfText>
<human> lol! My mom used to do that with books, she would read the ending first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh well that's just spoiling it for herself haha. <endOfText>
<human> Nope she still reads it all. Same thing you do silly! lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So happy I got my momma dog a new bed today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great! I got my cat a new bed and she won't touch it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my son's favorite toy. we were playing and i accidentaly fell on it... he was crying so much i feel horrible <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I can see how that might make you feel really bad. Was it replaceable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty upset I got a flat on the way to work today. <endOfText>
<human> oh no! that is horrible and those things always seem to happen when on your way to work or somewhere important <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my new 2018 subaru WRX is going to be delivered today!! i CANT WAIT!! <endOfText>
<human> Woohoo! That sounds like it'll be a blast to drive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it is so much fun! <endOfText>
<human> Just make sure you drive safely! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Proud of my son for scoring two goals in his soccer game this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was exciting to watch <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom was arrested as a kid. It brought shame on me and my family <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I'm sorry, well you can redeem your family and be a good influence to your community! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew it was going to be sunny today. I had a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> A good feeling about the weather? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to go on a trip for my birthday <endOfText>
<human> That's neat!  Where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mom's going to be mad, I stole some dinosaur toys <endOfText>
<human> Maybe she will go easy on you, if this isn't something you do often.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe she will go easy on you, if this isn't something you do often. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i'm sitting here relaxing and IRS calls me telling me if i don't pay them 3000$ they will arrest me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, a new coworker keep looking at me in weird way. I feel very uncomfortable. <endOfText>
<human> you should probably talk to that co worker and if it doesn't stop i would report it to the HR <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a bit of a rough weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've recently started volunteering at a homeless shelter. I have to say it is one of the most rewarding decisions I have ever made in life. <endOfText>
<human> That's a wonderful thing to do. What kind of tasks do you do there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my mom some temporary teeth. <endOfText>
<human> Temporary teeth? How long do those last? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was given a promotion at work today. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Congratulations! I'm sure you earned it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im a little disappointed. I just got the call that the job I wanted went with someone else. <endOfText>
<human> I hate to hear that. Did the person that got the job deserve it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I am getting second thoughts about going on my trip. I am leaving for two months but I am getting nervous about going. <endOfText>
<human> Where are you going? Are you scared of going on the plane or going to a new place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like a new perfume that I've tried but it's so expensive I don't know if I should get it <endOfText>
<human> Maybe if you search some more it will go on sale. But if you really like it you should get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really hoping I enjoy this new World of Warcraft expansion as much as I've been excepting to! <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh I've been checking it out too!  What side are you going with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager has taken my coworker for a work trip to New York. I was also suppose to go with them. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. That sucks. NY is really fun. Why couldn't you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't understand why I didn't go. He said that will take both of us and then one week before going he have changed his mind. He told that he doesn't have enough money. <endOfText>
<human> I would be kind of mad and dissappointed with him. You could have offered to pay your own way! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I saw 2 men playing basketball and one of them hit a long range 3 pointer <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool! Was it a professional game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No it was a pickup game but the one who it the shot is playing college basketball. Hopefully he can get me some tickets <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like he's a good player! You should ask him for some tickets! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A manager I do not like was working at the store I love today. \ <endOfText>
<human> Aw man. I am guessing you already went to the store. Did you have to interact with the manager? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! It can make it a bit uncomfortable to shop there. It's the only one of it's kind in my area! So it's a bummer! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that stinks. Is it a store you go often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been weight lifting for 6 years now and I can finally say I'm very proud of my physique! I'm 30 years old and look better now than I did at 20! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! I am also working hard at getting super fit too at 35! It is harder the older you are but totally doable if you're committed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I keep seeing a poor little black kitty running around outside every night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, he's probably lost. Maybe you should take him in and feed him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He won't come near me and my house can't hold another cat. I will feed him though. I have big dogs, so not sure if he'd come near my house :( I will try though! <endOfText>
<human> At least you're concerned and interested in helping. Some people would ignore the poor little kitty and just let him die. Very kind of you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm surprised with how clean the house was after I came home from my trip. My wife is the best! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Would have been a bummer to come home to a messy house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got a new job in a city three hours away in an industry that I've never worked in yet. I'm a bit nervous, but at the same time I'm excited. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, I'm sure you will do great.  it's always nerve-racking the first day of work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She went in for a kiss but I declined. <endOfText>
<human> Why'd you turn her down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Okay, this is going to be a weird question, but did you guys ever have any Yo-yo sales people come to your school as a kid? <endOfText>
<human> I did actually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just went a job interview. I feel it went really well. I really wish that I get it. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous with people who have a washer and dryer. Going to the laundromat stinks! <endOfText>
<human> I know. I just went yesterday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work from home <endOfText>
<human> Nice, that's very convenient, do you enjoy it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice, that's very convenient, do you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<human> I do. My daughter has been talkong t me for abot 20 minutes. She knows that I'm not lisstening. yet she continues <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy when I eat gourmet ice cream, but it's so expensive <endOfText>
<human> Mmmm, I love gourmet ice cream.  If I didn't have self control I would be like 800 pounds from it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so grateful for video games, they have brought so much joy to my life in stressful moments in life. <endOfText>
<human> I love video games too, what's your favorite. I really like "Don't Starve" by Klei. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have pretty bad social anxiety. Today while I was paying for my groceries, my anxiety acted up and I ended up giving the cashier the wrong amount of money TWICE. I felt like just running out of there! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that must have been pretty awful. Do you not have self checkout at your grocery store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling good about my money making skills. <endOfText>
<human> How are they? Are you doing pretty well in that area? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty good right now in life, couldn't ask for anything more. I'm very low maintenance. <endOfText>
<human> Fantastic! Being grateful is the way to be happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our new baby newborn pup here is getting bigger everyday! <endOfText>
<human> I love dogs, what kind of puppy is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's nice listening to old music. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, I enjoy stuff from my childhood. What kind of music are you listening to, country, rock, something else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest children are starting in a new school tomorrow, and I'm kind of nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! Who do you think it's going to have the most separation anxiety, you or them? Be honest! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so tired of being abused. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible that you are being abused. Who is treating you so poorly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So annoying to hear people talking when I'm trying to listen to my teacher. <endOfText>
<human>    Some people have no respect for otheres. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some people have no respect for otheres. <endOfText>
<human> They really don't, especially since we're paying for our educations here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a restaurant's bathroom today for lunch and it was absolutely disgusting. Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in months. <endOfText>
<human> Thats sick. Did you report them? They are supposed to have them cleaned several times per day or they can be shut down <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have so much to clean and get ready before summer ends! <endOfText>
<human> End of summer cleaning, I know that feeling, got to get ready for the school year! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm always nervous about public speaking <endOfText>
<human> What do you have to speak on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got such a nice pair of shoes. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice, what kind of shoes are they? Heels? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should be receiving a bonus for how well I have been doing at work. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I hope you do get a nice bonus. Sounds like you work pretty hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited, my husband got promoted to a Lieutenant in the Navy! <endOfText>
<human> That is so awesome. Congratulations. Any big plans to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My moms full coverage car insurance won't pay for ANY dental work after her car accident. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, that is so frustrating! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband goes away for months at a time due to being in the Military. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god..I don't know how you military wives do it. I just can't imagine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a bouquet from her boyfriend the other day <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so sweet.  What was the occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the family to the airport today. <endOfText>
<human> Where are they headed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Having this new baby puppy around reminds me of how fragile life is. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's cute, how old is he/she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm disappointed with my new tablet I got, it bugs and restarts like every 30 minutes. Might need to take it back. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, do you plan on getting a new one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I might just splurge and get the new iPad, I never buy apple products but at least that is reliable. <endOfText>
<human> You should, my Ipad has great charge time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling good about my math test. <endOfText>
<human> That's always a good feeling.  If you don't feel confident going in, you're in trouble! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet gecko died. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's sad. I love any and all animals, I'm sorry <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Customer service sent me two bad vacuums now. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to keep them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty good about this past weekend. I had a date I was looking forward to it <endOfText>
<human> Oh how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently took an 8 hour flight and was so pleased that the airline offered free movies to watch via phone/tablet <endOfText>
<human> What movie did you end up watching? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling real good about myself in this new jacket. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! Where did you buy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My five year old daughter is an extremely picky eater. <endOfText>
<human> What does she like to eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, I could not handle that at all <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Were you close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am content with my life right now, everything is going well for the most part <endOfText>
<human> It is nice to enjoy life  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is nice to enjoy life <endOfText>
<human> That is true, it is a nice change of scenery from a few years ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared and alone when my aunt died. It was so random <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, I am sorry for your loss... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So proud of us, we both made the soccer team! <endOfText>
<human> What team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very lonely before I met my friends and current girlfriend <endOfText>
<human> What is her name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad, tomorrow I have to go back to school and I'm going to miss the summer with my old friends. <endOfText>
<human> Awh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends at school?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awh, I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have any friends at school? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I do, thankfully, but not as close as my old friends from high school. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger I had been trying to get pregnant for a long time, but wasn't having luck. Suddenly my husband and I found out we were going to have a baby. We were so happy. <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud, when did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't mean too but I broke my moms vase. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Did you tell her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So sad that my dog passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Awe.. I'm sorry.   I know how you must feel. I've got a dog myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a call about about an application I put in for a new job today. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going sky diving this weekend! I am super pumped, but a little nervous because I have to put a lot of faith in the sky diving instructor. <endOfText>
<human> That is for sure, but that should be cool, how much does it cost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was alone before meeting my girlfriend and friend group <endOfText>
<human> That must have been quite lonely.  How are you doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I setup a job interview for next week. I think i'm going to get the job. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I hope you do, it's always nerve-racking when it comes to the interview and whether or not your get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend, a guy totally drunk has hit very badly my car. <endOfText>
<human> Are you saying that a drunk guy hit your car, and that it is very bad? If so, that really sucks and I am sorry. Did he have insurance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I have been house hunting for a few months now. <endOfText>
<human> Did you find anything interesting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ve been at my new job for weeks <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow thats great, how do you like it so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the doctor's for my annual check-up, I always think they're going to find something wrong. <endOfText>
<human> What might be wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the Eagles can win the superbowl again this year, they are looking really good <endOfText>
<human> I'm not too familiar with football, who is their star player? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to be happy all week. I have family coming into town <endOfText>
<human> Who is coming? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy with my life right now, everything is going well for the most par <endOfText>
<human> What are you happy about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to pass my drivers test for work. I studied hard for it <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like you were very prepared!! Good job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The bonus for everyone at my company was last week, and you have to have been with the company for over 90 days to get it. My friend was at 94 days and I was at 88 days. It really stinks, I have to wait another year. <endOfText>
<human> I guess it can be a learning experience <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ha maybe to be a good sport but I still feel its not fair. <endOfText>
<human> No its not fair at all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising when i got approved for the week off <endOfText>
<human> The whole week? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally get to have a night alone <endOfText>
<human> thats cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat ignores me sometimes and just stares into the distance <endOfText>
<human> Cats can be odd creatures <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have faith its going to be a good week. The weather will at least be nice <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, summer is a great season, have you been on vacation at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor brought me dinner tonight <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that was very nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking the Eagles can repeat this year, I hope so! <endOfText>
<human> Careful. Lightning never strikes twice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow the last of my children FINALLY start school. Time to relax! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, enjoy the peace and quiet! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got drunk over the weekend and I had to take care of him. It was pretty irritating <endOfText>
<human> How drunk was he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel guilty about breaking our television <endOfText>
<human> Was it an accident <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to the Fall weather. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! This heat is unbearable! What is your favorite thing about fall? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother surprised me last week with a nice present. I loved it <endOfText>
<human> what was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i saw my dog had gotten loose <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you get it back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty mad last week when my apartment was not sprayed like it was supposed to. Now I have bigs <endOfText>
<human> Did you have someone come in to spray it? You can ask for a refund maybe <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker got the promotion I wanted <endOfText>
<human> I have been there. It can be irritating <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a first state with a girl I don't know on friday. I haven't been on a date in a while. <endOfText>
<human> check out some vids on youtube. im sure you will be fine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We'll it's really hard because the last date I was one was with my ex-wife. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea i can understand that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was thankful that i got the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> That most have been really nice. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working hard to better things for my family. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you!  I know that can be difficult, but it will pay off in the end <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out I was accepted into medical school!  I have been working hard for this chance to become a surgeon <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. What a wonderful achievement. If I could do it all over again, this is what I'd want to do too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some old pictures from when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looked through them and reminisced. <endOfText>
<human> ah thats always nice to do every once in a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw my door had been hit <endOfText>
<human> Some jerk ding your car in the parking lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes they did. <endOfText>
<human> ... and i bet they didn't even leave a note or anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty happy over the weekend I got to smoke a cigar and read some comics <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like you had a really good time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hired a tree guy to trim some really high branches. He monkeyed up that tree super fast! It was amazing to watch! <endOfText>
<human> Those guys and girls tend to work hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have lost over 30 pounds in the last year <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! How did you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate some bad meat this morning. It made me really sick <endOfText>
<human> I hope your okay! Do you think you have food poising? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died 6 months ago <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that, it's always tough to lose a pet.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sorry to hear that, it's always tough to lose a pet. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah and what made it worse is that I just found out about it. My parents are jerks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had cereal for breakfast this morning. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of cereal was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to have some medical tests done and I'd like to get them over with as soon as possible. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine you do. Do you have a needle fear? Even if you dont they still hurt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I flew for the first in a long time a few months ago. I was scared just a bit beforehand <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on working up the nerve to fly! Did you enjoy the flight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait until tomorrow! I'm going to my favorite amusement park! <endOfText>
<human>  Are you going to ride roller coasters <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes!!! The roller coasters are my favorite part! <endOfText>
<human> I do agree with you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Are you going to ride roller coasters <endOfText>
<human> Yes!!! The roller coasters are my favorite part!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my car dooe <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awful. Did it happen in a parking lot maybe? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was kinda shocked the other night to run into my boss while I was out at a bar. <endOfText>
<human> did you all have some drinks together <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My birthday was last week and I thought everyone forgot about it. <endOfText>
<human> did you get a suprise party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when i had to miss my sons game <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were, but I am sure you had a good reason. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if you are like us, but we have printed photos in a big tub that desperately need to be sorted.  So I tried to do that today but I didn't get very far. <endOfText>
<human> I have the same tub sitting in the attic. I have no idea what to do with all the photos! Are you creating collages or albums? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish it was Fall already. <endOfText>
<human> too hot outside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising when i was able to get a cheap flight to Orlando <endOfText>
<human> Where were you coming from?...and how cheap was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> san antonio, $49 <endOfText>
<human> That's a steal. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a loud bang outside my house last night, I thought someone was trying to break in. <endOfText>
<human> what was it ? lightening perhaps <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im exhausted from work , they gave me such a giant work loud , i was surprised at myself for even finishing <endOfText>
<human> That's tough, is there anyone else there that can help you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> they dont trust anyone there building the furniture so after i build it , i have to carry it up ladders and place it on racks on the wall <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds really physically demanding, you must be quite strong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A fly landed in my drink while I was grilling some chicken for dinner outside. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yuck! I hate flies.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yuck! I hate flies. <endOfText>
<human> I know. Ruined the whole drink. :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha what was the drink? <endOfText>
<human> Jim beam and coke. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was preparing to paint my bedroom furniture and I unearthed so many dust bunnies from under my bed! <endOfText>
<human> It's never too late for some late summer cleaning! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I should have done this a long time ago! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like it.  Are you going to sleep better tonight knowing its clean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha I think so! <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think about the past this time of the year. It makes me miss my parents <endOfText>
<human> How come? Do you not live with them anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made twice what I usually make at my second job this week! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's awesome! Any special reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a health checking coming up this next week and am a bit antsy about it. <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything goes well but I'm sure it will. Don't worry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a doctor's appointment on thursday <endOfText>
<human> I hope it goes well, are you sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The end of an era! My messiest children, tomorrow, finally... start school. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea sounds like a great time of the year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time of year makes me miss being a kid. And hanging out with my parents <endOfText>
<human> That's funny, I was thinking almost the same thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time of year always makes me reminisce. <endOfText>
<human> What do you think about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a skinny little stray cat outside the pizza place yesterday so now we have a new cat lol <endOfText>
<human> What breed is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've started working with a lathe and I made this wooden cup with it. That doesn't sound like much but using a lathe is so hard! So everything I drink out of it tastes that much better, haha. <endOfText>
<human> What is a lathe, I am not familiar with it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like the Eagles can win the Superbowl this year, I am not sure though <endOfText>
<human> Are you a big eagles fan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had car trouble over the weekend. It was so irritating <endOfText>
<human> There's nothing worse! What was wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I was in a hotel room and I went to take a shower and there was hair in the drain and I gagged. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that does sound so gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the lego movies! <endOfText>
<human> I've never seen them. What do you love about them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hmm I may have to check them out then! <endOfText>
<human> You should. You won't be dissappointed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roomate finally graudated with an engineering degree. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congrats to them. Are you worried you will loose your roommate?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, congrats to them. Are you worried you will loose your roommate? <endOfText>
<human> I'm not worried. I'm ready to live on my own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday my brother saw the person that robbed his home, was tried to kick down the door and pull out the  crackhead from his house , cops were looking for my brother all night <endOfText>
<human> That sound like it was a bit rash. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope that my children have better lives than I have had. <endOfText>
<human> i dont have kids , but i feel the same way u do if i had kids that is <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty alone last night. I guess everyone I knew was busy <endOfText>
<human> did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw my gate left open <endOfText>
<human> Was anything missing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not make it to church yesterday. I still feel bad about it <endOfText>
<human> It's okay. There's always Wednesday service or online sermons you can watch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a doctor's appointment today and another on thursday. it's really working my nerves <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything goes well for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am watching "i am a killer" on netflix <endOfText>
<human> I have seen the previews. Is it good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised by the weather this morning. I was not expecting sunny <endOfText>
<human> What were you expecting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was alone a lot as a child. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate.  You must have been lonely.  Has your situation improved since then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my wallet in my office today <endOfText>
<human> Can you go back and get it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just noticed someone backed into my car in my parking lot! <endOfText>
<human> WHAT, did you catch them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when someone hit my car. i think you backed up into mine. <endOfText>
<human> It might have been the same person! We should stake out in the bushes out there and see who it was! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So happy my friends threw me a surprise party. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! What was the occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i was told i couldnt leave work on time <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is getting married. It makes me happy for him <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i dont know how my friends out here cheating on there girls , i never cheat on mine its happened to me in the past and it hurt <endOfText>
<human> Some people know they can do better so they shop around I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i dont see it that way , but everyone has there own views <endOfText>
<human> I guess. Or it could be they are ready to move on but need to know someone else will be interested in them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sitting at work the other day last week and suddenly a giant cockroach ran across the floor! <endOfText>
<human> I would have screamed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get lonely when my kids are at school sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah I can see how it could be lonely. It's so quiet when they are gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That was scary! <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter received a scholarship for 8th grade at a local private school. <endOfText>
<human> Are you proud of her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i was told i couldnt leave work on time <endOfText>
<human> Never fun when someone tried to change your schedule. Life's unfair sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love when Fall starts coming in. <endOfText>
<human> I hate it. I want it to be 100 and humid all the time. I thrive in the heat <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset that my partner has put me through so much..and now going through more while he is away and trying to get treatment. <endOfText>
<human> What are they getting treatment for <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a trainer at my gym help a person. He knew what he was doing which was nice <endOfText>
<human> What did they help them with, just how to do certain moves? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend gave me his old computer because mine broke. That was so nice of him considering I cant afford one right now. <endOfText>
<human> That is very kind. Now many people like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I couldnt believe it. I am so thankful. <endOfText>
<human> You will have to return the favor sometime.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised this morning when I woke up before my alarm. <endOfText>
<human> Do you usually sleep in? I heard it's better to wake up naturally. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ever go back and watch old movies? <endOfText>
<human> I sure do! What are some of your favorites? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone asked me how me and my fiance met the other day and it had been awhile since I had even thought about it because it was over 8 years ago. While I was telling them about it I got that feeling you get when your remembering something, almost like adrenaline but in a calm way. I dont get that kind of feeling much anymore so it was odd when I did. <endOfText>
<human> How did you guys end up meeting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to win the lottery this week <endOfText>
<human> That would be a dream <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea it would be cool. i would move to hawaii <endOfText>
<human> That is a place I have always wanted to go to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt so sad for my brother , when he came home bloody after he got jumped <endOfText>
<human> What happened to him ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm fairly happy where my life is right now. At least it's headed in the right direction. <endOfText>
<human> thats great to hear, im happy for you and your accomplishements  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats great to hear, im happy for you and your accomplishements <endOfText>
<human> It's hard and long work, but at least I'm making it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just made the team at my local school, I'm happy. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the best wife ever. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to give a big speech tomorrow in class. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's always tough, are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the new Super Smash Brothers game to be released. <endOfText>
<human> When will it be released? I have not heard of that one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting more mad at my landlord. They are not doing what they promise to do <endOfText>
<human> Have you checked your lease agreement, they may be required by law to follow through. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was wanting meatloaf for dinner all day long and couldn't wait to get home to start cooking it <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry but I'm so not a fan of meatloaf. Do you have a good recipe? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister is a hooligan I swear. <endOfText>
<human> who did she beat down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband aggravates me when he leaves his clothes all over the floor! <endOfText>
<human> yeah that's a bad habit. I don't like it either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I participated in local city half marathon yesterday <endOfText>
<human> That's impressive, how did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time of the year makes me think of the past. I think about football and my parents <endOfText>
<human> I keep forgetting that football season is right around the corner. Did you play when you were younger? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was irritated last week. My landlord seemed to avoid me <endOfText>
<human> Really? Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has really good job, but she makes more money than me. <endOfText>
<human> Are you okay with that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I'm really envious of her. I make next to nothing. <endOfText>
<human> Have you talked to her about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got such a bad mark on my latest test. <endOfText>
<human> Awh, I'm sorry. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to church yesterday really made me feel better. I am looking forward to this week now <endOfText>
<human> What church do you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe my brother got that hat! <endOfText>
<human> What hate did he get <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I nailed a sales meeting last week. I just knew what to expect <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome that you were so prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cleaned out my basement and found that some mice had made a home in some boxes <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, those are so gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i shouildnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is a big of a hot head. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my performance appraisal tomorrow at work! I am really nervous! <endOfText>
<human> How long have you been working for the company? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So Im a little bummed out today. I couldnt secure tickets to see my favorite band. They sold out really quick. <endOfText>
<human> That is indeed a bummer. Maybe you can pick some up on a ticket trading website? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> everytime i go to mcdonalds they always get my orders wrong , leaving me angry its my fault for always going there <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should go somewhere else <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i would but its right next to my job, its my fault honestly but as a customer they should be consistent <endOfText>
<human> Yeah you would think they would be good by now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad for skipping church last week, My brother really wanted me to go with him <endOfText>
<human> i have never been to church , but i understand where your coming from <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my aunt died a few years ago, it really hurt me <endOfText>
<human> That must've been awful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Old movies are the best. <endOfText>
<human> They really are. What is your favorite <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll sign a new contract at my workplace soon, so yeah, pretty excited about that. <endOfText>
<human> Ooh congratulations, what for?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ooh congratulations, what for? <endOfText>
<human> Just another year (and hopefully a small raise!) at the company. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start school tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Matty ran away from home! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Who is Matty? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home last night <endOfText>
<human> Do you live in a bad area or a big city? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am already nervous about tomorrow. It might rain hard <endOfText>
<human> If you have to leave just be very careful on the road. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What kind of animal is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the new Super Smash Brothers game to be released. <endOfText>
<human> when does it come out? i wanna get that too and the new online service <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I think about my landlord, I get mad. They have not done all of the things they have promised <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that's definitely not OK. Have you thought about contacting a tenants rights group to advocate on your behalf? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's crazy the amount of drivers running a red light near my house every day. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very dangerous <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my brother got his new job I was happy for him. He deserved it <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I bet he worked hard for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> i need to start playing too , that would be awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i never get tired of watching the original texas chainsaw massacre i watned it with my dad and it always brings back good memories <endOfText>
<human> never seen it. dont like scary movies much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I might not be able to make a trip at the end of the month. It makes me feel pretty bad <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that! What's stopping you from taking the trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so ashamed! My son baked cookies yesterday to have today after school and I ate them all! <endOfText>
<human> I guess that means they were good at least <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a sales meeting tomorrow. I think I knew what to expect to. <endOfText>
<human> Are you looking forward to it or nah? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I broke my arm in the past, I just knew mt brother was going to get me to the hospital. I had all the faith in the world <endOfText>
<human> did he get you there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> You sound like a good person then. What kind of pet is it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the dealership to buy a truck a little while ago, but I wasn't nervous. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, did you use one of those car buying services or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I just knew exactly what I wanted, and how much I wanted to pay for it <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up getting a good deal? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somebodies kid had a dirty diaper on my flight last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the street yesterday to get lunch and tripped and fell.  A few people saw me and laughed <endOfText>
<human> that stinks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> That's cool!  I love animals <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew it was going to be a good weekend. I had a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> I didn't understand. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my wife have been to have a child for the past year. I just learned last week that I can't have kid. It is terrible. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you had to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared by the movie the Grudge, even to this day it still scares me today <endOfText>
<human> never seen it, is it that scary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> thanks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY lease is almost up on my tiny apartment <endOfText>
<human> What will you do next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We often get bad storms in the fall and spring. <endOfText>
<human> You have tornadoes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my aunt so much. <endOfText>
<human> Did she pass away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband had to go to a conference for the entire week all the way across the country. <endOfText>
<human> Where did he end up flying too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother came home sick today. I just wanted to make sure he is going to be okay with the medicine I gave him <endOfText>
<human> how is he doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i missed my sons game <endOfText>
<human> Why did you miss it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a used car from my old neighbor last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What kind of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of my brother, he has overcome a lot in his life, and that is hard to do sometimes <endOfText>
<human> Its good to have supportive siblings like you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my date over the weekend was going to go well. We just clicked through messages before <endOfText>
<human> Are you gojng to meet them again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have this oral surgery once, I remember it very well because it was an uncommon procedure. They had to go up in my gums and attached a chain to one of my eye teeth and sew it back up and then once everything healed the orthodontist pulled the tooth down slowly over several months by attaching the chain to my braces. <endOfText>
<human> I hate the dentist, they poke and prod so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe my friends got me a stick. <endOfText>
<human> Like a stick shift car? You got some pretty rich friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising when i found cheap tickets to las vegas <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was a nice deal to find <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised when I got to the gym this morning. It was not packed as usual <endOfText>
<human> were you able to make use of all the equipment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter recently graduated from law school! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's great! She still has to pass the bar though right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in some dog poop when I went on a walk yesterday, ugh. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst!  People need to be more considerate and clean up after their dogs <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a terrible candy craving so I stole some from the store. <endOfText>
<human> You actually stole them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to show my brother I cared about him. So I bought him a new jacket <endOfText>
<human> oh thats sweet. did he like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i saw my brother pulling up with a brand new BMW <endOfText>
<human> Why were you upset <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched Spice World yesterday for the first time in at least 15 years <endOfText>
<human> Did you like it? I never liked it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That day, my best friend broke mt bicycle. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That's awful.  How did they manage that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I look at old photographs, I can't help but think of the past. <endOfText>
<human> good memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the good ole days <endOfText>
<human> Yes, life was so much easier then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in tobacco spit today when I went out to check my mail barefoot! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, that is disgusting.  I'm guessing it wasn't your own? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new job offer, but I don't know what I should do. <endOfText>
<human> Would you be making more money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've worn the same shade of lipstick for years and I found out today its being discontinued. <endOfText>
<human> Its a good time to branch out then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather the last few days has been irritating. I just want it to be sunny <endOfText>
<human> Has it been rainy there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to get cheap tickets to orlando <endOfText>
<human> Ohh, how did you get that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very upset last month <endOfText>
<human> what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got back from the nicest supper with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> ohh, nice. Where did you guys go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I felt ruined <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I just watched the new Avengers movie. Have you seen it? <endOfText>
<human> I haven't, did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I was pretty amazed at both the plot and how good the acting was. <endOfText>
<human> Interesting, maybe I'll check it out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally tripped while walking into a restaurant for dinner, totally ruined my appetite. <endOfText>
<human> Man that really stinks. I hope that you are ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What kind of pet was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do get sad this time of the year. This was my dad favorite month <endOfText>
<human> I assume your dad has passed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm playing the new WoW xpac :D <endOfText>
<human> What is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very envious on my best friend <endOfText>
<human> It's OK we all get jealous sometimes. What did you envy about your best friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a necklace today that I got 16  years ago <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Have you been looking for it for a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my son use my debit card to go get pizza with his friends tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Did he buy 600 pizzas? lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started myself a 401k! <endOfText>
<human> Way to go. You will be glad you did that in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That market has been really lately so you should see it grow. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so, I'm planning on moving to Florida when I retire to yell at tourists and complain about the neighborhood kids being on my lawn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last time I was in my hometown I drove in front the grocery store I used to work at. It was so cool to see it was still up and running. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Have they upgraded it any or does it look the same? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew started the 10th grade this week <endOfText>
<human> How exciting. Kid's grow up to fast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a job as a pooper scooper. <endOfText>
<human> oh yea ? does it pay well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive seeing this guy eat a 3lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow, that IS impressive.  I can't believe people can eat that much.  Was he in a contest? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to visit this appartment that I want to rent. The appartment was totally different from pictures. It was very dirty. <endOfText>
<human> Eww, I've had that happen. Did you say something to the person showing you the apartment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an wonderful husband and two precious kids. They are everything to me. <endOfText>
<human> You are so lucky. They must bring you great joy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They really do.  I couldn't have gotten to hard times without them. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing. I am sure they appreciate you too. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My brother taught me some things about beer last week. It was pretty cool <endOfText>
<human> what did you learn <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just feel for an email scam <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hate to hear that. What were they trying to sell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling a little sad about my son turning two in a few months. <endOfText>

<human> Time goes by so fast! <endOfText>

<human> What do you guys do for work together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Harvard rejected me last night, <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That's not your journey then.  Do you have other places you applied? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I had to cancel on my friend earlier. He really wanted to hang out <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Thats rough. Im sure you will be better in the long run. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so but right now it doesn't feel good at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found this old mix CD I made a long time ago. It really brought be back to when I first made it. <endOfText>
<human> What songs were on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They cut me from the team last night. <endOfText>
<human> What team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked this morning when I woke up this morning. I really overslept in a bad way <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate when that happens! Did you turn off your alarm in your sleep? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought a pair of jeans and wasn't expecting them to fit very well but they did <endOfText>
<human> Its always nice to find clothes that fit well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to win the lottery tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Have you won before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mad when the Eagles fired Chip Kelly, but I suppose looking back it was the right move <endOfText>
<human> you know what they say about chip kelly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been eating a lot of sugar free candy recently and it made my bowels loose if you know what I mean. <endOfText>
<human> Haha I know exactly what you mean! My uncle pranked his coworker once with a bag of sugar free candy. I feel for you, seriously. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man that is really bad. I feel sorry for laughing. <endOfText>
<human> Don't, it was several years ago now and I use it as great story at parties.  People love it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my mom so much <endOfText>
<human> That's a great feeling I love mine as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to put on Off! spray the other day before I went out and a bunch of bugs bit me up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Are you itching all over now?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no!  Are you itching all over now? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I try not to scratch a lot and I put rubbing alcohol on the bumps. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My three month backpacking trip is coming up but I feel like it might not be smart for me to go. <endOfText>
<human> Where is it taking place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros, it is going to be so good! <endOfText>
<human> They are making another one? Those games were always so successful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That was scary having to change my tire in the middle of the road! <endOfText>
<human> yea that sucks.. feeling those cars zoom by you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i had to work last weekend <endOfText>
<human> What did you miss because of work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost a bunch of weight in just a few months. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome!  I know how hard it is to lose weight.  She  must be so happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel you.  That's how my body functions too. Slow weight loss or not at all.  Its also dangerous to lose weight too quickly so don't wish it for yourself too fast.  Slowly and steadily keeps you from getting lose skin or gaining it all back too. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah you do have a point there. I'm just gonna keep on doing what I'm doing and I'll get to my goal one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work nights and its so quiet with no one around in a darker room. I wish at least one other person was here. <endOfText>
<human> I used to have the same problem, I'd always hear a bunch of spooky noises after everyone left. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. Some nights I get a bit too paranoid.  Especially near the machines I run.  Creepy. <endOfText>
<human> I worked night shift alone in an office and I'd always hear foot steps in the hallway  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend bought my movie ticket yesterday. It was a nice gesture by him <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice, what movie did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad the other night when my check engine soon light came on. It was just in the shop too <endOfText>
<human> Did you go to your mechanic for maintenance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today, in the subway, someone who wanted to get off at the very last minute, pushed me and made me fall. i was very angry. <endOfText>
<human> Did you report them to anyone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope i get next weekend off <endOfText>
<human> What do you have planned for next weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was throwing away some trash yesterday and I thought I saw an opossum run across my grass. <endOfText>
<human> Those things are gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get a feeling of being alone during the week. I wish I had a girlfriend <endOfText>
<human> That's understandable, companionship is great. Do you think you will seek one soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The rain made me feel down yesterday. I wanted to be out and about <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean! I got caught out in it by surprise, totally ruined my bike ride. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the Eagles can win the superbowl again this year, they are looking really good <endOfText>
<human> Did they win their preseason game?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did they win their preseason game? <endOfText>
<human> No but their quarterbacks did not really play, so it was expected <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So proud of my friend, he got a 95% on his test. <endOfText>
<human> Heck yeah that's awesome!  Did you celebrate with him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I'm losing my hearing almost entirely in my left ear and now in my right. No one knows what's going on. <endOfText>
<human> have you gone to the doctor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I finally have everything ready to apply to grad school. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats cool, what are you going to study <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other night <endOfText>
<human> Were you in a bad part of town? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone paid my car insurance for the year! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a stroke of luck! Who did you such a solid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i couldnt get out of work on time <endOfText>
<human> Nothing feels worse than losing time to work when you should be free. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new dog! <endOfText>
<human> What breed is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared about my upcoming job interview, I get really nervous about this type of thing <endOfText>
<human> What type of job are you applying for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter decided that she would make everyone dinner one night - and she's a bit creative. <endOfText>
<human> i bet that was very nice sounds like a nice family you have i bet you are so happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm constantly working and never get a break. Its been getting to me lately and I'm grumpy all the time. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was walking out of the kitchen yesterday and I spilled my bowl of cereal all over myself. <endOfText>
<human> Were able to save any of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my dog to the vet today. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully he is ok, did they find anything wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He has been really sick for a while now, but unfortunately he didn't get to come home with me today. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty scary, hopefully they can get him some meds and he gets to come home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter rides horses as a pasttime and was in her first dressage show a few weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's so exciting! How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm seeing my boyfriend for the first time in person for 1.5 years because he's been serving in the Army. I'm excited but have butterflies too and am nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow i didnt even know they go for that long. i hope all goes well for you all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, I just hope he still likes me because a lot can change and we haven't been in communication that often. <endOfText>
<human> well is he going back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  What happened?  Is your dog okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dog is missing <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  I assume you don't have a Chip implanted to track it? That's awful, I'd be furious! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A loud boom went off tonight. Scared me to death. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that would scare me too. What caused it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an outside cat that I let come in every so often just to enjoy her company while relaxing. Usually it's not an issue, but tonight she pooped on my floor! I <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Is she stressed about something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People say I sing really well. I used to be in talent shows at school <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Maybe you have natural talent for it and should try to become a singer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh no,what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I finally got everything together to apply to graduate school. <endOfText>
<human> how long is grad school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I volunteer at the animial shelter on weekends. <endOfText>
<human> Hey good for you!  Plenty of good boys and girls there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hate my printer <endOfText>
<human> Is it acting crazy or just not working? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That stupid thing is always acting up. <endOfText>
<human> You could name it Bob Marley since it's always "jammin" lol I couldn't resist <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very alone before I met my girlfriend and friend group <endOfText>
<human> How did you meet them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am pissed that someone put a dent in my car <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was so scared by the movie the Grudge, even to this day it still scares me today <endOfText>

<human> I would love to play with you sometime. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did my best but it wasn't enough to make the team. <endOfText>
<human> What team is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is so kind. <endOfText>
<human> What makes you say that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week, I robbed my neighbor appartment. She forgot to close her balcony door. I feel bad about it now after seeing her crying. <endOfText>
<human> did you give her stuff back <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am hoping to win the lottery this weekend <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran over a nail on the highway and I had to buy a whole new tire. <endOfText>
<human> That happened to me a couple months ago. It was a brand new tire which really sucked <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a birthday <endOfText>
<human> Well Happy Birthday!  Did you have a nice time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if you have kids, but my sister in law is a person that should have never had them. <endOfText>
<human> I do. Why do you say that about her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i  was scared to walk home last night <endOfText>
<human> Were you alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "When I was a preteen, my parents and my brother and I went on a Disney cruise. The first thing I remember about it was driving to the port from home and having a milkshake on the way.ort that was two hou This cruise was in the peak of the norovirus scare issues cruises had some 15 years ago. We got to the front of the ticket line and I puked all over the front of the counter. We were quarantined after that <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like it was a great trip and good memory to have, do you have a family of your own to take them on the same Disney cruise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for the weekend to get here <endOfText>
<human> Do you have some awesome plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been going through old photos and trying to figure out how to store them, but then I just spend half the time crying. <endOfText>
<human> brought back good memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just watched a show about stunt people in the movies. Its amazing what they can do! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it is, I always thought stunt doubles were cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very athletic and smart <endOfText>
<human> Don't worry about him.  Keep working on you.  I'm sure you have a lot of great qualities. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I make a great cheesecake. My friends and family always enjoy it. <endOfText>
<human> Ooh I love cheesecake! Is it your own recipe or one that was handed down to you or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I just looked for one online, but my own secret recipe is adding some orange zest. <endOfText>
<human> I will definitely have to try that next time I make cheesecake, thanks for the tip! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I hum songs from the 90s to myself, they were such earworms <endOfText>
<human> Older songs definitely have more texture and quality to them compared to the manufactured stuff we have that all sounds the same <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am finally good at where i am at work <endOfText>
<human> That's a good feeling I'm sure.  Stability means a lot these days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad had a stroke a few months ago.  It seemed like he'd pretty much recovered 100%. <endOfText>
<human> is he ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old shirt of my dad's in a box that I had stored for years.  It really brought back some good memories. <endOfText>
<human> Something dear and sentimental you should wear it sometimes on special occasions.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something dear and sentimental you should wear it sometimes on special occasions. <endOfText>
<human> I think I will.  It still has a slight scent of the Gray Flannel cologne he used to wear.  I miss him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i saw my gate open <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She came on to me but I had to tell her no. <endOfText>
<human> who <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't do anything all weekend <endOfText>
<human> Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing to do.  Just sat around at home playing video games. <endOfText>
<human> I love video games. Thats not a bad weekend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran into a group of people  I went to high school wiith over the weekend <endOfText>
<human> Hey cool!  Did you all catch up on old times? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found a dead squirrel in our basement. Something was stinking and it was that. I want to throw up because I have to clean it out. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, I guess you should get on that, hopefully you drew straws or something, but at least you found the source! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am pissed that someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> They didn't leave a note!?!?!?!?  That is the worst.  That is the kind of thing that makes you want to bring out forensics to take a paint sample and hunt the people down to bring them to justice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was disgusted when I saw someone get their skull cracked in a fight <endOfText>
<human> you saw that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i still think about when my daughter was a babu. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a good memory or bad one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for game of thrones to vome back <endOfText>
<human> when does it return? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for the weekend <endOfText>
<human> whats going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm totally missing my family today... can't believe it's been almost 6 months I moved away <endOfText>
<human> I live far away from my family so I understand completely. Why did you move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a bunch of video games and someone stole the box off my porch! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's awful, do you know who? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just lost my aunt. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has been taking care of his elderly mom, going to school and work full-time. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's amazing of him, it must be really hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend visited everyday while I was sick. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you were sick, but that's a good girlfriend taking care of you like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter needed a computer for school and we were trying to figure out which one to buy and how much we could spend. <endOfText>
<human> Did you guys figure it out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had 4 out of 5 lottery numbers right, but I didn't get any money for it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man!  That's sick!  So close!  That is torture.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man!  That's sick!  So close!  That is torture. <endOfText>
<human> I know, the excitement was building as every number came up, then.....so excited....NOTHING! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed the sale on wool socks. They are pretty pricey. <endOfText>
<human> Are those the 20 dollar socks why are they so expensive?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Are those the 20 dollar socks why are they so expensive? <endOfText>
<human> I have no idea. My feet get real cold, and I heard they're supposed to help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am super excited for the new super smash bros! <endOfText>
<human> Sweet. Will there be new characters? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has been a good dad for 2 decades. I'm sure his daughter will do well, when she goes off to college. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, that is rare these days unfortunately <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ordered pizza from a new place. Should be coming soon <endOfText>
<human> What style of pizza did you order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So jealous of my friend. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied to a scholarship over a year ago. I actually got news that I won it today. <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud of yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It looks like we are going to have to cancel our Labor Day plans. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting some dim sum this weekend. Hadn't had any for too long. <endOfText>
<human> I don't think I have ever had some, what is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty nervous about my doctors appointment on Thursday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Why are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately we had to have our cat put down earlier last week.  It was an upsetting experience <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that, that's such a hard decision to make.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sorry to hear that, that's such a hard decision to make. <endOfText>
<human> It was a rough couple of days that is for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know how my friend juggles a full-time job, a family and going to school. I can barely survive school and work. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe he doesn't sleep. Some people just have their lives together. Can't relate haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love summer, I get to eat so much ice cream <endOfText>
<human> Really? What is your favorite ice cream? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend farted in bed the other day, it was so bad I had to leave <endOfText>
<human> Lol I know you was bad he may need to watch what he eats or at least warn you next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager has decided to take me with him in a work trip to Washington. I was not expecting to be the one going. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited about it or not really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have big plans this weekend to go visit Orlando, Florida. <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. Are you going alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into my fridge cause I was starving and nothing! Not much good to eat so I sadly went back to the couch and cried. ha ha. <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up finding anything eventually or no? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love old disney movies <endOfText>
<human> Me too! They are the best!  Little Mermaid!  Beauty and the Beast!  What's your favorite if you can pick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made all A's in my classes last semester. I did not think I was capable of that. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, great job friend, that is no easy feat! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared about my upcoming job interview, I get really nervous about this type of thing <endOfText>
<human> You will be ok. Just prepare for it and it will go great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my sister in law should be arrested for what she did the other night. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds pretty serious. What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She went into my mother in laws room and stole her pain medication and then went driving <endOfText>
<human> Did your mother-in-law report her to the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the street the other day when I stepped in a steam pile of dog poo. I was so enraged. <endOfText>
<human> That's absolutely disgusting! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dented my dad's car when I was 18 and I still haven't told him the truth about it. <endOfText>
<human> What did you tell him that happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had 2 cups of ice cream today. <endOfText>
<human> Is that good or bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good to have occasionally. I love to have it. <endOfText>
<human> Good, enjoy it when you get it, that is what I say <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am appreciative of my family, they do a lot for me and help out a lot too <endOfText>
<human> That's what we called as family. Good that you've good family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate to say this, but I miss school. <endOfText>
<human> I think I can understand that.  It was a bit simpler than all this adulting we have to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter went on a missing trip to KY and worked with a lot of small kids.  She came home with lice. <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like an amazing person, but the lice is no bueno. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found a nice cooking channel on Youtube. I think its time I ascended from ramen <endOfText>
<human> While ramen is amazing, I agree, it might be time to try something new. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an ongoing bet going on with my friend that ends next week.  I am sure I am going to win,. <endOfText>
<human> What are you guys betting on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is funny to say, but it is a beard growing contest. <endOfText>
<human> hahaha so how long is it now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter graduated high school with a 4.0 GPA. <endOfText>
<human> Wow impressive! You must be very proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had a laptop put on hold at a store. Drove at least 1 hour for it, and it turns out the employee sold it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow I would be furious, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, I could not handle that at all <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. Are you with family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't go to dinner with my friends on time. So I ended up having dinner by myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I am sorry to hear that, maybe next time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, I could not handle that at all <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. How old was she when she passed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know how chefs push out food so fast. It takes me an hour to make a meal. <endOfText>
<human> lol maybe you need to practice more! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man this weekend is going to be SCARY <endOfText>
<human> Why? What's happening this weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my friend didn't get into the same job <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting an internship in my field of study in a couple of weeks! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, what is your field of study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just watched the movie I saw with my wife on our first date. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's sweet! What movie?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww that's sweet! What movie? <endOfText>
<human> While you were sleeping.  It is one of our favorites to this day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing important work and my laptop died, even though I had it plugged in. Lost some of the work. Ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when that happens!  I bet you were frustrated that all that work waas gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were late for the first day of school <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, that's not a good start. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a blind date this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am still shocked that Eli Manning didn't retire from football. <endOfText>
<human> Really? what else is he going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being young <endOfText>
<human> How old are you now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling bad about my son's activity. <endOfText>
<human> When children disappoint us, it can be particularly upsetting. What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's a 60 year old in one of my computer programming classes <endOfText>
<human> Oh well good for him! I don't see many older people actually making an effort to 'fool around' with technology, they all get too frustrated with it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im redoing my toddlers play room into more of a 'big boy' play room rather then a baby play room and Im really excited for him to see it. Hes going to be so happy. <endOfText>
<human> aww that sounds adorable! Is he getting to big boy age? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I eat a lot but don't get fat. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a fast metabolism then? I wish I had that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother's husband had alzheimers and went downhill really fast after the diagnosis. <endOfText>
<human> I"m so sorry to hear that. She must've been devastated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm asking my girlfriend to marry me this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> wow. congratualations. do you think she is expecting it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for school to start for me. <endOfText>
<human> Most people are dreading it. How come you're looking forward to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw this old lady's cart hit a car, and I didn't report her to the owner. <endOfText>
<human> What made you come to that decision, I get angry when people leave carts close to others cars.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What made you come to that decision, I get angry when people leave carts close to others cars. <endOfText>
<human> She was elderly, and the wind blew her cart. I just couldn't do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is already procrastinating in school <endOfText>
<human> That's not good. Procrastination can lead to a lot of stress. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just celebrated my 35th wedding anniversary and I have never been happier in my marriage! <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing!  So many people do not stay married these days, you should be proud of that accomplishment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I feel so bad about last weekend :/ <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my Grandpa 2 months ago. He died within a week all of a sudden and I miss him every day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that's terrible :(  I'm so sorry.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man that's terrible :(  I'm so sorry. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you.  Its been tough.  He brought our family together.  It was his time I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is finally getting married. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear! Will you be in the ceremony? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store and they were out of my favorite cereal. <endOfText>
<human> Ut oh.. what is your favorite?  I like so many I can't pick just one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad.. I had to leave my husband in the ICU and come home without him. <endOfText>
<human> Why is he in the ICU? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Year end appraisal is coming up. Am looking forward for a good hike <endOfText>
<human> What does that mean? A raise at work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im tired of being single <endOfText>
<human> you should hook up with somebody then!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family had to go to a funeral out of state this week.  I hate being alone. <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. You didn't go with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my interview for my new job tomorrow. Been practicing for it all week. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, how do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seinor year. I am graduating a 35 year old single mom <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on that. You truly did it. Age is just a number. I hope you have your whole life ahead of you yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an interview tomorrow for a job i had applied. I feel fully prepared for all the questions and I am confident I will do fine <endOfText>
<human> You will. Being prepared always helps <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Times are tough but with my family, life is good. <endOfText>
<human> That is true for some <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I get sad watching true crime shows <endOfText>
<human> I agree.  That happened to me and I had to stop watching them.  I worry too much about it happening to me or, even worse, my kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I see so many dudes hitting on my friend's girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Some men are such animals. Is she very attractive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped the stromboli. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that must have been difficult to clean up, what did you eat after that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The high school I went to is being torn down for a condo <endOfText>
<human> I bet that is kind of sad to see it go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is going great right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice to hear! What's going on in your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get my blood test results back tomorrow. I'm sure my results should be better than last year. <endOfText>
<human> i hope it will come better and it will!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have hit a dog while driving on the road. but i didn't stop it was so late in the night <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Accidents happen. I feel really sorry for the dog. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey you will not believe what Sara did last night. She left me at the bar all alone with a random stranger even though she knew I was intoxicated. <endOfText>
<human> Dang that Sara!  Did you tell her how unhappy you were with her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I have known her for years so I forgave her but I really expected a lot more from her. You know what I mean? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I understand.  Maybe you should pay her back somehow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hmm, yeah any suggestions on what I could do? I don't want to do anything too mean or that could put her in any danger though of course. <endOfText>
<human> Put sugar in her salt shaker next time you're at her house :D <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love that idea! <endOfText>
<human> LOL.  Good luck!  Glad you made it home safe :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dude.  I tried something really gross the other night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no...what did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ewww.  It was like..deep fried and stuff.  It was all mushy and gross. <endOfText>
<human> Hahaha, well to each their own, because I love how eggplant is mushy.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no...what did you do? <endOfText>
<human> EGGPLANT!!!  Have you ever had it?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. I LOVE EGGPLANT! How could  you find that really gross? <endOfText>
<human> Ewww.  It was like..deep fried and stuff.  It was all mushy and gross.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hahaha, well to each their own, because I love how eggplant is mushy. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad someone likes it.  :D <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math exam tomorrow. I've been studying for weeks! <endOfText>
<human> Are you confident you will pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was cleaning out and organizing my attic and found an old quilt from my grandma.  It made me feel kind of bittersweet. <endOfText>
<human> Everything happens for a reason <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been avoiding watching a scary movie for months <endOfText>
<human> I used to like watching scary movies. Not my thing anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died this time last year <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty bummed I didn't get to see my sister when she was in town. I don't get to see her often. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Why did you miss seeing her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm gone vegetarian for over a year now. I wonder how my blood results will be <endOfText>
<human> I bet they will be a lot better, I heard vegetarian helps a lot with that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just missed getting run over by a 18 wheel truck the other day. <endOfText>
<human> OH goodness!  I'm glad you are ok, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I just celebrated our 22nd wedding anniversary.  I cannot believe we've made it this far, so far. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  Marriages take work but it is totally worth it when you have a good partner.  Did you do anything special for the anniversary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone is aslee except for my son. He is really upsetting me <endOfText>
<human> Why is he not asleep?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why is he not asleep? <endOfText>
<human> He is a crazy toddler and doesnt care that everyones else has school. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got pulled over by the cops in front of my son's school. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was speeding.  I was so humiliated. <endOfText>
<human> In a school zone? thats not good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just fought my brother after hockey. <endOfText>
<human> oh why!! do you guys support separate teams!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad's cancer is getting worse day by day. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of cancer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so let down. I did not get any presents for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible, but I've been there myself.  It's hard to not be upset about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad and I were talking about the past, just reminiscing a bit. I'm going to miss these times. <endOfText>
<human> I miss my dad.. been so long.   What did you guys talk about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my math test the other day. I felt pretty rotten about it. <endOfText>
<human> What prompted you to do that?  Did you tell someone and clear your conscience? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat ran away and had been missing for over a week. <endOfText>
<human> oh that so sad!! Did you try searching him everywhere!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I look at my facebook memories every day <endOfText>
<human> How come? What year did you join? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm excited to start a new project at work <endOfText>
<human> Cool. Are you in charge? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sick and have a big meeting this week, not happy. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you don't feel well, is it a cold or something more serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait until next spring, I'm doing something that I've never done before. <endOfText>
<human> What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous.. my stomach is in knots. <endOfText>
<human> Legs weak arms are heavy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy. I start my new job this week <endOfText>
<human> That's great, what job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my new job. <endOfText>
<human> Are you a birthday clown? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cousin, who am seeing after a very long time grew up so tall.  I used to tease him a shorty <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel bad for teasing him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my new neighbors are the worst ones yet <endOfText>
<human> Did you get a chance to talk to them yet, and introduce yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends are in the process of adopting a child through DFACS.  It's been going on for so long though! <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome!  Are they adopting domestically or abroad?  My husband and I tried to adopt from Japan but our paperwork expired before we could and then I got pregnant. I hope it goes well for them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my friend that a guy didn't like her. I like him so I didn't want her to go after him. I feed bad though because he might have a thing for her. <endOfText>
<human> What do you think you are going to do, are you going to talk to him and find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am currently in the process of building a computer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, have you done this before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my husband. We have been married for 22 yrs. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's amazing!!!  You don't see that often these days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to check the mail the other day <endOfText>
<human> What was in there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to leave this apartment <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you are looking forward to it. What don't you like about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was so mad.  I came home and my back door was left open. <endOfText>
<human> Did anything get stolen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember having sleepovers with my friends as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh me. too.. Whats the craziest thing you remember happening? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling ill most of the month and discovered I am pregnant! <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its monday nigiht and my neighbors are having a freaking party <endOfText>
<human> Are you serious?  There's a noise ordinance for no loud noise or music after 10:00p.m.! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My work life makes me so stressed out due to work load. And I have no one to come home and receive emotional support from. Being lonely is the worst <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry you are going through this.  Maybe it would be a good thing to get a therapist so that you have someone that can help you through it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest daughter is graduating high school this spring. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on that. That is a great life milestone for her. Is she planning on getting into a college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a really bad headache and it ruined my whole day <endOfText>
<human> That sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have lent money to friend of my friend!! <endOfText>
<human> That was very generous of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know what grinds my gears? <endOfText>
<human> What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A printer that causes more trouble than it's worth!!! <endOfText>
<human> oh yeah that really do grind!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was cleaning my basement. I found lot of toys and books from my chidhood <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's awesome!  Did you take a day off and go through them for the memories??? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend told me she didn't like my chicken casserole recipe when I brought it to a potluck last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were you upset about it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor in my duplex is still up at this hour doing some kind of sanding and sawing! I asked him to stop and he won't! <endOfText>
<human> That is very disrespectful, especially since he is not in a stand-alone home.  Can you tell your landlord about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait until next summer, we have a big graduation trip planned for our daughter. <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting!  What torture waiting for a whole year!  Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some cake in my fridge the other day, it was a good day <endOfText>
<human> Cake always hits the spot when you have a sweet tooth. Was it from a birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a 6 piece nugget today and I got 7 nuggets! how awesome is that? <endOfText>
<human> Dang! That's like a 13 year old gets an extra mozz stick and ska plays in his head! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. I was so grossed out cleaning it up. <endOfText>
<human> Ewwwwwwwww! Was it a runny poop or a solid poop? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently moved to a new town, but it's kind of a bummer since I don't know anyone here yet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet! Did you move far away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! Why did you move so far? <endOfText>
<human> It was for my work! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled my coffee in the middle of a busy coffee shop. It was horrible! <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry. Did they give you another one for free? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole candy from the store when I was a kid. I still think of it to this day. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you feel like you needed to steal candy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally let a poot slip out during class today. <endOfText>
<human> LOL....Best thing to do when that happens is deny, deny, deny. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Smart move on your part. <endOfText>
<human> Bet she won't sit next to me again tomorrow lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving through my neighborhood when a car backed out of their driveway without looking. I was so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Did they hit you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter went on a mission trip to an area that is really depressed.  She brought something extra back home with her though. <endOfText>
<human> What did she bring back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe the content they post these days. <endOfText>
<human> On social media?  or on the TV? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole candy from the store when I was a kid. I still think of it to this day. <endOfText>
<human> I did that too!  I remember it was a package of Big League Chew.  My mom took me back to the store and made me talk to the manager.  Did you have to do that as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been going through some old photos that need to be organized, but it's slow going. <endOfText>
<human> Have you found any good ones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents threw me a surprise birthday today! I was shocked to see the mountain of presents upon walking through the door. <endOfText>
<human> WOW, how amazing!  I love surprise parties.  Did you get a lot of good stuff? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our little chihuahua had pancreatitis this past year and it was not a good outcome for her. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I am sorry to hear that. Is she still alive and well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I first found my cat... she was so tiny <endOfText>
<human> Did you nurse her back to health and get some weight on her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister has been dating this guy for about 7 years and I wish she would drop him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, it really sucks seeing someone you care about date someone who isn't good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Scrolling through old photos of me and my partner, i understand how much of a mistake I have made to let her go <endOfText>
<human> That's really rough man. Is there any way you can get her back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid broke my watch today...I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  How old is he/she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man. This weekend might be fun.  But it also might be SCARY <endOfText>
<human> Now why is it going to be scary? Going to a haunted house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> haha no!   Taking my neice and nephew to the amusement park! <endOfText>
<human> For what? Hallowscream at Busch Gardens?!?!? If so, that place is a blast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had planned a beach vacation this year, but it was not meant to be I guess. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I know that is so disappointing first hand.  The same thing has happened to me for the last three years.  Is everything going well, though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just had surgery last week. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it went well!! she is alright now right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It seems everyone in my family has a big house, except us. <endOfText>
<human> Eh, you'll get there eventually. Besides, big houses aren't even that great! All you need is a moderate amount of space to live comfortably. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My goldfish ran away yesterday. I am so distraught because I can't find the little tyke! <endOfText>
<human> Well, since he's supposed to be IN the water, you may have a fatality on your hands. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy to have 2 dogs and a cat <endOfText>
<human> I love animals too. What are their names? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away yesterday. I was so ticked off! <endOfText>
<human> Ah that's so terrible. Did you find him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got into accident <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Did he get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today we found out at work that they are closing the business down. This is horrible <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Do you have any other work lined up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been volunteering at the animal shelter as much as I can lately <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice. I've done that a few times and really enjoyed it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am expecting a time sensitive package, but the tracking for the package has been all wrong! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is the worst.  It really puts you on edge.  What will happen if it doesn't come on time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss said that I was rude to a customer earlier this year and that is why I am not getting a raise. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Have you tried to explain your side of things to your boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my dog is super spoiled.  I think she'd let us feed her with a spoon if we would comply. But the other day she did something I was shocked by. <endOfText>
<human> That is funny what did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park and read a book yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds relaxing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I missed my package delivery. I was home all day! Now I have to go pick it up at the post office <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, that's always the worst. I hope it wasn't something urgent you were waiting on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was coming home from work and there was a lizard by my door. It moved and that was all she wrote. I am scared to death of crawling creatures. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! I have the heebiejeebies just thinking about it! Did it attack you?!?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had all A's last year at school. <endOfText>
<human> Wow you must be so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a hair in my lunch.... let's just say my hunger went away quickly <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, that's quite disgusting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just saved a bunch of people on the beach this week. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I am glad to hear that you got to use your Baywatch-esque skills! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 10 pizzas all by myself last night. <endOfText>
<human> I don't know if that is a good thing or a bad thing, but either way it is EPIC. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had made a bad mistake on a work project, and my coworker took the blame for it. I felt bad for not speaking up to my boss. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. Did you make it up to your co-worker? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 10 pizzas last night. I never felt so bad about myself. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa! Did you have a strong craving or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the skating rink all by myself yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> All you must have been proud of yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered something yesterday and it was 3 day shipping... but I received it today. I'm so happy! <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty awesome, was it something you really wanted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my TV remote and i blamed it on my kid <endOfText>
<human> That's kinda terrible. Did you apologize to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, that's teribble <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe it when my wife told me she is pregnant with our first child! <endOfText>
<human> Dang! I bet that feeling felt incredible! Did you guys celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math exam tomorrow. Never felt so prepared in my life! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome.  Is this for college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know how much of a chore full-time employment is. What are you doing now? <endOfText>
<human> I am an officer in the United States Navy, but I agree with you. How about yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away yesterday. I've never been so distraught in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Awful. I'm so sorry. Have you tried putting up posters? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Walmart and someone pushed a shopping cart into my car. <endOfText>
<human> That was rude of them. Did you beat their face in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking at old childhood photos... good memories <endOfText>
<human> Ah yes!  How did it make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finished my final semester of college today! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Do you feel relieved to be done with school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until this weekend! I'm taking the whole family out for some fun! <endOfText>
<human> Great idea. Where are you planning on visiting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> Ooh, that's exciting. What did he say?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ooh, that's exciting. What did he say? <endOfText>
<human> He said "gruel"! He's going to be a regular Oliver Twist! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old senior yearbook the other day <endOfText>
<human> That must have been fun to go through and remember the good old days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw myself doing jumping jacks in the mirror with my shirt off, ugh. <endOfText>
<human> If you keep doing them you'll look better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i see a high end cars. I just envy them <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I wish I had a nice car too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My lawn mower was broken and my neighbor fixed it. <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of your neighbor. I wish i had one like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know! He said "alfredo"! How zany is that! <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy!  Most kids first words are "money". <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Panera Bread for dinner earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Pretty savvy place! Were you working on your 1000 page manuscript for 10 hours, squatting for free internet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling extra guilty about not sticking to my diet. I ate so much fried foods and a whole ice cream sundae by myself! <endOfText>
<human> I too feel your pain. I broke my diet by eating 4 dozen donuts in one sitting.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I too feel your pain. I broke my diet by eating 4 dozen donuts in one sitting. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I just feel so bad about it. I was trying to stay disciplined and good about my diet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the park and read a book today. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a nice and relaxing day. What book were you enjoying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 12 pizzas all by myself today. Never felt so bad about myself. <endOfText>
<human> Woah how did you manage to eat 12 pizzas <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out on date. It seems i forgot to use the body odour!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! A rookie mistake! Did your date notice the foul stench? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents threw me a surprise party today! <endOfText>
<human> woah really nice!! what and all they did <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really getting irritated with the traffic nowadays <endOfText>
<human> I know! It's terrible everywhere! And I'm the only one who knows how to drive because I created the automobile! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dangit!  They burned!! <endOfText>
<human> Are you baking? What did you burn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> YES!  LOL.  My brownies!!  All that time mixing and preparing wasted! <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty unfortunate. You should be like me and just buy them, always easier when someone else does the work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone blow their nose into their shirt. <endOfText>
<human> That's really gross. Did you say anything to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 20 Big Macs for dinner tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is really impressive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Only about 3 weeks to go! <endOfText>
<human> Three weeks to what?!?!?!?!?!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone lit a bag of poop on fire on my neighbors sidewalk last halloween.  The smell of it is something I won't soon forget. <endOfText>
<human> lol hey at least it was your neighbors sidewalk and not yours <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> Really? What was it, that must of been pretty wild. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my job interview today. I am quite hopeful that it is going to go well. <endOfText>
<human> I hope too !! I think you will do well!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is  off to her Mom's for couple of days <endOfText>
<human> Dang. Do you have the whole house to yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> That is funny. Dogs can be careless. You should take better care of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing Republicans clearly and directly rejecting notion of climate change makes me terrified of our future as a species <endOfText>
<human> It makes me feel the same. That's why I voted for myself in the last election. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Despite having overwhelming consensus among the climate scientists that human activity is causing it, they are still turning faces. Totally unacceptable for politicians <endOfText>
<human> Truly unacceptable. We would be better off with chimpanzees in office. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man drink an entire gallon of chocolate milk. <endOfText>
<human> That man is a winner if he kept it all down! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I am promised a promotion they give it to someone else.  It just happened again! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that keeps happening to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, your talents would be better suited elsewhere. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was an internet outage for hours today, the day I decide to stay home because I don't feel well. What a day. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty unlucky. At lease it wasn't a power outage though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stop thinking about my job interview tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> You must be really excited of the interview and i hope you will do well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting! What did he say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was unable to make my full rent this month. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that's rough. Are you set up for next month at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my wallet today. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of them. Where did they find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my key chain. My Late grandma present me for my 10th  birthday <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Did you manage to find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> oh no!!That's just terrible. did you made him to clean by himself!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe car prices will go down this year. And i am thinking of buying one <endOfText>
<human> Really? I'm thinking about buying one myself. What kind are you getting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my job interview tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, do you think you are prepared for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm disgusted whenever I go over to my sister's house. I feel like she hasn't cleaned it in months. <endOfText>
<human> That is indeed pretty gross. Perhaps you should help her clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died today. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, that's got to be tough on you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just able to pay off my parents house! <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow that's amazing!  That's awesome of you!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew started 10th grade this year! <endOfText>
<human> That is such a great age.  Is he doing well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm jealous of my neighbor's new pool, it looks like they are having a blast with it. <endOfText>
<human> Hmmm. Have you asked to go over for a dip? He never said you couldn't come over and partake in the fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Ruh Roh! Did it come out of the rug easily? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son stole a car from an elderly man today. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's awful. Why did he do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a fly in my room and it is annoying the heck out of me! <endOfText>
<human> You should get some bug spray. Fly's are nasty <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy france won the world cup. I was just so happy that England didn't. <endOfText>
<human> Same, my friend! France played so well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The cafe down the street used to be my favorite place to eat. <endOfText>
<human> Used to be? What happened to it? Did it get closed down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just can't stand it anymore. My partner nags almost about every detail of our relationship. Just yesterday, she criticized my taste for clothing <endOfText>
<human> That would get very irritating. Have you talked to her about it and let her know how you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend moved away to another city. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, you are going to miss him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting married next year <endOfText>
<human> I am so happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought a battery pack charger for my car, and guess what happened to me today. <endOfText>
<human> I have no idea. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend always tells me what to do. <endOfText>
<human> Does it bother you when she does that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling pretty bummed after seeing a photo of myself 4 years ago, I gained so much weight! <endOfText>
<human> Only you can change that, my friend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My tooth is shaking and i think it will fall off <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Have you gone to a dentist to get it checked out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my job interview tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My iguana ran away today. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good, I don't think iguana's can live out in the wild. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a huge raise at work. <endOfText>
<human> That must be great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot what I was saying during my speech at work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is embarrassing.  Were you able to recover by the end? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let out a moist, warm fart today in front of all of my co-workers today. <endOfText>
<human> You must be very comfortable in your office! How did they react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new semester starts next week and I think it will be my best one yet. <endOfText>
<human> Aw yeah! What year are you in college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hope my dog feels better, she has been sick this past week. <endOfText>
<human> Aw I hate to hear that. I also hope she feels better. I love my dog so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! Which word did he choose? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They opened up this really cool toy store about a block from my house. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty neat. Did you buy anything cool? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got some scented gel pens and a few of those pens where you can change to different ink colors. Also, a few books for my nephew! <endOfText>
<human> That's so cool! Sounds like a store you would find in Daiagon Alley! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking in the park when a stray dog chased after me. <endOfText>
<human> That's scary! Did you chase it away and show it who's boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stubbed my toe in the shower this morning...it felt like my world was coming to an abrupt end. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate when that happens! Does it still hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family forgot about me and left me behind at the house this weekend. It felt so weird to be all by myself in the house. <endOfText>
<human> I imagine that must have been quite a lonely experience for you. Did you see any ghosts? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I love my wife <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, I bet she loves you just as much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm disappointed in how my brownies turned out. They are so mushy! <endOfText>
<human> Ewwww.  Maybe you should put them back in the oven for a bigt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> haha!  Did you just eat a bunch of mushy brownies? <endOfText>
<human> I'm guilty as charged! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not really sure if I am going to be able to find a gift for my wife's birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Why not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, that's awful. Maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later. <endOfText>
<human> I may have to push it till Christmas. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man eat an entire tube of toothpaste. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's quite a feat. Did he get sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just got her dream job basically. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great! What job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting anxious thinking about moving in 2 weeks, I hope I like the city I'm moving to! <endOfText>
<human> That would be nerve racking, but also fun I think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my lawn gnome today. <endOfText>
<human> How nice of you to loan it out! Have to admit, never heard of someone "borrowing" a lawn ornament though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man.  The other night I did something GROSS <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate some nasty mushy eggplant for dinner!!! <endOfText>
<human> Ew, that does sound gross.  Was it some sort of bet or that's all you had? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just gave me my favorite watch for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, how much was it worth? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a sip of milk at work and it was sour. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yuck. Maybe it was expired then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to go to the cinema this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> Oh what movie do you want to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when fast food used to be really cheap. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, and you didn't have to always buy items for the extra value menu. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to win a gift card in the work raffle ticket contest, and I lost by one number! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that was so close. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the new apartment I moved into, but the only down side is I can hear traffic all night long. It's so annoying! <endOfText>
<human> I remember my first city apartment, the lights and sirens. It can be difficult. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A woman passed gas right in front of me at the mall. <endOfText>
<human> Jeez. Was it audible? Smellable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last piece of cake at the office party at work and didn't tell anyone. <endOfText>
<human> I would do that to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone took my phone when I was at work. <endOfText>
<human> From your house? do you have any idea who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate all the brownies I made. Let's just say I'm not too proud of my self control. <endOfText>
<human> They must have been quite good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, they were delicious, I'm ashamed I couldn't control myself! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you have better control next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a flat tire over the weekend, and the AAA guy changed that tire so quickly and professionally. It was very impressive! <endOfText>
<human> Lucky! Last flat I had was on a gravel road in the middle of nowhere,lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have just started taking care of my grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> That's very admirable of you. It feels like no one takes care of family anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She has dementia and I am the last of her family.  I hate seeing her languish in the nursing home she is in.  Hopefully I can get her doing better. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure with your care, she will be much better off. I wish you and your family well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my doggie to the vet <endOfText>
<human> Oh no is your dog okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to bake a chocolate cake tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's sweet!  What for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's for a pot luck dinner.  I am ready for the challenge. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh yeah!  That sounds awesome!  Is it a contest? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After visiting gym regularly for the past month, i have lost 4 pounds. I am very satisfied with my results <endOfText>
<human> I am very proud of you!  Keep it up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to build a motor tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Is it for your work or part of any school projects you are having? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just recently witnessed this guy dump a pile of garbage from his truck on the freeway. <endOfText>
<human> garbage collection most important <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling pretty guilty, I used my wife's razor's to shave this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Would she mind that? I wouldn't really mind that so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite donut shop went out of business. <endOfText>
<human> Ah that's a pity. It really sucks to lose favorite shops. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will watch a film this weekend and I have my fingers crossed it isn't a stinker. <endOfText>
<human> What movie is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked out the door this morning and saw a six-car pile up! <endOfText>
<human> What a way to wake up! That's awful, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know what really grinds my gears?! <endOfText>
<human> You uttering this phrase, i remembered the Peter Griffin Meme. So tell me, what grinds your gears? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That one luggage bag that my passed uncle gave me as a present when i was about to start my college life away from home, i discarded it today as it became very old. It was the only reminder of him <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Why didn't you keep it in the attic or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trusted my wife with taking my truck to visit her parents this week. I hope she takes care of it! <endOfText>
<human> Is she a good driver? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to my new job. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, is in an area that you are interested in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't even explain how much I care for this cat I have, it's like my best friend! <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry. what happened to the cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So... I am tired of getting cold french fries every time i go to this fast food restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, I'm with you.  That's the worst, it almost ruins the meal. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> From starting i told about my love to my family.they are not accepted after that handled more problems.finally we got both family permission. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy to see her. <endOfText>
<human> ok carry on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a fast food drive thru and the cashier refused to give me my correct change or the receipt. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me angry, and it is impossible to deal with in a drive thru. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm embarrassed that I left my car lights on all day at work. I had to get it jumped from my boss. <endOfText>
<human> Good thing your boss was available. I would not worry about being embarrassed. We've all done something dumb. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I got through shopping there was a scrape on my car door where someone had banged their door into it. They didn't leave a note and I was enraged. <endOfText>
<human> I would be pretty furious as well, those can be expensive to get removed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took 100 dollars from my bosses wallet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear. Did they find out about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just KNOW I got an amazing grade on my last test... Can't wait to see it. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a great feeling! Congratulations on all the hard work you put in paying off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened our bathroom door and to my surprise there was a snake laying across the floor! <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! that's scary, what did you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's new pet kitten tragically got hit by a car this past weekend. I felt so bad for her. <endOfText>
<human> That is so terrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to assemble a dresser from IKEA. <endOfText>
<human> That's gonna take some time. I love their designs, but I hate the assembly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my favorite vase. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What had happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy to see that my little nephew made me a birthday gift! <endOfText>
<human> Oh what did he make you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our toilet got clogged and we had to call a plumber to come fix it. It was actually my fault. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, a plunger didn't do the trick? Hope it wasn't too expensive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad, tomorrow will be the last time I get to see my friend before she leaves for college! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is sad. I hope you can spend some good time together then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thankful that I am diligently following my saving habit. I feel in control over my urges for unnecessary spending <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I saved up for 4 months but then had a massive car repair bill.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I park my car in my apartment's parking lot, someone parks way too close to me. It's annoying! <endOfText>
<human> That's so frustrating! Do you know who it is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in a new city and don't know what to do. <endOfText>
<human> That could be kind of scary. Have you tried to meet anyone that might could show you around and then maybe you would not be so lonely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend tried to get me to drink and drive but I didn't. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! It is really dangerous to do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-worker makes almost double the amount I do and yet does about half the work... <endOfText>
<human> That is so messed up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The Olympics skaters are really good atheletes, I'm impressed <endOfText>
<human> Yes I agree. I love to watch them do their routines on TV. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I looked out my window this morning and saw a skunk staring right back at me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How big was it? Did you smell it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped a mug and my coffee went everywhere <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! That made a mess I bet. Did you get burned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was jogging a couple days ago and suddenly a bear came out of the woods! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! That sounds terrifying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the winter. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I'm excited for fall, I like to layer my clothes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very happy with my baking skills, people tell me I make really good cookies <endOfText>
<human> I would love to try them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend can sing really well but I can't <endOfText>
<human> Don't be so hard on yourself. Some people are just naturals! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to do well in my next exams, I want to get my certification <endOfText>
<human> You should put some time aside to study. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never thought that I would be noticed. <endOfText>
<human> By who? Who are you trying to get noticed by? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wife so much. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice to hear! Have you treated her to something special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I noticed that I had toilet paper on the bottom of my shoe at work. No one told me! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been very humiliating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I split my pants while bending over at work. <endOfText>
<human> oooh, sorry, that must have been embarrassing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I felt so humiliated. <endOfText>
<human> take it easy, did you find your way out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite pizza place closed down late last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was it a small local place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I tripped over nothing and landed on my face <endOfText>
<human> Ouch. I actually have done that before too though...  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ouch. I actually have done that before too though... <endOfText>
<human> I'm so clumsy, my balance is just terrible sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have a camping site booked and I got everything packed up. My family won't get out of bed so we can get going. I hate waiting. <endOfText>
<human> jeez that sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah, I spend half my life waiting for my family. <endOfText>
<human> what time is the trip <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when my grandpa died i was so sad, i did not know if i could move on <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is just awful. Losing someone is so hard.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that is just awful. Losing someone is so hard. <endOfText>
<human> i could not believe it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving in a sketchy part of town to drop a computer off to a friend, and I did not feel safe at all <endOfText>
<human> That sounds scary. What made you feel unsafe? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The traffic was so bad this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that sounds frustrating! I get road rage! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visited an old friend the other day who lives about an hour away from me in another town, and her 10 year son has this new puppy they got. He was showing me all things he had taught this puppy to do in the last week of having him. The dog could already shake, lay down, sit, roll over, run in a circle, jump, and sit still when a treat was put on his nose until you tell him okay. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is impressive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know! The puppy is a 12 week old Schnauzer, I guess they are super smart! <endOfText>
<human> I wish your friend could teach my dog a few tricks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had a little bit of a hospital stay to have routine surgery. A co-worker came to visit me while I was there, which surprised me. Kinda nice to see something unexpected like that, for people to show they care. <endOfText>
<human> It's good to hear! Are you alright now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I expected a hike in my package. <endOfText>
<human> A hike in your package? I'm sorry, I don't follow. As in how long it would take to get there to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I saw a guy leave the bathroom without washing his hands. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like it would be pretty gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went thru my childrens old clothes the other day and its hard to believe they are grown up now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I understand, mine is only 2 1/2 right now but I feel that way too when going through his preemie clothes. You probably feel it much more if they are grown though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think we probably feel it about the same! It was a nice memory to come across tho. <endOfText>
<human> Yes! Do you keep your favorite things of theirs? I always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through some boxes in my moms storage unit looking for something the other day and came across a bunch of my great great grandmas momento boxes. We looked inside them and found some super weird stuff, like a ponytail full of my grandmas grandmas hair! I was so weirded out! <endOfText>
<human> What a beautiful memory tho to have! Yeah a little weird but a little cool too!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What a beautiful memory tho to have! Yeah a little weird but a little cool too! <endOfText>
<human> I suppose, it was in a plastic bag, and we were so surprised to see that it was the same color as my hair and my moms. I just felt kinda nervous around stuff that dead relatives had, like their hair.. lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed to pass in my exam. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What kind of exam was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sent off a difficult email today and a bit worried about the response. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, don't worry. You'll get good response. What was the email about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sad that my partner is not making as much progress as he should be. <endOfText>
<human> In his work? or life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Moving my grandmother to an assisted living facility from her independent life has been such a transition for the whole family. Seniors can be stubborn and its been stressful to help her feel at home there and not hate it. Yesterday after visiting her however, she actually is looking more happy to be there finally. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good to hear. Being independent  all your life and then being cared for all the time can be a hard transition <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, before that all the time we spent with her was filled with caring for her basic needs instead of doing enjoyable leisure activities with her. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully this will work out well for everyone involved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was running late for work because I woke up late. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hate when that happens. Did you make it on time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For my 21st birthday my friends threw me a surprise party. Friends that I hadn't seen in years showed up, it was great. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so fun. What great friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have tried long and hard to lose a few pounds and i finally did, now i can wear that shirt that i use to wear and it fits me now. yayy <endOfText>
<human> Losing weight is the best feeling. I did that a couple of summers ago.. It's one of those few things where you can visibly see yourself getting better, and there's not much that gives you as much pride as that. Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents didn't save enough for retirement, and now that they're retirement age, they're struggling a little. I'm still in college and am not able to really help them. I'm worried about how they'll survive financially, and I feel guilty about not being able to offer much. <endOfText>
<human> There is always social security and part time jobs, that seems to be the norm these days. A lot of old people do not have enough saved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to a fast food place, and they messed up my order. I even repeated it twice, and had them double-check with me again after that! I know they're under a lot of pressure and work hard, but why is order accuracy so hard... <endOfText>
<human> What place did you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very alone, that was not a fun time <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear your life took a turn. It's always weird, and even sometimes funny, to look back on your life to see where you came from, and how different and sometimes worse things were <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won $100 on a scratch off today. I was shocked. I never win. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How often do you play the lottery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super sad this past weekend without my significant other. <endOfText>
<human> Did they go away or did you break up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is sick so I am taking him some soup. <endOfText>
<human> Good mom, or dad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is a rough day, I am alone a lot lately. <endOfText>
<human> Ah I'm sorry to hear that. Were you really busy today then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The mosquitos where I live seemed to be getting really bad! When sitting by the fire at night we get so eaten up even with bug spray and candles! So for this last time we did a fire I bought these two blue lantern things that attract the mosquitoes and zap them to death! Let me tell you, those mosquitoes didn't stand a chance, and no bug spray needed! <endOfText>
<human> Those sound super effective. I wish I had some of them here,  I have never seen mosquitoes as bad as they are this year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor threw their nasty trash all over their yard and won't clean it up! It's sooo gross! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's disgusting! Have you tried to talk to them about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon <endOfText>
<human> Ive wanted to play the switch for so long long, I have heard such good things about it.  do you like it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked hard the entire smesetr only yo fail again! <endOfText>
<human> What did you fail at exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I got a new haircut the other day after not cutting it for years. It feels so good to have some type of change, and I feel so good about myself just from such a small change! <endOfText>
<human> How long did you let your hair get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get emotional about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> I understand, I have a brother as well. Do they live with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other night I was walking alone and a guy kept following me. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you had something to protect you? Like  a whistle or pepper spray?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you had something to protect you? Like  a whistle or pepper spray? <endOfText>
<human> I did not that night. You just can't let men or anyone get close to you at night...It's too much of a risk. I turned to go in another direction and he still followed. I ended up getting OFF the walkway and walking quickly so I could lose him. I have a small pepper spray now but I had forgotten it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting started on my work week. I didn't go out much this past weekend and instead worked in my garden. It was very tranquil. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very relaxing, what do you grow? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> How many people are you expecting? I hope he pulls through. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just received a job offer but I am not sure if I should take it or not. <endOfText>
<human> Is it a new field? How's the pay and benifits? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my best friend's sister out on a date secretly. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you tell your best friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad that I lost my wallet last night. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry.  I hope you find it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really not looking forward to having to pay student loans once I graduate. Why does it cost so much to get an education? How do young people survive right out of college when they get slammed with all of this debt? It seems kind of rigged <endOfText>
<human> I have no idea. As someone with loans myself, it makes me so angry thinking about how much money I've been robbed. I wasn't thinking at 18 years old, I didn't understand the amount. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is soon, it's always a wonderful time to reflect. It's a great time of year for me! <endOfText>
<human> Well hey, happy early birthday. I'm happy you take a positive spin on it.. I wish I could do that myself. I hate mine, always dread when it comes. Makes me feel like I haven't achieved what I would have liked to have achieved at the age I'm turning to, so I just get self-conscious about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling positive about this week. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad!  Anything good happening? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is having a baby, I'm shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! Why are you so surprised? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in the middle of breaking down some pork shoulder. I have to slow cook for an eternity haha, it's going to be so tasty. <endOfText>
<human> I love pork shoulder. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an old truck that I enjoy working on and driving around. <endOfText>
<human> What great fun! My husband had a 1960 Ford F150 he completely redid. It was quite an attraction around town! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My class is finally over and now I just wait for my grade to be posted. <endOfText>
<human> How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss taking road trips with my friends <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you could take one soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate's friend comes over and just eats all of the food in our fridge without really asking. I don't get how people can have a total lack of self-awareness and can be so selfish to just barge in and eat other people's food. I cringe at thinking about being that rude to someone <endOfText>
<human> I would be mad as heck. Did you confront them about this behavior? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get emotional about my brothers, they are very important to me <endOfText>
<human> Is there a reason you get so emotional besides them being improtant to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate seeing my friends take fancy vacations all the time. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that, it is not fun to not make money the way others do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling so horrible lately and I went to the doctor. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Any news back yet on what it could be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live out in the middle of nowhere and after not hearing them at all this summer, I heard a pack of coyotes the other night. <endOfText>
<human> That would be really scary! What do you do if they get close to your home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister insisted on popping a pimple on my back. I really didn't want her to do it. <endOfText>
<human> lol I don't blame you. Did you end up letting her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping the new super smash bros will be excellent, it looks the part so far! <endOfText>
<human> When does it come out? Sounds cool! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend is starting to get on my nerves. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He is always talking to other girls. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well if he is flirting, I would dump him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This has been a long year. <endOfText>
<human> What has made it such a long  year for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked my kids all the way to school and then realized I had forgotten her backpack <endOfText>
<human> What did you do after you realized that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never lied to my wife. <endOfText>
<human> thats great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling so concerned this morning. I lent my brother my car and he's a horrible driver. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I hope it turns out ookay for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I met my girlfriend and friends I was very alone, that was not a fun time <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I bet it wasn't! You must have felt terribly lonely! I'm glad you found some new friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad at my job recently, they are overworking us a lot <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Are you working more hours or are they cramming it into the hours you already have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took a long time to do it due to a lot of hardships in life, but my wife finally graduated from a masters program over the Summer. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, wat is her degree in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping the new super smash bros will be as good as it looks <endOfText>
<human> What system do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my ex boyfriend keeps trying to get back together with me <endOfText>
<human> Why did you break up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm tired of this hot weather. I'm ready for Fall. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! I love fall weather!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too! I love fall weather! <endOfText>
<human> What do you think is your favorite part of Fall ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today would've been my little sister's 3rd birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Would've been ? I'm very sorry for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone went back to college, I'll need to find new people to hang out with but I don't have the energy. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should see about signing up to some sort of social group? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got the rest of the day off and I'm just going to sit in the couch and relax. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a plan for a day off, I'd love to do that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't put my blinker on and got a ticket for it. <endOfText>
<human> aww man. Thats a silly reason to get pulled over. Did you try to talk to the police officer about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am excited for the new super smash bros game coming out for the switch soon <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, that game looks crazy. They have a ridiculous amount of characters this time, it's great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I waited and waited but I finally got my security deposit back from my old apartment. Took my landlord long enough! <endOfText>
<human> It's amazing..the rich just think we don't have bills and needs right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling nervous about leaving for my trip. I am supposed to go for three months. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting and a little scary. Where are you going?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going all over western Europe. Its a little daunting to think about. <endOfText>
<human> I took a trip to europe once.  Once you get used to riding the rails and traveling around it's a blast. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds exciting and a little scary. Where are you going? <endOfText>
<human> I am going all over western Europe. Its a little daunting to think about.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss gave me the afternoon off. <endOfText>
<human> Those days are they best. Are you going to run errands or just chill? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I've been through that too.  Were you really close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had some limbs fall recently from storms and I've had to work hard to clean it all up. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it didn't damage your house or anything on your property! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner/semi partner (lol) wants to come over next weekend..but I am not feeling comfortable with it. <endOfText>
<human> What makes you uncomfortable about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew he would come through though. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of stuff? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a guy riding on the side of the road to the store in his scooter/wheelchair. <endOfText>
<human> Man that has to be a rough go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man keeps asking me out on a date, not understanding that I would never cheat on my husband. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh! What a dunce! Maybe your husband should tell him. Have you told him strongly? Like..stay away from me creep? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! I've been pacing around all day waiting to hear from the vet. My cats are getting checked out right now. <endOfText>
<human> Are your cats ok or are they sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was washing my car in my front yard the other day, and my 2 1/2 year old gets a hold of the hose and starts running from me. There are several people outside doing whatever theyre dong that see this. Everytime I got within 2 feet of my kid he would spray me in the face with the hose and keep running. This just went on and on while everyone watched probably laughing at me. <endOfText>
<human> Haha oh boy toddlers, they can be a real handful! My daughter is almost 2 so I understand! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been watching a lot of prison shows. It really sad <endOfText>
<human> Why is it sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the 90s! The best music, snacks, and tv shows! <endOfText>
<human> I know right! What shows did you watch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a man eat 3 pounds of canned tuna. <endOfText>
<human> Eww. I hope he was outside - that stuff stinks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother recently got accepted to teach at an ivy league college. <endOfText>
<human> Which ivy league college? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was once walking through a forest <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really pleasant. What kind of forest was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some man was talking to my girlfriend at the carnival. <endOfText>
<human> Did they do anything like kissing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have two beautiful daughters. <endOfText>
<human> That's incredible. How old? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my friend about something, I'm too ashamed to even say what. <endOfText>
<human> Okay, will it damage anything ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors had a really loud fight the other night at 2am. <endOfText>
<human> Have they gotten in fights like that before, and did the police get called? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took out the trash last night and the can tipped over ontop of me <endOfText>
<human> Aaah, gross! I bet it smelled awful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to the dentist's office tomorrow and I'm dreading it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, do you have a anxiety pill you could take to calm you down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband left me, I have no one. <endOfText>
<human> How terrible! I'm so sorry that happened. How long ago was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to visit my grandmother since she had been very sick and bed ridden for a couple weeks.  When I got there, I saw her get up and out of bed! <endOfText>
<human> Whoa. She must be feeling a lot better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cars auto locks went out on me. It is such a pain having to manually check them all the times. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is such an inconvenience.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! That is such an inconvenience. <endOfText>
<human> It is. It doesnt seem cheap to fix either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know that I will make the NHL next season. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you sound really confident of that! I hope you have a backup plan in case you don't, but you must be really good at hockey. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My last school semester went pretty rough. I'm really wanting this one to go better; I'm planning to put more effort into studying this time. <endOfText>
<human> That is good that you want to study more. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty sad when I when I didn't get invited to the person's event. Mostly because we knew a lot of the same people. <endOfText>
<human> did you say something or show up anyway? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> Neat! What kind of pet does your sister have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so excited that school starts tomorrow. I need a break! <endOfText>
<human> I know right. Mine started yesterday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They want you to remember their last summer vacation day with you. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I definitely won't forget! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally stepped in dog poop the other day, ugh. <endOfText>
<human> So gross! I've been there. Hopefully not new shoes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling positive about the newborn we have here and that he will make it! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I'm sure everything will be fine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to go see a cover band of my favorite band soon. <endOfText>
<human> Oh what is the band? Sometimes cover bands sound better! lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm tired of being harassed by this corrupt city. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes governments can be detrimental rather than helpful. What is the harassment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i think my son is addicted to screens and he is three <endOfText>
<human> That's not good! Take them away, start early <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have had extra money to save up the past few weeks! <endOfText>
<human> Are you svaing for something particular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had no prior experience going ice climbing! This was very strenuous and particular. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine it was! Wow. Did you enjoy yourself tho?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can imagine it was! Wow. Did you enjoy yourself tho? <endOfText>
<human> It was enjoyable! We saw incredible views of the glacier! I wish I had a go-pro filming the experience though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a terrible experience when I was out the other day with my daughter.. people can be so rude. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Sometimes people are just having bad days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These 2 women were standing behind us just laughing, and everytime I would look behind me they would do the thing like " oh shhh " and cover their face and laugh. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I see. Were they making fun of you guys? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy when i got the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> Do you normally have to work on weekends? What did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you normally have to work on weekends? What did you do? <endOfText>
<human> yea i do, i wanted to go fly fishing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My state sent me a tax bill for my newly opened business for $7,000!!! <endOfText>
<human> Gaah! That's a state tax bill? That's insane, it's hard enough already to open a business. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't even made $100 yet..and I have not used my tax exempt status...So that was shocking! I swear..everytime I open the mail..it's anxiety city! I called and they said it was just an estimate to make me file my taxes :/ I'm like...I didn't even make anything last year..My partner did- I was pregnant and sick! I was also on medicaid so how did I make 100,000?? lol! Ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> Jesus! I hate opening my mail already because it's bills, I can't imagine trying to do something that ambitious which in of itself is a lot of work to get a business started and you have to learn so many different things, and then on top of it being sent stuff like that. Agghh! I hope it ends well for you, though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm thinking I might have to find a different line of work. I'm a truck driver, and have been for a long time, but it's really difficult to do long trips now that I'm married. <endOfText>
<human> I can't imagine! I have a hard time sitting for long hours too. What are you looking in too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi I went to a skating park. <endOfText>
<human> Never heard of such a thing. Is it outdoors? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The garbage men had trash strewn all over and they just left it- It fell out apparently when they were throwing trash in the truck. <endOfText>
<human> Did they pick it back up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a old tool box with my grandfather's tools in it in the garage. <endOfText>
<human> oh that is cool, did it bring back some memories as well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Are there any cameras in the parking lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw my gate left open <endOfText>
<human> Oh? Did someone leave it open, or did someone break in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend can juggle 4 knives at once! <endOfText>
<human> how many fingers have they lost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so mad at my neighbor! He blasts his tv outside on his patio all night long. <endOfText>
<human> call the po-po. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home last week <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a turtle in my yard one day just panting and hot and all dried out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh poor thing!  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I can get everything I need to get accomplished before the end of summer. <endOfText>
<human> What all do you have to get done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally went on my first rollercoaster since I've never been to an amusement park. What's the deal with rollercoasters?! How is that fun, that's not fun, that's scary! <endOfText>
<human> It is scary yet exhilarating lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so surprised when I found I was pregnant <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, congratulations! I'm guessing you weren't expecting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stripped in front of the cute barista at the coffee shop. I dont think I can return. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah why is that? Did the cops drag you out?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whoops!!! I mean I tripped. What an inconvenient typo!!! I must be so frazzled. <endOfText>
<human> hahah stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped! I gotcha  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah why is that? Did the cops drag you out? <endOfText>
<human> Whoops!!! I mean I tripped. What an inconvenient typo!!! I must be so frazzled.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hahah stripped sounded so much better but okay tripped! I gotcha <endOfText>
<human> Im not that crazy but I do feel kind of dumb. I tripped over my shoestring and spilled coffee everywhere. What a moron.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby can hold her own forks now and feed herself. :o So proud of her and happy for me. lol <endOfText>
<human> Thats a big accomplishment.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats a big accomplishment. <endOfText>
<human> it really is! :) im one happy mama thats for sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to get the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> Weekends off are always great.  What did you do with your time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent 5 hours baking a cake yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That's a lot of dedication. Was it for a special occasion? And have you been baking for very long, or do you do it professionally at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm at a good weight and I'm fairly healthy, but I'm visiting my girlfriend right now and I always over-eat and eat desserts that I shouldn't when I'm around her. Makes me feel like an overweight slob <endOfText>
<human> As long as otherdays you are eating healthy I think its fine to cheat once in awhile <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday at work during lunch I noticed my shirt was inside out. <endOfText>
<human> Who hasn't that happened to before! If it took you that long to notice, I bet no one else noticed. Were you able to fix it later? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im waiting on a nice sized check to come and cant wait to go spend it! <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! what are you planning to spend it on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every Sunday I goto church. <endOfText>
<human> that's wonderful! I go to church every sabbath <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking to my pastor the other day and i got all emotional and i cursed! I was so embarrased <endOfText>
<human> I am sure he has heard it before! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger <endOfText>
<human> A three pound burger?!? That's crazy, I could never eat one of those in one sitting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really starting to miss my friends and family. I have been traveling for a few months now. <endOfText>
<human> Did you travel for work or for vacation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on date tonight after work. I think its going to go well. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. You sound confident. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for you. Good luck. Just remember to have a good time and you will be fine. <endOfText>
<human> That's the plan! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super upset that my yard received a ticket for being too long yet all the abandoned houses around me have 5ft tall grass. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Do you mow a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got into graduate school <endOfText>
<human> And how does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not sure about going to this new mechanic. I have good and bad things <endOfText>
<human> well what are some things that are bad from him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very sad when my company had left me alone the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Your company left you alone? In what way? That does sound like a troubling situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> First time I went to my very first Dungeons and Dragons get-together, I felt really overwhelmed with all the verbiage and rules and stuff like that. Had no idea what I was doing and felt dumb. Did my best to learn what I could this time around, and I plan to not drag everyone else down <endOfText>
<human> What is your character? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet the other day <endOfText>
<human> awh that does sweet of you, what kind of pet is it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> awh that does sweet of you, what kind of pet is it? <endOfText>
<human> its a bearded dragon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my keys in the store and it took me 2 hours to find them! I was a mess. <endOfText>
<human> where were they <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone found them and turned them into customer service luckily. <endOfText>
<human> oh that was nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so isolated. I just moved to a new city where I don't know anyone. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel I can be lonely sometimes.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know how you feel I can be lonely sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> It really is! I don't have any family or friends around. I miss them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got some crushing news. I just got a call to tell me I did not get the job I really wanted. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I'm so sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<human> Yea it was a really great opportunity too. It will be hard to find something similar. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was insanely upset when our CAR got a ticket for being on my OWN lawn. <endOfText>
<human> did you get it dismissed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when my dog got out <endOfText>
<human> Maybe he was upset with you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll be getting a promotion in Feb. I didn't expect it. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa what a great surprise. Congratulations. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been traveling for three months now. I am really starting to miss my family and friends. <endOfText>
<human> Long trip. How can you afford it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something terrible just happened to me! <endOfText>
<human> Are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to wear my grandfathers watch that I inherited for luck. I can still picture him wearing it. <endOfText>
<human> Does it work for good luck? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate some homemade ice cream the other day. What a wonderful treat. <endOfText>
<human> did you make it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happay when i got approved for the day off <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. Always nice to take some time for the self, especially with PTO. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a big web in my bathroom window one day. I generally don't like spiders but I don't like to harm anything (unless its mosquitos or fleas). <endOfText>
<human> Yikes. Did you ever find the spider? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I will get my debt paid off sooner than I originally planned! <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome! What a huge relief that must be.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's so awesome! What a huge relief that must be. <endOfText>
<human> It's a huge relief but I need to make sure everything goes as planned or it won't happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came across an old highschool photo book. Memories. <endOfText>
<human> good memories ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah a lot of good memories. <endOfText>
<human> thats always good  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was annoyeed when i was told that i had to work last weekend <endOfText>
<human> Did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldnt go do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you have some special plans for the weekend that you couldnt go do? <endOfText>
<human> i wanted to go fishing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working on getting a lot better at my job. It requires a lot of studying. <endOfText>
<human> what do you do ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait until next week! <endOfText>
<human> What is going on next week? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> I wouldn't want to do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This has been a very long summer. <endOfText>
<human> why is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recommended me for a job at his company. I am so happy he thought of me. <endOfText>
<human> How nice of him!! you should be thankful to him!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad. My youngest son starts kindergarten tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it is a bittersweet moment.  I can relate myself.  It takes some getting used to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had left my house for the day, and my neighbor called me and told me I had left my garage door open.  I was very appreciative because someone could have easily robbed me <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah that's couldn't have been good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Girlfriend forgot her lunch, about to go bring it to her. It's going to seem like I'm doing something really nice, but I wasn't doing anything important anyway. Would rather her not have to inconvenience herself since she's at work <endOfText>
<human> Hey it's a win win! You get the nice points and she gets her lunch!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey it's a win win! You get the nice points and she gets her lunch! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. I feel a little guilty getting easy credit for something that isn't a big deal, but whatever I can do to help out, I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising seeing someone eat a 3 lbs burger for a free tshirt <endOfText>
<human> I'll bet it was! That must have been an enormous burger! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea it was, and it was kinda gross towards the end <endOfText>
<human> Haha! I'd need a lot more than a free tshirt to eat a 3 pound burger! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so angry! I lent my friend my expensive, designer dress and not only did she stain it, it's torn!! <endOfText>
<human> did you beat her down ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved into a new state recently, and there's a lot to do, but I don't have any friends in the new place I stay at. <endOfText>
<human>  I was late to an appointment recently because I got stuck in a traffic jam.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was late to an appointment recently because I got stuck in a traffic jam. <endOfText>
<human> How late were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother pulled a mean prank <endOfText>
<human> What kind of prank did he pull on you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No. Afterwards, I realized it was pretty funny, actually. <endOfText>
<human> Well, what kind of prank was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother snapped my skatebaord <endOfText>
<human> how soon after did the beatdown come ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i couldnt get the day off <endOfText>
<human> Did you talk to your boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted to go with my family on vacation but I couldnt go and it sucks. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a shame. Could you perhaps join them for a couple of days? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No I cant you know how work can be! ugh adult life right. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah. Oh to be a kid again and not have to deal with all that! So sorry you're going to miss time with your family. Hopefully they'll take lots of photos! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think I should drive in town today, I have a bad feeling. <endOfText>
<human> what ended up happening? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did they leave a note? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im going to the beach after work, and I am so excited, cant wait.... counting down every little second. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds pretty awesome. How long until you get off from work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 2 more hours and i am outtie! <endOfText>
<human> hahaha hope you have fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm making guacamole for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> Did someone give you a recipe or did you google it? Keep tasting it until you get what you want!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did someone give you a recipe or did you google it? Keep tasting it until you get what you want! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I definitely google'd it. I hope it turns out well. It does have a lot of good reviews. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got a box of ramen. Should last me through the week. <endOfText>
<human> I love ramen! not the healthiest food in the world but tastes good and hits the spot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting a scary type of new job today. <endOfText>
<human> Exciting, is it hazardous scary or more excited scary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big test coming up, I wish time would hurry up so I can get it over with. <endOfText>
<human> Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next Tuesday! <endOfText>
<human> I wish you a lot of luck, and try not to let it get the best of you ( way easy to say... way hard to actually do. i know )  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ahhh i bet your nerves are thru the roof. Whens the test date? <endOfText>
<human> Next Tuesday!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been waiting a few weeks for a bird cage to come, and it was supposed to come today but it hasnt. :( Bummed. <endOfText>
<human> Have you asked the merchant why it is late? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah to no response of course. I am upset about it. <endOfText>
<human> I would be too! They should be more diligent with their shipping estimates! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on a person I have been in a relationship with. <endOfText>
<human> Did you ever get cheated on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, Fall is almost upon us at last. <endOfText>
<human> Is Fall your favorite season? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the city last week, I saw a homeless man picking through the garbage <endOfText>
<human> Did you stop to help him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This dude keeps blowing up my girlfriend's phone <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, is he flirting with her? Does he know she is a relationship with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start my new job tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What will you be doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanksgiving is almost here. <endOfText>
<human> i know i am really exited, what do you have planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just recently applied for my dream college <endOfText>
<human> That is so awesome, have you been accepted yet/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a tornado touch down near our house, only about 1 mile away. It ended up being a deadly one too. <endOfText>
<human> Any damage to where you live ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a lot of damage all around, minor damage to my home but it was real bad <endOfText>
<human> I hope you can get it all cleaned up without too much trouble. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever felt alone in a crowd. <endOfText>
<human> Probably once or twice in my life, but I dont go anywhere alone so... :/  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Probably once or twice in my life, but I dont go anywhere alone so... :/ <endOfText>
<human> I sometimes feel this way. It's kinda sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother has developed a habit of prank calling me. <endOfText>
<human> That would be annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I bought myself a new gadget today <endOfText>
<human> That is always fun to do.  What did you get yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is very cool.   I like tech that is practical but also fun to use. <endOfText>
<human> Well this one didn't even work for me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a call from my friend.  Him and his wife are expecting their first kid and were just told they are having triplets! <endOfText>
<human> Do you know what their names will be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no idea.  I do not think they have them picked out yet.  They are still trying to wrap their head around having three kids. <endOfText>
<human> Have you had any kids yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I found out that my sister is having twins! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's wonderful twins seem really cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled some sweet and sour sauce on my friends couch while I was eating chicken nuggets. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, were you able to clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is my friends birthday today and we had lunch together. <endOfText>
<human> What did you guys eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope I will win the contest I have entered! <endOfText>
<human> What contest is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got promoted to a line cook and it couldn't have gone smoother. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That's a very good job. What kind of food do you prepare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm due to get a raise. <endOfText>
<human> How long has it been since you have gotten a raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to steal a candy bar from the store. <endOfText>
<human> Not worth the risk is it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a loud crash sound outside my house last night, I thought someone was trying to break in. <endOfText>
<human> Seriously?  What was going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so humbled by all the gifts we've received for our new baby... totally was not expecting it <endOfText>
<human> That is such an exciting time and really nice of everyone to do that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I am going to meet some old friends from school. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds nice, how long has it been <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son hit his first homerun last night. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, great! you must be so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe my daughter performed so well in the recital. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! You must be very proud of her. What kind of recital was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved out to the middle of nowhere. Sometimes when I'm home the loneliness gets tough. <endOfText>
<human> Could you call people? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I barely passed my english class. <endOfText>
<human> that is lucky do you talk much in class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always like to eat at my favorite restaurant a few times a week and encourage others to in the hopes it can stay afloat. <endOfText>
<human> Its good that you like it so much. Why are you worried that it will close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to cross over a fence but ended up tearing my jeans <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did anyone see <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week my mother passed away <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Were you able to be there when she passed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to church with a friend recently. <endOfText>
<human> How was the service? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom threw away my Nintendo, I was pissed. <endOfText>
<human> Did you dig it out of the trash? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I learned I was given a raise.  It was out of the blue, I was not expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> That's a great surprise! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter has a cold today, so I'm taking care of her. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that? Is it a bad cold? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a bunch of bills in. <endOfText>
<human> That is never a good feeling <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried I wont have enough money to pay for them all <endOfText>
<human> Do you have some bills that you can put off until later? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently went to a race at the local track <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a fun thing to do. What kind of racing did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for Halloween this year. I have so many ideas! I don't even know where to begin. <endOfText>
<human> Yes! I love Halloween. I need to start making plans myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I had a lot to do on my job, I thought I was never going to finish on time. But then a coworker helped me with it. <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of them! I'm glad you got some help <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my local coffee shop this morning. I spaced out and ran into the door spilling coffee all over myself in front of the cute barista. <endOfText>
<human> that is not good, do you have any idea why you spaced out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone asked me to come pick them up at a specific place at a specific time. I was a little busy at the time, but I relented. Then they sat there and took 30 minutes longer than they said they would, and I had to sit around waiting in the car. How are people that inconsiderate? <endOfText>
<human> Are you one of the Uber drivers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am visiting my college kid soon! <endOfText>
<human> That's a special moment. To hopefully see your kids doing better than you and all that jazz. I'm in college but my parents live only a couple hours away, so I just visit them instead, since them coming to me wouldnt be anything too special. But congratulations to you and your kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy with my health right now. I'm at a healthy weight, I have no aches or pain, and I'm still pretty young. I think young people take for granted their ability to not feel physical pain <endOfText>
<human> It's great to hear that you're in such good shape! I need to work on that myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to wear my fathers watch that I inherited. Its a nice reminder of him. <endOfText>
<human> That is a nice way to remember him. Its good that you have something of his to keep his memory alive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to go a week without eating any sweets, to improve my eating habits. Didn't even make it three days before I started indulging. It gets nerve-wracking. Maybe I'm putting too much pressure on it. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, don't be too hard on yourself for that. We're supposed to like that stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very happy that summer is almost over and fall is around the corner. <endOfText>
<human> I used to be that way, because I love holidays and the mood it puts everyone in. But I'm starting to hate how short the fall and winter days are, and how quickly it gets dark. Now that I've been exercising outside more lately, I hate losing that time in the sun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was in a building and I was heading towards an elevator. I was rushing towards it because it was closing. I tripped right as I got in and slammed my head into the wall inside, and then had to hang out with everybody afterward as it slowly went up. Felt so dumb <endOfText>
<human> That must have been painful and a little embarrassing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I went to the garage to look for some tools and found a dead rat instead! <endOfText>
<human> Yikes. I live in the south and we don't get those. Just palmetto bugs (flying roaches). I think I'd rather have those than rats, personally. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm doing a pretty good job balancing work and school right now. School is about to start up again, and I've managed to maintain my savings and pay off my student loans a little bit while still in school. I don't feel like a lot of other students can say that, and I'm happy <endOfText>
<human> I'm so proud of you! That's a lot to deal with all at once!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so proud of you! That's a lot to deal with all at once! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, but I'm glad I'm doing it this way, since it's kind of grounding me and teaching me the harder things I need to learn about not spending too much. I'm still drowning in student loan debt no matter how hard I try, though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can start to see my mother showing early signs of dementia. I feel really helpless about it, since it shows how vulnerable they are. I try to help with small things, but it's sad knowing I won't be able to slow down the effects of it. <endOfText>
<human> That's very sad. My Grandma had that and it is devastating to experience it. I'm told that doing puzzles etc. keeps the brain active and maybe at least delays it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard that too! I try to do some of those here and there, but I get kind of tired of them after a while when I'm not successful. I'm really just dreading her getting much worse and not recognizing me, and having it seem like the past never happened. <endOfText>
<human> I really feel for you. It's not easy, I won't kid you. But at least you understand what's happening and are obviously prepared for the inevitable. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just told a friend I couldn't attend her birthday because I have a headache, but the truth is I prefer to stay home and finish watching a series on Netflix. <endOfText>
<human> I hear you there, it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear you there, it can be more relaxing spending time at home thang going to a hectic party. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but now I feel bad that I did that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I did poorly on a job interview. They called me today with an offer! It feels like it came out of nowhere since I wasnt expecting to hear back from them. <endOfText>
<human> I would be so excited! I'm so proud of you!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would be so excited! I'm so proud of you! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks. Im blown away. I never expected to hear from them again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm transferring to a new job and it's just beena  headache getting the paperwork done. I called my new boss to ask when I come into work, and they said they'd call me back. It's getting pretty late and I've been guarding my phone, but they still haven't called me back. <endOfText>
<human> that's annoying. maybe you should try giving them a call again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate having to buy presents for other people. <endOfText>
<human> Oh. Do you have to buy a lot of presents or do you just not know what to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at my favorite restaurant earlier and everything was tasted better than ever! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That usually doesn't happy, usually that feeling fades with time.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow! That usually doesn't happy, usually that feeling fades with time. <endOfText>
<human> indeed some places go down hill with time but things turned out even better today <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Making decent money with my new job, enough to afford to pay off all of my bills and put some into savings at the end of the month. I guess this is what it's like being an adult. Kind of weird to be on such a stable track for once <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's awesome. You must be feeling pretty content. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching my kids soccer game last weekend. I was floored at how much they have improved. They are passing and challenging so much better. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool to hear. When I have kids, I hope they're the same, and can get into sports, since it offers so much. Good for you for getting them into sports <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a baby kitten outside one day. <endOfText>
<human> Did you bring it in and take care of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While playing baseball with a few friends in my backyard, I knocked the ball over the fence and heard my neighbors window break. We all ran inside and acted like nothing happened. <endOfText>
<human> Did the neighbors come after you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend took my daughter for the weekend so that I could have some alone time with my husband. <endOfText>
<human> How nice! Are you going out or are you going to have a nice night in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece just grated from high school with honors! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I am sure you are very happy and beeming with pride right now. Whats the next step for her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We've had so much rain lately. The ground got saturated and knocked some trees over. They took out a lot of my neighbors yard <endOfText>
<human> How scary!  I hope your neighbors are ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at my favorite restaurant earlier and was feeling better than ever afterwards! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, what kind of restaurant is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents bought my wife and I a new dryer the other day. We had complained to them about our old one, and then a delivery guy showed up with the new one a week late. I was quite surprised! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow a wonderful surprise indeed! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through a box with old papers in it and I found some old letter my Grandpa wrote me when I was a child. <endOfText>
<human> That's really cool. Did it bring back good memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It did! He has since passed away so it made me really miss him. <endOfText>
<human> I'm very sorry for your loss. I'm glad you have the letter from him though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been studying all week for my upcoming Geometry test. I still feel like I am going to fail. I feel so unprepared. <endOfText>
<human> I guarantee you know more than you think! Just be methodical and you'll do just fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Family went out of town today. Since I start school soon, I couldn't go with them. House is empty, just hear some outside noises of passing cars and some birds. Feels a little like I was abandoned, even though no one had any other choice to do anything other than what they did. Oh well <endOfText>
<human> oh im so sorry you felt this way! I hope your mood will get better. maybe watch a good comedy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just spent so much money on my car and now a week later something else broke. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible.. There's nothing more frustrating and deflating in life than unexpected expenses. I hope you're able to cover all of it. I know if I had one right now, I might not be able to manage it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I recently decided we are going to get a puppy! I was really excited when I put the deposit down, but when I went to tell my mom about it she got really negative and talked badly about our decision. It was really frustrating and made me not feel great. <endOfText>
<human> What was she so negative? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to take a flight tomorrow, but there is supposed to be a storm at the time <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's terrible, getting delayed always annoys me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was outside playing with my dogs today and felt wonderful enjoying the nice day! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so nice! I love to be with my dog outside too, even if just watching him play. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a nice lunch... i feel good <endOfText>
<human> that's great, what did you have for lunch? i had some hot dogs and baked beans <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried Red Bull before skiing recently. <endOfText>
<human> How did you like it? Did it give an energy boost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life is pretty good. I have a wonderful family, a good job, and a decent house. Can't complain! <endOfText>
<human> You know there is one thing that might make it even better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was really cool to see that my old high school still looks the same. I had some great times there. <endOfText>
<human> I wish i could go to my old high school. i moved far from it but if i come back i will visit <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in some dog poop while taking a walk the other day, ugh. <endOfText>
<human> Ewww. I hate it when dog owners don't pick up after their pets. We always carried a poop bag with us for when our pooch "went". <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend recently made me a very nice meal while I worked late. I was so grateful. <endOfText>
<human> Thats amazing! he must really really love you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the toilet got clogged and there was poop everywhere, and I had to clean it up. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty gross. Were there other people around? I'm always more nervous about that when people are around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I baked a bunch of cookies for my neighbors. Unfortunately I ate them all instead. I have no self control! <endOfText>
<human> Haha oh no. Sometimes you need a cheat day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a bunch of job interviews last week. I have a good feeling I will get an offer soon. <endOfText>
<human> It's good to be confident. I am sure you will get some good news soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mailman didn't make it by my house today and failed to deliver my order. He's usually never even late. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Was your order important? Have you called the post office to find out what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was flipping through looking at all my baby pictures. <endOfText>
<human> Awe! Hopefully they were cute pictures <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new city. i am looking forward to having a new start. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! It's not easy moving to a new place, but it's great fun getting to know your new home! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is. im so optimistic that things will be better for me now that i took a chance and left my old life. <endOfText>
<human> That takes a lot of courage. I'm proud of you! I moved last year and it's both fun and scary at the same time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down my street and a big fly flew into my mouth. I tried to spit it out but it wouldn't leave. It tasted so nasty. <endOfText>
<human> Did you wind up eating it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is soon! <endOfText>
<human> Happy early birthday! Do you have any plans? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking home the other day, and ran into a stray dog. It chased me for quite a distance. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrifying, did you get away from it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really really need that check to come, in the mail. <endOfText>
<human> Have you been expecting it long?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you been expecting it long? <endOfText>
<human> Yes its been about 4 weeks now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started a new job and I noticed a lot of the people gossip about each other. I'm not sure how long I can keep working here. <endOfText>
<human> You dont like to gossip at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No not really. But especially at work. It makes things uncomfortable. <endOfText>
<human> I understadn that, Others business is a very sensitive subject <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I protect my little brother like my life depends on it, I have to <endOfText>
<human> Is this brother of your's a lot younger than you are? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Guess what I got for my birthday! <endOfText>
<human> What What, tell me? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom has been out of town for weeks, I hope she comes back soon. <endOfText>
<human> You must miss her. But I'm sure she'll be back before you know it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was upset when my favorite TV show was canceled. Now I don't have anything to watch. <endOfText>
<human> Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch. <endOfText>
<human> I will look but I hate it when they cancel good shows. It seems to happen too often. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving home from work and a driver cut in front of me and made me almost hit another car. <endOfText>
<human> Did you flip the bird? Some people are so rude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I flipped a lot of birds and spewed some pretty angry words too. People drive so stupid sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> You should also post the license plate on social media. Sometimes public shaming does wonders. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My teacher said If i do what she says she can guarantee ill pass <endOfText>
<human> Well it's a teacher's goal to make sure his or her students succeed.  She wants you to do your best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was the day I had been practicing for years for. <endOfText>
<human> Must feel good to get it over with. How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went a bunch of job interviews last week. I have a good feeling that I will land something soon. <endOfText>
<human> Yes! I bet it will, did you go in and kill it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store the other day and I didn't notice when my wallet fell on the ground. Luckily a man picked it up and found me! I was so happy! <endOfText>
<human> Thats amazing, I have actually had that happen to be before in my life, I was so happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe it, 3rd try and stilla  fail. <endOfText>
<human> What did you fail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes my daughters have too much homework. <endOfText>
<human> I almost feel like homework is counter productive. Shouldn't the schools be teaching the kids enough during their 8 hours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent a ton of money on computer upgrades and purchasing a new game I was excited for. Turns out it's actually pretty boring. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure there'll be other games it will be useful for. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I had really good job interview. They just called to say they went with someone else. Im a little bummed about that. <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame, do you have anything else lined up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I had a shift at work cancelled. Often that can mean that the rest of the week gets cancelled. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a bad thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the mall the other day and I smelled some cinnamon rolls. It reminded me of my childhood and was such a good time! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that cinnabon smell can be so enticing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking crap to this guy for like 10 minutes and he all of a sudden just knocks me out <endOfText>
<human> Talk crap get smacked <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even if I were filthy rich I would have no problem ordering McDonald's at a drive-thru.  I'm a man of simple taste <endOfText>
<human> mcdonalds is honestly gross to me though, rich or poor. i dont eat it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I gor home from work the other day to find my cat had peed on the carpet. The smell was horrible. <endOfText>
<human> oh my god, thats it so gross, cat pee is the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The ride I was going on went upside downs three times in total. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like quite a ride. Are you a fan of rollercoasters in general? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is going pretty well at this time. <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear. Anything new going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got in a wreck today. Someone cut me off on a wet road and slammed their brakes causing me to wreck. It makes me furious someone can drive so dangerously. <endOfText>
<human> Did it do much damage to your car ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my allstart team trophy and it shattered everywhere <endOfText>
<human> Dang, that really blows. What was it made of, glass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally made the full climb, I mastered to cargo rope. <endOfText>
<human> How long did it take?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How long did it take? <endOfText>
<human> Maybe 30 minutes or so, for my first try <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought my son was doing good in school. When I got his report card I found out he failed his math class. I wish he had told me he was in trouble. <endOfText>
<human> It's hard for kids to do that. Maybe he was just bored? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I've been working at my job for several years and I'm very comfortable here. <endOfText>
<human> Thats a nice feeling to have job security. Do you enjoy your work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year has been going pretty good so far. <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Have you had good things happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I packed my bag in advance, and really thoroughly, when I went to the hospital to have my baby. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds you you didnt leave anything out. It feels good to bell prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Let me tell you something, i never win anything but yesterday i won 75$ in a lotery! i know it's not much but i felt so lucky <endOfText>
<human> That's really awesome! I never win anything either... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work in finance and just got a raise and new office. <endOfText>
<human> that's great! congrats! I'm glad to hear that. you deserved it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been liking the hot weather lately. <endOfText>
<human> Me either. ITs too much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY neighbors have been really nice since my car broke down <endOfText>
<human> That's good. What have they done for you ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I baked a cake for my kid's birthday party. Somehow the dog jumped on the table and started scarfing it down. I was furious with him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you scold the dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rip on my friends and make mean jokes about them alot.  But that doesn't mean I hate them in fact I look out for them like they are my brothers <endOfText>
<human> Its really good that you have friends like that. I'm sure they realize that you are just joking with them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really good at my job. My boss can always count on me. <endOfText>
<human> That's great.  What kind of work do you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work in sales. I'm a great closer. <endOfText>
<human> well you must have good social skills then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am making my wife dinner with this new rub I bought for the chicken.  It <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new phone a few weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice!  What kind of phone did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ITs almost my birthday <endOfText>
<human> Oh, now that's exciting! Do you have any plans to do it? Celebrating with anyone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a gas station with my friend and we both bought a lottery ticket. She won a little bit of money! I was a little mad that I didn't get anything. <endOfText>
<human> oh man, sorry to hear that. i mean good for your friend but i feel you. i never win anything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just saw the most gross and disturbing thing running down the street. It was a backed old man. <endOfText>
<human> a backed old man? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss was diagnosed with cancer earlier this summer. I've been trying very hard to work extra to make things easier for her. <endOfText>
<human> That is really kind of you, many people would not bother. I hope that she wins her battle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is wonderful! Luckily for her, because of her chemo site she won't loose her hair. <endOfText>
<human> That is excellent, and you are a truly giving person. I wish her the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss watching Saturday morning cartoons <endOfText>
<human> Why's that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped and fell in front of the cute barista yesterday. I dont feel like showing my face there again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! If it helps they probably don't remember. That stuff filters out faster than you would think! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I quit my job recently, which was great. But I didn't have time to tell my good friend before leaving. I feel so bad now. <endOfText>
<human> Im sure they understand. That is a tough position to be in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe it when I saw my dog had jumped in my baby's crib. I don't know how he got up there. <endOfText>
<human> Did he hurt the baby? Most of the time they are just curious  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did he hurt the baby? Most of the time they are just curious <endOfText>
<human> He was just licking her and she was laughing. I guess I need to look at moving the crib somewhere the dog can't get to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on my way home and I saw a little cat! It was so cute I just had to take care of it <endOfText>
<human> Aww, did you take it home with you? It's great to adopt strays. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sucks seeing others make more money than me. <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand that feeling. It's very frustrating. All you can do is try your best and try not to pay too much attention to that aspect. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's true but social media makes it hard to be okay with my best. <endOfText>
<human> I think we all have our good days and bad days. Just keeping plugging along and I bet it gets better soon. It recently did for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought my job interview went well last week but I just found out I didn't get the job. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a bet for $50 I had forgotten all about. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is the best. Did you buy anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been talking to this girl that I like for awhile now.  I think that I am finally going to ask her on a date <endOfText>
<human> Do it! She may say yes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and I dropped my wallet without knowing. Luckily some nice man gave it to me later in the trip! I was so surprised! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thats really lucky of you.  Its good to find nice people out there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ordered delivery from a new vegan restaurant <endOfText>
<human> Was it good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a speech in front of a few people I have never met. I was a little scared <endOfText>
<human> About what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is pretty smart and reliable.  I think I'd have enough faith to go into business with him <endOfText>
<human> That's great you have such great friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend was cheating on me and I didn't know. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that's a bummer.  Did you leave her or are you giving her another shot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I coooking dinner for the first time for my boyfriend tonight <endOfText>
<human> That is nice of you. I hope he appreciated it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My puppy died suddenly a year ago. I still miss him like crazy. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my son's middle school graduation and he go so many things! I was so happy! <endOfText>
<human> You must be very proud. That is awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on what I thought was a horrible interview. They called me today with an offer! that caught me completely off guard. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is. I thought I did terrible but I guess not. <endOfText>
<human> That shows how lucky you can be! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece cut my hair accidentally while she was playing around with some scissors <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope that you were able to get someone to fix it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat just died. I have had her for like 20 years. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm so sorry to hear that. My cat is getting old, she's 15. I'm scared she'll pass soon too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking back at my older self I've come a long way.  It's pretty amazing really, I was such a bum now I'm a real man, living on my own self-employed with my own car paying my own bills. Like waking up from a nightmare haha <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it can be difficult to get your footing when starting out. It sounds like you enjoy your life now and have something to be proud of. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a cell phone store last week talking to a girl who worked there and she was telling me a lot about her life. <endOfText>
<human> That's... exciting.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped in bubble gum in the parking lot at work. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks, I've had that happen to me as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watch youtube videos all day because I'm so bored <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. Maybe you should try and find something that your good at and do that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the Acropolis when I was on vacation. It was pretty cool! <endOfText>
<human> Cool! Did you go to Greece for vacation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished finals. I should be getting my grades back any day now. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I hope that it goes well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an amazing and brilliant wife. I'm so lucky! <endOfText>
<human> I am so happy for you. Doe she make you feel special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were all so proud of my nephew the other day <endOfText>
<human> What did he do to inspire such pride <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He got his first credit card the other day. He has a Limit of $300 <endOfText>
<human> Nice. That is pretty awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked a couple of days ago when I made over $100 without even trying.  But then I remembered money is just energy and flows to whoever is open to it <endOfText>
<human> Wow thats really impressive.  Well I need to be open.  Flow to me money, flow to me... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview recently and I think I did great. I am pretty sure I will get the job. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds great, I hope you get it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like my friend's Chanel bag, but I would never spend that much money on an accessory <endOfText>
<human> Maybe she will let you borrow it. Or maybe if she gets a new one she will give it to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got concert tickets for my birthday. I thought the show was sold out. My girlfriend got them for me. <endOfText>
<human> You got an awesome girlfriend. Who are you going to see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got the coolest haircut. He got a purple mohawk. I wish I could do that with my hair. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa that is out there. Takes some real confidence to rock that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really miss my family. it sucks to be 800 miles away <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling too. I'm a 1000 miles from my family.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know the feeling too. I'm a 1000 miles from my family. <endOfText>
<human> it's horrid isn't  it. i'm so sorry you are going thru that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah same to you. I'm counting down the days until I get to see them again. <endOfText>
<human> when do you think you will be able to see them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a really interesting letter in the mail. My Aunt left me a lot of money. <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness. that is crazy. i've never had anything like that happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing this chat room thing, and I walked away for a minute. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah?  How did that go?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah?  How did that go? <endOfText>
<human> Well one minutes turned to ten, and the next thing I knew, the chatroom had expired, and I had stranded the person waiting on me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The package that was supposed to be delievered today was delayed by UPS <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  Did they give a reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried I won't pass the CPA exam. I have been studying for weeks and am afraid I won't remember the material. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, you gotta pay more attention to your textbook maybe <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss being able to talk to my parents, I don't live near them anymore <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Maybe you can call them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't pay my rent this month because I have some financial problems. The landlord have put a paper on a wall of the building notifying my neighbors that I didn't pay my rent. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that's really cruel of him to do that. I'm sure you're trying the best you can <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes my cat understands my commands and I get really excited <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is nice. What does he understand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from work the other morning, and wouldn't you know it, there were a told of old dirty dishes in the sink. <endOfText>
<human> Who left all the dirty dishes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm off work and at home and relaxing. My day is finished. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, have a beer for me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend stepped up his money game last week, I was surprised and pretty proud of him <endOfText>
<human> It's always good when a friend meets his potential <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I went home, my dog didn't recognize me anymore <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness that is horrible. how come it didn't recognize you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a doctors appointment this thursday and i'm very worried about it. <endOfText>
<human> What's wrong? What are you visiting the doctor for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my boyfriend's birthday cake when he was at work <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! before he got to have it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really excited for this week, but now im kind of bummed <endOfText>
<human> Why, did someone cancel on you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I hear some songs I remember my time in high school <endOfText>
<human> What was high school like for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is going to love my baby shower present that I got her, I just know it! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! How far along is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone throw some trash from a moving car yesterday. I was so angry. <endOfText>
<human> That is infuriating. I dont see how some people are so unaware. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my pet iguana passed away recently. Izzy and I were best buds. I miss him so much <endOfText>
<human> That's sad, how old was your pet izzy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My puppy learned to tap the bell to go outside very quickly! <endOfText>
<human> Well that's quite the accomplishment! How did you train her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Crappy day today.  My car broke  down on the side of the road. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.  You get it fixed already or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling very positive about my future lately.  Big money opportunities everywhere kaching kaching bling bling burrr <endOfText>
<human> Awesome.  Sounds like you are defintely on top of the world today! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm going to the doctor on thursday i'm very worried but i'm trying to stay calm <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! I hope that it goes well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure it will be ok. It's probably nothing. <endOfText>
<human> i hope so. i just want to feel better. thank you for your kindness. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found an old report card as I was cleaning out my basement. It brought back a lot of memories <endOfText>
<human> oh how exciting. what grade was it from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Elementary school. Third grade I think? <endOfText>
<human> that is so sweet. it would be fun if you have children so you can share it with them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife left for a business trip, so now I will be all by myself and our dog. <endOfText>
<human> What is the longest you have been apart? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always complain, nag, and treat my husband like crap. Which makes me feel like crap. I need to change/ <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that is quite the confession. But you know, it's good that you recognize that you need to change a behavior. Very mature. Not everyone has that same ability to be honest with themselves, and you should feel proud about that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm thankful for all my past mistakes.  They've helped me grow in a big way <endOfText>
<human> I've always gone by if you learned from your mistakes you have no reason to regret them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In previous job, I was laid off. I felt like everything around me was failling apart. I felt terrible bad and cried. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is awful. I have been fired before it is just the worst. Have things gotten better since then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a review at work recently. I was told I am doing very well. <endOfText>
<human> That is good. Is it your manager who did the review? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really upsetting dream last night. <endOfText>
<human> i hate when that happens. my dreams are always so vivid they feel real. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah this one was really upsetting because I was giving a presentation at work. And I was naked. <endOfText>
<human> oh my word. that is like a nightmare not a bad dream. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it was terrible. <endOfText>
<human> i'm so sorry you had to go thru that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm so worried about my appointment on thursday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I hope everything goes well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're gonna be moving soon, and it doesn't look like we are going to be able to take our chickens. <endOfText>
<human> Do you live on a farm? It will probably be nice to move to a city and get away from those chickens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I steal food from my roommate and I feel a bit guilty about it. <endOfText>
<human> do you do it out of necessity or because of the thrill of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do it because his food was really really good. <endOfText>
<human> how about you get some of the same food for yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm very worried about coming off too bossy in front of my boss and director. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think that being bossy. You are just really concerned with getting a job done efficiently <endOfText>
<human> i'm honestly just a really hard worker and my coworkers are very much slackers <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having my first date with a woman that I met at party. I am very nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> Just wear cologne, dress sharp, use mouthwash, and let her do all the talking.  And you'll be just fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet iguana Ricado just die. I miss him. <endOfText>
<human> Aw I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure he was a good pet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think something bad could happen on my vacation. I should cancel. <endOfText>
<human> Why? What are you worried about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I set up my old Nintendo system and had so much fun playing it. It really reminded me of when I was a child. <endOfText>
<human> I loved playing that!  They look so outdated now.  Good times! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted some popcorn with my movie the other day so I put some in the microwave without thinking about how old it could be. I guess it was really old and it had literally exploded all over my microwave. I cant figure out how to clean it up. <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness that is horrid. i'd think with hot water and degreaser. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope that i can see my family by the end of the year <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow where are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just heard back from my Doctor and I need surgery. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry are you going to be alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has bunch of spiders as pets, but I can't stand them. They creep me out! <endOfText>
<human> I would be afraid one of them would get out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying to convince my friend to hop on board this business venture.  I'm staying positive I'm sure he'll come around <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like it could be a great success.  Do you both work well together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm watching my neice and nephew for a week while my brother and his wife go out of town. I think it'll be fun and tough. <endOfText>
<human> Nice how old are they <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't notice it until I got home from work, but I had a huge ketchup stain on my blouse! <endOfText>
<human> oh, thats embarassing.  I hate it when that happens.    <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh, thats embarassing.  I hate it when that happens. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, and none of my co-workers told me! I would hope someone would let me know! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had planned on cooking a steak tonight but, I found it turned rotten when I came home today. <endOfText>
<human> Ew, yeah it is not worth risking getting food poisoning! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have an appointment with the doctor on thursday and it has me so worried <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Have you already had some tests or is this the first time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally finished up my law school application and sent it off today. <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting, how long do you have to wait tell you find out if you are accepted or not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother just got his dream job recently, so I am very happy for him! <endOfText>
<human> That is great news!  I am sure he feels a great deal of accomplisment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my neighbor is having work done on his house.  Every morning at 6 am I wake up to the noise of hammers and drills next door. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so annoying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Very much so.  They were supposed to be done last week, but they are still going at it. <endOfText>
<human> I hope they finish up soon. That could drive someone crazy going on for so long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first date with a woman that I met at a party didn't go as expected. <endOfText>
<human> Really? How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a family gathering one time and an uncle gave me a red drink that I thought was strawberry. <endOfText>
<human> How old are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently went to the circus, and I was so amazed at how the performers do their tricks! <endOfText>
<human> They are really impressive.  What circus was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke into my car and ripped everything out, even the side speakers! I looked like the Hulk that night when I saw the wreckage. <endOfText>
<human> Did you call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do not like when I order a hamburger with no ketchup and they still put it on. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst. I have that happen all the time but with onions.  Its the only thing they have to do so get it right! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i worry about looking foolish in front of strangers <endOfText>
<human> Why would you be worried? Do you have three arms? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have the city come out today and check my water meter. <endOfText>
<human> how come. is their something wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been waiting on some health result tests. It was making me very nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I hope they come back with the desired result.  Good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my job and I'm thankful it gives me full autonomy of time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I feel you! I have full control over my schedule, it is so nice! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kind of bummed now since I was supposed to meet my best friend later tonight, but he got stuck at work suddenly. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow, that does suck! Hopefully you can push it to another day this week. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new car, I am so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome what kind of car is it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back in kindergarten I peed my pants once...maan I was super ashamed hahaha <endOfText>
<human> Did the entire class laugh at you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked that my dog bite the neighbor. <endOfText>
<human> Why did your dog do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor just purchased my dream car and parks it in his driveway everyday.  I feel like the car is taunting me. <endOfText>
<human> You must be a little jealous.  Maybe its time to save up for your own dream car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had one beer left when I got home and spilled the whole thing right after I opened it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That is disappointing.  Did you have to run out and get more? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I guess one night without beer is not going to kill you. <endOfText>
<human> I think i'll live, and save a few calories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow I have to give a presentation at work and I just found out that the Vice President of the company is going to be there. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy I hope you get some sleep tonight! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching jeopardy with my friend the other day, and the cateogry was british literature. <endOfText>
<human> Did you know all the answers?  I wouldn't be too good at it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am afraid of bats, I can't even watch Batman movies. <endOfText>
<human> That is awful, those movies are pretty good minus the george clooney and ben afflack films. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just lost my job. It really sucks <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully you qualify for unemployment while you get back on your feet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, two coworkers are making too much noise. They are bothering me in my work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I have the same problem at my work! How do you deal with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a doctor's appointment on thursday that has me a little worried <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure it'll go fine! Are you doing okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that. I hope the doctor can give you some treatment options. <endOfText>
<human> i hope so too. i makes me so crazy to not know what's going on with my body <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At work, we went together for lunch. When it was time to pay, I notice that I forgot my wallet at the office. <endOfText>
<human> What happens next. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I'm nervous to play this game.  Because if it's someone who can't hold a conversation I get the feeling of wanting to strangle them on the other side of the computer. And I'm really not that kind of guy <endOfText>
<human> I undersand. Do you want to strangle me? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared to walk home alone <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were cleaning out my parents house the other day and found some pretty cool stuff <endOfText>
<human> brought back some old memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a "thank you" card sent to me from a co-worker in a different department for helping them. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you to help them.  What did you do to help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am always super amazed when people have real talent <endOfText>
<human> What talents do you speak of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love the relationship i have with my husband. we have an amazing marriage. <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing to hear.  There is nothing like a great relationship! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Did they leave a note or anything?  I would be really upset too.  Were there any cameras that could have seen who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I should really stop expecting so much from people in this game. I get a good partner convo going, thinking that every conversation will be the same...then I get some idiot and lose all hope in humanity <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally passed gas while talking to a coworker. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's...kinda funny not gonna lie <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm leaving town tomorrow for a mini vacation. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. you must be very excited. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a job offer but I am not sure if I should take it or not. <endOfText>
<human> What makes you unsure? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet the other day <endOfText>
<human> How fun! What kind of pet is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband and i are trying to have a baby <endOfText>
<human> Aww! I bet that is so exciting! Do you want a girl or boy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be super self-conscious and afraid to say anything stupid when I was younger...I'd get humiliated at the dumbest things but these days I've got pretty thick skin <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you grew out of your shell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a new Bugatti. <endOfText>
<human> Dang nice! Bugattis are freakin slick, definitely a dream car...what does your friend do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an ice cream cake for my birthday and it was really good. It was rather big so we had plenty left over we kept in the freezer. My husband took it out to defrost it enough to cut it while I wasn't home and totally forgot about it and it all melted. I was upset. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that! It sounds like an honest mistake.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that! It sounds like an honest mistake. <endOfText>
<human> I feel that its more like inconsiderate. My parents got me the cake and he forgot about it because he was losing in his video game. Honest mistake? Okay but seriously inconsiderate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other night <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, were you alone? Hopefully you didn't have to go very far! That can be super scary for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a test coming up and I'm feeling pretty good about it. <endOfText>
<human> Nice did you prepare well for it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to have faith in strangers. Now I walk around with a switch blade ready for whatever <endOfText>
<human> Really? Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've gotten jumped twice <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that's rough... maybe you should think about moving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped at the gym the other day. I turned around and about five people saw me. I felt stupid. <endOfText>
<human> I would have been so embarrassed! Hopefully you didn't get hurt at all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No it wasnt bad at all. I just looked like a bumbling buffoon. <endOfText>
<human> Could have been worse!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe how dumb I am sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when i didnt get this weekend off <endOfText>
<human> I hate working on the weekend.  Do you have to work this weekend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was kid, a kid in the neighborhood was trying to exhort money from me. I was terrible afraid. <endOfText>
<human> oh my god that is so scary. what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a coworker that comes in to work late everyday and takes a million breaks <endOfText>
<human> That is annoying. Did you told your manager about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister died in a freak accident, my heart is broken. <endOfText>
<human> oh my god. i am so sorry. i have two sisters and know that pain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i come in to work every day early and make sure i'm ready to go by the time my shift starts <endOfText>
<human> That is good, I am sure your boss loves that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the park today, and my son pulled down his pants, and started peeing on the grass. <endOfText>
<human> Hahaha, I dont mean to laugh but I'm assuming he is young and kids are pretty funny.  Did anyone else see it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah he's two and lots of people saw him do it.  He just wants to be like our dog, but doesn't know his limits. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure the other people thought kids will be kids.  He'll learn eventually! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was crushed when i didnt get the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> Now that's just not right! Weekends are supposed to be for relaxing and hanging out with friends, not slaving away for the man! Hopefully you didn't have to cancel any plans... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am trying to save up some money but i'm having such a hard time making it happen <endOfText>
<human> You can do it, you just need to start right away <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt a little cocky this morning after working out. It was a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> i always feel like i'm on top of the world after i workout.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i always feel like i'm on top of the world after i workout. <endOfText>
<human> Its the best feeling in the world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our team have achieved the best project in IT department. <endOfText>
<human> what project is that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Is he doing this for a show or a competition? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea it was free if he could eat it and he got a t shirt <endOfText>
<human> Terrible. So he is making himself unhealthy for a t shirt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get a little sappy when I see puppies on facebook. It makes me want one <endOfText>
<human> What kind would you get <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from work and dog had pooped on the floor <endOfText>
<human> Did you discipline her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bit worried about the future today. <endOfText>
<human> why what happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait until next week <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store and I had to bag my own groceries. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's pretty annoying. Aren't they supposed to have people there who do that for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been having nightmares every night. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. What happens during your nightmare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter scored the winning shot in her basketball game last week. I was so happy for her. <endOfText>
<human> Great to have a daughter in basketball! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I are my roommates pizza, I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have not had any alcohol for a week. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, do you like to drink? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, when I got promoted to manager, I was very suprised because I was not expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats a nice suprise <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to build a kitchen island from IKEA. <endOfText>
<human> I love IKEA, they have good meatballs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got back from a three month trip. I am really missing all the friends I made along the way. <endOfText>
<human> But it's good that you made friends though, right? Will you still be able to keep in touch with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother asked me to church yesterday. It was a nice feeling and gesture from him <endOfText>
<human> did you go ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was angry when i saw someone put a dent in my car <endOfText>
<human> That was rude. Did they stop <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband and i are trying to get pregnant by the end of the year <endOfText>
<human> Good luck are you hoping for a boy or girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so exciting. <endOfText>
<human> i hope we can make it finally happen for us. we've been trying for over 6 years now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I begin my new job next week. I am really nervous about starting. <endOfText>
<human> it will be exciting. what will you be doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset I didn't get to go to Hawaii. <endOfText>
<human> why didnt you go ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger for a free t-shirt <endOfText>
<human> That is a lot of meat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i made some potatoes that my mom used to make when i was a kid it made me miss home <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that sounds good to me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to the gym tomorrow, I have a good feeling <endOfText>
<human> good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just moved into a new home. Its a nice place that makes me a little envious of him <endOfText>
<human> It can be tough when friends have things that might be considered better than what you have.  Maybe it can be used as motivation <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went to work yesterday wearing two different shoes.  I was not fully awake when I was getting around in the morning.  Not my best moment. <endOfText>
<human> I have done that. It happens to the best of us <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I thought i saw a good friend and the mall and started waving like crazy...... it wasn't her lol <endOfText>
<human> oh that was awkward <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> What kind of pet is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my brain is full.  I am ready as I can be! <endOfText>
<human> Ready for what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I find it unfair that one of my coworker got promoted and not me. I envy him. <endOfText>
<human> Thats not fair! what has he done that you havent done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever remember stuff you did as a kid out of the blue, and retroactively feel bad about it? I remembered this time we went to my father's friend's house, and while the adults were busy I ate some of the white stuffing from their oreos, and hid the cookies underneath their mattress and couch cushions. <endOfText>
<human> i cant say that i do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to get approved for the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> That's nice! How are you gonna spend your weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my mom got out of rehab and was clean, I was happy for her. She worked hard for it <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow.  I hope she's still doing well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was discussing phone bills with my friend.  He told me how his parents pay for his phone bills <endOfText>
<human> That must be nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a letter in the main today from my cousin. He was overseas and thinking of me. It was a nice shock <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. How long has your cousin been overseas? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a $100 pizza hut gift card. It's a meager winning, but hey, pizza! <endOfText>
<human> Have you used it yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love seeing a gorgeous girl at a bar shoot down 5 guys, and then end up giving me her number...makes me feel pretty superior hahaha <endOfText>
<human> Oh damn. So why'd she pick you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom dropped off some food for me out of the blue. I miss her cooking. <endOfText>
<human> Nice nothing better than homemade mom lunches...what did she bring you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have held on to my old Nintendo even though it broke many years ago. Its a great reminder of the first video game system I owned. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome. i wish i still had mine.  I sold it a couple years ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really mad at the supermarket today.  I felt like they shouldnt treat customers like that <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i took my drivers test at the end of it i wasw hopeful to pass it <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were anxious to know how you did! Did you study up with friends or family leading up to the driver's test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cooked for 20 people. All thank to Youtube. <endOfText>
<human> What did you cook <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was happy to get the weekend off <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear. Are you usually really busy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to buy some cake this weekend. Been craving cakes. <endOfText>
<human> what kind of cake are you going to get ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I stubbed my toe and cracked my toenail tonight. <endOfText>
<human> That is a horrible pain <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the doctor last week. I was little unsure of going because I hate needles <endOfText>
<human> I know needles suck but, its always a good decision to go to the doctor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking forward to my date tonight. I just knew it would go good <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear it went well. So you do have the second date planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend broke up with his girlfriend of 10 years after she lost a lot of weight. <endOfText>
<human> He did not like the way she looked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm been preparing my lunches with a bit more effort for the last couple of months, and I'm noticing some weight loss because I've been taking extra effort in making them. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is actually a very good thing to do. And it also saves momey! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had dented my car door <endOfText>
<human> That's not good. Guess they didn't leave their information, hu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> nope no info left <endOfText>
<human> Well, that's classy.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a date with my crush this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> oh thats nice, good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure miss when I was young living with my parents. No bills or work. Free food and board. <endOfText>
<human> You'll miss it now.  But you'll be grateful once you get your money right.  There's no better freedom than real adulthood, Young Padawan <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt ahve trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> I thought your brothers dog wasn't to be trusted. No crash, I was lucky to get out of the way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a few interviews this week. Im really wishing that I land one of these jobs. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is really exciting. You must be anxious waiting for a response. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped over my own two feet down the busiest aisle in the grocery store and everyone laughed. <endOfText>
<human> Wonder why they laughed. It's not like everyone hasn't done something embrassing like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't take my bro out for his birthday this past weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Did something come up where you couldn't make it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really upset at work today <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was mad when i couldnt leave work on time <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. Why couldn't you leave work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really worry about climate change. <endOfText>
<human> yea? i think its the same there is just more coverage of everything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah and that makes me optomistic that we will figure it out. <endOfText>
<human> i hope we do but it will probably be after im dead and gone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I only put my faith in people doing financially better than me giving me advice. <endOfText>
<human> Yea. I get ya there. It's like having a fat doctor give you diet advice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my friend have so many memories at the neighborhood playground. It's gonna be torn down now <endOfText>
<human> Don't it always seem to goooo That you don't know what you've got til its gone... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather is really nice today for once. Feels good. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it's been crazy hot lately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy from college was just down recently, we got to talking about fun times back then. <endOfText>
<human> It's always fun to remember the fun (and sometimes wild) times from college with a friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried I won't pass my chemistry test. I studied really hard but am afraid I won't know all the answers. <endOfText>
<human> im sure you will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my car washed and the worker there stole money out of my car. <endOfText>
<human> did he get a beat down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i couldnt go to my sons game <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you missed it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am drug addict. Once I robbed my parents because of my addiction. When I think about it, I feel terrible bad. <endOfText>
<human> That is a terrible thing but your situation has an toll on you have you considered getting help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 90s music always takes me back to better and easier times. <endOfText>
<human> 90s music was great.  Do you have a favorite band or song? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing some cleaning and I some stuff that reminded me of when I thought I was going to be a millionare <endOfText>
<human> Were they lottery and scratch off tickets? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive seeing a guy eat a 3 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> Woah!  Bet he was digesting for days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sad when  I use a clever one-liner from old pop lyrics...and it goes right over people's heads..waste of genius really <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is truly tragic. People dont appreciate the older novelties <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is always bugging me to do things that I dont have time to do. Yesterday they wanted me to stop my work day, come home, and go to the old folks home to visit my grandma when i already go every weekend. Its like they think that my work doesn't matter and I can just up and leave whenever? <endOfText>
<human> I could be wrong...but I feel like they just miss your company...and are using your grandma as a scapegoat.  Don't be so hard on them they're not always gonna be around  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could be wrong...but I feel like they just miss your company...and are using your grandma as a scapegoat.  Don't be so hard on them they're not always gonna be around ;) <endOfText>
<human> I spend every weekend with them, I just wish they could understand that I have a life even if it is just working and then working at home, sometimes I want to do what I want to do instead of what everyone else wants. Like. Leave me aloneee <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a wedding cake this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Do you make them for a living or as a hobby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My hamster passed away and I never thought I would be so upset. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been working 7 days a week for at least a month now. I'm burning out. <endOfText>
<human> wow how do you do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Taking my date to the amusement park this weekend. I think we'll have an amazing time. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a lot of fun! I'm sure it'll be a great date to bond. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i loved taking care of my sisters pet <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's sweet. What kind of pet is it? Did you wish you could steal it so it could be yours instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the cops are coming to my house tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our team made the best IT project in the university. <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool, what was the project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am packed a week ahead of time for my vacation, it's freeing! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so excited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole a sandwich from one of my students. <endOfText>
<human> How did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents raised me like a king and I'm thankful for that.  Because although I was introverted for most of my life I was pretty confident and successful in my abilities and always did well no matter what I did <endOfText>
<human> That is so wonderful that you give your parents the credit and are so grateful for what they did for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have so many ants in my kitchen, no matter what I do, I can't get rid of them and they are everywhere. <endOfText>
<human> You must cook a lot of tasty food all the time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not do anything over the weekend and I was okay with it. I just got to relax <endOfText>
<human> yea thats true <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone asked me what the word belligerent meant the other day, and I knew the answer. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. How did you know what that meant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to get this baby out! I feel like I've been pregnant forever <endOfText>
<human> I remember my wife saying that when she was pregnant with both of ours.  How far along are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 36 weeks.. almost there lol <endOfText>
<human> That is a very long time.  Is this your first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am repulsed by my neighbor. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh I've been there before... What do they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was ready for that interview last week <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone stole money from my account and my bank won't help me, I can't believe this! <endOfText>
<human> same thing happened to me.. i believe it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> same thing happened to me.. i believe it <endOfText>
<human> It's ridiculous! You think they would be a little more helpful when money is on the line! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is going to across the country. I miss seeing her almost everyday <endOfText>
<human> is she coming back ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope i win the lottery <endOfText>
<human> That would be awesome. What would you do with the winnings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Women in this part of Texas must be deprived of outsiders...because I get sideways stares from all the Latina ladies when I walk into any gym, bar, or supermarket and it trips me out <endOfText>
<human> They're checking you out or they're glaring at you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my son is turning 4 tomorrow. He was just a sweet, chubby baby a minute ago. <endOfText>
<human> 4 is still a baby for me...but i'd start treating him like a man <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just bought a new car, it's a Honda Civic and it's red. <endOfText>
<human> I love hondas.  Are you jealous of that person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a cheesecake later. <endOfText>
<human> Is it for a special event? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked through a spider web accidentally while I was sweeping my porch. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Was it big? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend changed carerr in her 40s and turns to be the best decision of her life <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, she sounds multi faceted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a blind date this weekend. I've never even been on a date <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds exciting and anxiety-inducing at the same time, hope it turns out well for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm meeting my online girlfriend for the first time this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's a huge step. Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been waiting for my husband to build my new furniture and he's taking forever! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I'm impressed he can make furniture! Is he busy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I would've checked my bank account before going on last night's date <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did you overdraw your account? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a huge job promotion 4 months earlier than expected because I brought in so many new clients. <endOfText>
<human> Well, you definitely deserve it then! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am watching my friends dog tomorrow. She is going of town, I just love that dog <endOfText>
<human> You sound like a very good friend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my son's birthday ice cream cake. <endOfText>
<human> I love ice cream cake, did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but I feel so guilty for my behavior. <endOfText>
<human> Its just cake, there will always be another cake <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my mom. Can't believe I used to be so annoyed seeing her everyday when I was little <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, no one can get to you like your mom. But they are awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped near my bed right before I was going to sleep. <endOfText>
<human> Oh damn. Did you do something to upset your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know how chefs push out food so fast. I can barely get a meal done in under an hour. <endOfText>
<human> they got a ton of worker bees following their command <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was sad when i couldnt get the day off <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Will you get a day off soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have high hopes for this weekend. I think it might be sunny here <endOfText>
<human> Oh I get you. It's been raining here everyday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the street the other day and I felt something hit my head. I realized a bird had pooped on me! I was so shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Now that is one of the most unfortunate things I've heard all week. How did you get it out of your hair? Eeww <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My date ended up paying for our dinner. My card got denied <endOfText>
<human> Oohh...if you're the girl that's ok...if you're a guy c'mon buddy, bring some cash lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope to win the lottery this friday <endOfText>
<human> How much is the jackpot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get into my first choice school. <endOfText>
<human> you were too good for them anyway! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got my grades in from last semester and I got an A in every class! <endOfText>
<human> You must be a great student! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole a gift card from my friends house. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes. Why did you take it may I ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my friend canceled our trip last month, it really hurt me. I was looking forward to ti <endOfText>
<human> where were you all going to go ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home alone last night <endOfText>
<human> Why were you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe a girl asked me out <endOfText>
<human> Why are you surprised she asked you out?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why are you surprised she asked you out? <endOfText>
<human> I didn't know girls do those things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a year book from way back with me in school as a kid. I felt weird looking at it <endOfText>
<human> It is kind of odd to look at ourselves from that long ago, and we didn't even realize what we looked like usually at that time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was hoping to meet my friend this weekend that I hadn't seen in a long time, but he had to cancel suddenly. <endOfText>
<human> Why did they cancel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with myself. I made an A in every class last semester. <endOfText>
<human> Impressive! It is all going to be well worth it in the long run, keep going ghost rider! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke this morning to my cat literally on top of me with his face right in my face staring at me like he wanted something. I got up and saw that I did indeed forget to feed him last night. Little bugger thought he would catch me off guard. <endOfText>
<human> Haha. That would have scared me so much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my kimchi will win the best kimchi award at the kimchi contest <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hope it does! I bet you've got a super secret ingredient that makes it stand out from the rest of the rabble. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every other night at around the same time, I keep hearing a girl scream <endOfText>
<human> what does she say ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> oh no. this sounds bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was supposed to go camping this past weekend, but it ended up storming like crazy <endOfText>
<human> Oh, sometimes you just have to accept weather changing your plans. I am sure you can go another time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going for some hot pot this weekend <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a check in the mail from out of nowhere for 500 dollars. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's pretty amazing. How are you gonna spend it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate how it ended with my ex. I feel bad when I think about it <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took credit for an idea that wasn't mine at work. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a new job. I'm kinda nervous! <endOfText>
<human> why ? im sure you will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather has been irritating this week. I am tired of the rain <endOfText>
<human> Oh damn. Me too. What area are you in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This store I stopped going to because of the bad customer service is actually closing down after all these years <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy with that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I first lost a fight I was more humiliated that I lost than worried about the fact that I was temporarily blind in my left eye and my head was split open with glass pieces <endOfText>
<human> Omg that is awful. How long did it take to recover?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Omg that is awful. How long did it take to recover? <endOfText>
<human> A couple of months.  My pride a year lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for weeks from now. College football is starting <endOfText>
<human> I know, I can't wait either! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when people said hello and thank you. <endOfText>
<human> I guess people are way more rude these days arent they <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt bad when i couldnt get my daughter the gift she wanted <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's got to feel rough. It's not quite the same, but I've felt similarly when I couldn't get previous ex-girlfriends gifts during holidays or their birthdays or something. But I'm sure she knows you love her anyway. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter took her first step a few weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager asked me to work this evening. I had plans already set. I had to cancel them. <endOfText>
<human> You couldn't say no to working? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At first it hurt a lot to find out that my ex had moved on so quickly. But looking back it probably wasn't meant to be...and now I'm living my best life <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry it didn't work out. But happy to hear you are happy now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got water dripping from the ceiling under my new AC unit. <endOfText>
<human> That must be annoying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My electric bill was 350 dollars this month. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes. Mine was 210. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Somehow I allowed myself to be drug to the movies to take my daughter to see The Meg. <endOfText>
<human> It looks good. Should I save my money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made fried chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans and bisuits last night <endOfText>
<human> That sounds soooo good! I'm eating low-carb right now but I'm a pushover for good mashed potatoes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad about tomorrow. My team meeting has been pushed up on short notice <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling so down, I miss my family. I think it's time to go visit. <endOfText>
<human> I think it is, that might make you feel better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still feel bad about lying to my ex. I just wish it could have ended better <endOfText>
<human> That is tough. Was it a big lie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I did really well on my test the other day. Well, I failed it. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of test was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a woman blow her nose in to her shirt. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross! That must have been disgusting to see. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the new Super Smash Brothers game to be released. <endOfText>
<human> Is that a video game?  Is it Mario? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sitting in traffic today due to a wreck and I saw the stupidest thing ever. <endOfText>
<human> What exactly did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't pay for all my groceries and someone came up from the line behind me and paid for the rest. I was so touched! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how amazing is that!? I wish someone would do that for me! I mean, I don't think I buy more than $30 of groceries at a time since it's just me, but still! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather tomorrow has me down. Its going to rain and I wanted to go hikinh <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks! Maybe you can go the next day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got mugged on vacation last year. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow! that is horrible!! did they get away with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to a team meeting in the morning. I am unsure what to expect <endOfText>
<human> Oh, Do you think you did something wrong?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, Do you think you did something wrong? <endOfText>
<human> No, it just came out of the blue, I never know what to expect really <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a planner.  I had planned a big getaway today.  Only after I arrived did I realize I had made a huge mistake! <endOfText>
<human> Where did you go and what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to take off work tomorrow to wait on a repair man to come to my house. <endOfText>
<human> What are they coming to fix? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY kids are back on school time. Everyone is asleep! <endOfText>
<human> Woohooo... I bet you're ecstatic <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until my daughter is old enough to go to school lol <endOfText>
<human> IT will be bittersweet. Trust me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been so happy lately, everything seems to finally be falling into place <endOfText>
<human> That's great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family used to go apple picking every year when I was young so now I'm starting that tradition with my young kids. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a neat tradition. What did you guys do with the apples once they were all picked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My folks got me a brand new car today. I was so stoked and shocked that they would do such a thing! <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing!  I'm so happy for you!  What kind of car did they get you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to put a computer together. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! How long do you think it will take you to build it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently moved to a new city to start a new job. I've been so busy I haven't been able to make any new friends here and no one I know lives here either. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I know that feeling well. My family moved around a ton while I was in grade school, so I don't really have many long term friends. Don't worry though, you'll make friends at your new job so easily, you won't even remember you didn't have friends! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a date tonight. I was a little upset with how it turned out <endOfText>
<human> That bad huh? what was wrong with'em <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband passed away last year and with my kids out of the house, its often eerily quiet. <endOfText>
<human> That does sound lonely. Do you have friends to turn to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the other day at work I was walking to the kitchen and tripped and fell. A bunch of people saw. I felt like an idiot. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Are you hurt?  Don't even worry about them. It happens to the best of us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so afraid of going on my first rollercoaster when I was a wee lad. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! I am still too scared to ride one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy to have my best friend. He always checks up on me <endOfText>
<human> That's really sweet of him. How long have you been friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to go out to dinner with my family tonight, but the restaurant was closed down <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's too bad. What kind of restaurant was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My armadillo passed away today...RIP Adolph. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Adolph must've had a happy life though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just lost my grandfather a month ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's really sad. Were you close to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been practicing for the interview tomorrow that all this week. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like a big opportunity for you.  Are you ready for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors drive me crazy and they're so weird. The bring huge Cloud chairs onto their tiny front stoop and lay back side by side together. It looks like they might fall off if they move at all. <endOfText>
<human> What in the world. Are they doing drugs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been practicing all week for the interview I have tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Oh you've definitely done your part to prepare. Good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old high school uniform at my parents house. It really brought me back to those fun times. <endOfText>
<human> I love reminiscing like that, I hope they were all good memories! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if you have a group like this, but I've got a group of lady friends that I get together with about once a week. <endOfText>
<human> That seems really nice actually. I do have a few close female friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone took my car stereo from my truck. <endOfText>
<human> On no! Did you report it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend so hard in her company. She got promoted to VP <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, It's nice to have friends that are role models <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i see  people leave their parents in oldage home. I get furious <endOfText>
<human> Why does that bother you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry that my water heater broke. <endOfText>
<human> ah thats so bad!! did you fix it yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maroon 5 songs remind me of my high school dances and hot girls I was too chicken too talk to at the time hahaha <endOfText>
<human> Well dang man. It's never too late! Just hit her up on the ole Facebook! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug last night. I was so mad at that little imp! <endOfText>
<human> awww sorry bout your rug...there's a facebook group called doggo you should follow...owners post pics of their dogs with signs around their necks like "I like jumping out of moving cars just to poop in front of strangers" you might be less mad looking at them haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am Looking for to get a good hike this in the company <endOfText>
<human> what does that mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to sign my daughters tuition check. <endOfText>
<human> oh how did you miss that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to replace the engine in my car. <endOfText>
<human> Oh what happened? Did your car break down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for work tomorrow and my team meeting. I have been working on it all night <endOfText>
<human> That's really great to hear. It's always good to prepare for big events like that. What's the meeting about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been studying for my math final all this week. I am going to knock it out of the park! <endOfText>
<human> That is great to hear. Are you good at math? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is getting a new truck that I kind of wanted. Its making me feel envious <endOfText>
<human> Right, sometimes I feel the same way when I feel like I should have something, but then I realize I would get bored from it after a while like everything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has such a beautiful wife. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh. Good for him. Some guys are born lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month I saved my dog. He fell in the river and was drowning <endOfText>
<human> You are so brave to do that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love dogs as well. They truly are man's best friend. <endOfText>
<human> ive had one dogg that I love, but since she did its been hard to love again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> every time i give a knew speak im getting better and better. <endOfText>
<human> Engaging in conversation, whether the spoken or written word helps to further communication along. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is so luck. We both bought some scratch off tickets and he won $100. I didnt win anything. <endOfText>
<human> Did he at least take you out to lunch with the winnings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not eve. I really wish it were me that won. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you will win next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when someone dosnt take the hint and will not stop talking <endOfText>
<human> I agree. That is rude and annoying. How do you handle it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends threw me a surprise birthday party and gave me a Ferrari. I was so stunned! <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow! I think I would have passed out if I was you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost drove off without my phone at the gas station. I felt ashamed <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm glad you got it! Did someone call out for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a good job, my cat and lots of books. I am pretty happy <endOfText>
<human> I would be happy too if I had that. What kind of cat do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat came into my life just as my dog was declining in health <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very fortunate. Good timing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Spent an hour making this pizza. Now waiting for it to bake <endOfText>
<human> Boy, what I would do for a slice o that right now. What kind of pizza is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran over a bloated, dead possum today. I was so nasty! <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Well, at least it died nice and full. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my cat likes to eat food with rabbit meat <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, cat does like that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My goldfish took his journey into the afterlife today. I was so traumatized. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man. Did you get a chance to say goodbye? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to cooking school to become a chef. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty cool. Maybe you could toss me a few recipes for recently deceased goldfish? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking in the rain and I fell in a muddy puddle. <endOfText>
<human> On no! Did you get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Europe last year, to watch a cricket match. <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting! I have no idea how that sport is even played, but I'm glad you go to go see it! Did the team you were rooting for win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't call my mom back the other day even though I said I would...I feel kinda bad. <endOfText>
<human> Well, you can call her today and make up for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have since talked to her! So everything is good. But yeah I just felt kind of bad for lying. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you lie to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to set at dinner with a girl who I thought was my girlfriend. My girlfriend saw the whole thing. <endOfText>
<human> Wow how did that happen??  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow how did that happen?? <endOfText>
<human> She looked a lot like my girlfriend from the back. Guess I was super tired, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my crush likes me. I'm gonna ask her out tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> You should do it.  I think you'll do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my girlfriend broke up today. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Why did it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I swallowed a fly today on the way home from work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross, did you spit it back out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm upset I didn't get the promotion at work I wanted <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, my friend. Is there a chance to get it in the near future? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i dont like my new neighbors <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I hate that!  What are they doing to irritate you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got this big tote of photos that need to be organized.  But I can only seem to work on it for a few minutes at a time unfortunately. <endOfText>
<human> Thats going to take forever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my first acupuncture appointment tomorrow and do not know what to expect.  The idea of someone stabbing me with needles for an hour seems stressful <endOfText>
<human> hm is there a reason you are going? have you been experiencing chronic pain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just me and my cat living the life <endOfText>
<human> Pets are great companions.  Mine follow me around everywhere and I am sure you cat does the same thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There's this Japanese restaurant I keep passing on my way to work. I'm finally going to check it out this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? Was it any good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy with my life right now, I don't know if I want to add kids to it <endOfText>
<human> well that is def a big decision to consider <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for my new car to be delivered to me tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting! What car did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is the best <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's so sweet. Why would you say such a thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went skydiving today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh sounds exciting! How'd it go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year, my brother gave a speech on independence day <endOfText>
<human> Oh what was it about? Was it for an event? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my 5 dollar ice cream as soon as I left the store <endOfText>
<human> Ohh that's bad. How did you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took money from my daughter's piggy bank. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you had a really good reason right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to buy some egg rolls from the store, but they no longer sell my favorite ones <endOfText>
<human> ah that's so sad. You would miss your favorite one. i think you need to find something else <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my mind and temper, when i have been told i won't be promoted <endOfText>
<human> That must've really upset you. Did they explain why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i was cleaning the basement. I found old video game which i used to play when i was young!! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What platform was it for? Nintendo or Atari or Sony? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like to ask my friends for advice <endOfText>
<human> thats nice of you to rely on a friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so over my sister in law, I have absolutely no use for her. <endOfText>
<human> Alright, I can get behind that. Sisters-in-law are usually angry messes of human beings anyway, so I'll back you up on that. What did she do though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never had a decent car <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. In all fairness, no one really needs a good car. I have a beater, but it's get me from place to place. That's all that really matters. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A strange man was staring at my girlfriend at the carnival today. I was so furious! <endOfText>
<human> did you say something <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been studying for my final math exam all week long. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do well on it! Do you feel prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like summer time and going to the beach <endOfText>
<human> I do too! Love going out and swimming in the ocean. Why do you like going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bowling alley all by myself today. It was terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Being alone or going bowling - or both? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got to get an MRI and I've been waiting for the appointment for almost 3 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, what are you getting that for? I hope everything is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> he give me a gift to me in unexpected time <endOfText>
<human> what was the gift ? i can imagine it was something wonderful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> was it colorful or did it play a tune ? <endOfText>
<human> yes it was colourful, we can play a many tunes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I entered my car, sat down, only to find ANTS coming out of my visor ! They were everywhere <endOfText>
<human> did you try clear it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I cry when I watch sad movies <endOfText>
<human> I can relate.  What's the saddest movie you've ever watched? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm scared that my neighbourhood is unsafe, there have been a lot of breakins <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Are the police doing anything about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, did it take long to clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking forward to presenting to my client, I spent a lot of time on that powerpoint <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will present a stellar product. What is the powerpoint on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait for my new show to come back on its my favorite <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What is the name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The time of year makes me miss being a kid watching football with my dad. I do miss him <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Do you have any friends or other family that you can do that with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mr dog pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Thats gross. Did you punish the dog at all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> Really? What was his first word? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is the greatest person in my life. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great to hear. I love my wife too. What does she do that make you appreciate her every day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister sent me a letter from france. I had not heard from her in awhile and I did not even know she was on vacation <endOfText>
<human> Ah that must have been surprise for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When i see old people on roadside begging. i  have tears in my eyes. <endOfText>
<human> I do feel bad for them as well, its tough to see <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going sky diving this Sunday but I am a little scared <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's amazing! I'm insanely jealous! I think it's pretty normal to be scared of that though. After all, it wouldn't be nearly as much fun if it didn't terrify you, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran over a dead deer today. It was pretty gross. <endOfText>
<human> ah thats really gross!!. I hate it road authority do not clear dead animals from the roads asap <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a new house and i will register it this monday <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Is it your first time buying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on my new chaise rug today. <endOfText>
<human> OMG. I think I would have passed out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was my favorite co workers last day, I'm going to miss her <endOfText>
<human> ah thats so sad. why did she is leaving her though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was completely devastated when i heard my father died in car accident <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I'm so sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview last week that I thought I did really good on <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Did you get the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. I was so peeved! <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens and I dont even have a dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was weight lifting at the gym today and I accidentally farted. I'm pretty sure some attractive girls nearby heard me... I don't want to go back now. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry.  It happens to all of us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend has the nicest house I have ever seen. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah? Is it decorated well or just very large? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like it when kids bully each other <endOfText>
<human> I feel the same way. I never thought kids could be that mean! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am such a failure, I didnt even climb to the top of the ladder <endOfText>
<human> What kind of ladder was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a little envious of my brother in a good way. He is getting married to his best friend <endOfText>
<human> thats amazing, and also i would be a little envious, I just want love. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ran away today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  hav you been out looking for her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I use my new CD player it randomly skips. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Maybe you should get a new one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad for canceling on my friend tonight. I just did not feel like going anywhere <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you want to go anywhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking home at night. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, what happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been hard at work studying for my math final all this week. <endOfText>
<human> have you taken the test yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't; it's tomorrow! But I am sure I am going to knock it out of the park. <endOfText>
<human> if you studied really hard then you should <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final physics exam tomorrow and have been studying for it all week. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck with that. Are you well prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out to a bar with a guy that I have met in a party. This guy was so cheap that he was asking the barman if he can bring his drinkings from home. <endOfText>
<human> I would do that too. It's a waste of money if you don't finish it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't pay my taxes this year. <endOfText>
<human> On no. Did you get a letter from the IRS? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat pooped on the rug today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! What a smelly situation. Were you able to clean it up and get the smell out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally locked my keys in my car recently. Luckily my friend was able to bring me my spare keys! <endOfText>
<human> That's such an awful feeling! I at least do it twice a year -_- <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole some candy from the store yesterday and now I can't sleep at night. <endOfText>
<human> Hmmm, maybe that's because you ate it and you've got a sugar rush. I wouldn't worry! That usually fades in a couple hours.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hmmm, maybe that's because you ate it and you've got a sugar rush. I wouldn't worry! That usually fades in a couple hours. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so. I've never stolen anything in my life. I feel somewhat bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My upstairs neighbors had a huge party last weekend and were playing music until 5am. <endOfText>
<human> I really hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> there was trash all over the parking lot this morning <endOfText>
<human> No way, that's gross. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 12 Big Macs last night. I felt kinda bad about it while I stared at a group of homeless folks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Do you think you might get sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister called after years. We never talked due to some big fight between us. I was pleasantly surprised when i got her call !! <endOfText>
<human> thats nice family should not fight forever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out my friend took her ex boyfriend back <endOfText>
<human> You must be happy for her!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother in law does not know how to mind her business, I don't understand why she has to be so undermining to us. <endOfText>
<human> What a jerk! Why is she always in your biz? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate 20 pizzas today. I've never felt so disgusted with myself. <endOfText>
<human> 20 pizzas!!!  How did you fit that in your stomach without it exploding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having a rough relationship lately, so tomorrow I plan to break up with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no... I hope it's for the best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I ate so much pizza today... there goes my diet <endOfText>
<human> It's okay to have cheat days sometimes! Start again tomorrow! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went rock climbing the yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That is interesting. Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having panic attacks at work lately.  I'm supposed to go see the dr tomorrow about them. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you can get treated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally passed gas in front of my mother in law. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did she say anything about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She told me I'm a disgrace. I felt so humiliated. <endOfText>
<human> I think that as a bit harsh!  It wasn't like you did it on purpose thinking it would be funny or anything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let out the noisiest, moistest, and smelliest fart in front of all my co-workers the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, did that bother your co-workers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through my old school yearbooks. It had been awhile since I saw them. It really brought back a lot of memories <endOfText>
<human> Ah, I certainly know the feeling of bringing back old memories. It's fun to go back and remember the people you shared all those classes with, isn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very happy with my boyfriends' cooking skills, he's definitely improving <endOfText>
<human> Awesome. Is he learning to cook for the first time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Game of Thrones only has one season left <endOfText>
<human> Is that a favorite of yours?  I've never watched it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  had to go shopping for a toy for my nephew's birthday and literally ended up crying in the Lego aisle. <endOfText>
<human> why what happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother always calls me to ask to borrow money. He doesn't even work, he's just lazy. <endOfText>
<human> What a jerk. Why doesn't he get a job at McDonalds? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was furious, my wife went into my bad and took my card! <endOfText>
<human> Credit card? That seems like an invasion of privacy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I'll have a song stuck in my head for hours <endOfText>
<human> Story of my everyday life. I swear I ear a jingle for hours <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran over a skunk yesterday. The smell was horrendous. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! You may have to wash your car to get that smell out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug yesterday. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In one of my classes at school someone was making fun of me. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Did you confront them about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so afraid of sleeping when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> How come? Were you scared you wouldn't wake up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sprain my ankle really often. I'm not great at basic walking <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Have you seen a doctor about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried to buy a part for my furniture but they changed the sizes and left the name the same <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty dumb. Did you eventually get the part? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped in my wig today. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How are you going to clean it out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to the store in my pajamas today <endOfText>
<human> Nice! How did that feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe my friend won the lottery <endOfText>
<human> wow how much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in McDonald's drive thru to place my food order. When I arrived home, I noticed they gave me the wrong order ! <endOfText>
<human> That's really annoying. Was the wrong order any good?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really annoying. Was the wrong order any good? <endOfText>
<human> It included a strawberry shake (I'm allergic to strawberries !) French Fries (I have high cholesterol) and a Coke (I am a diabetic) . Nothing good from my perspective ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hm.. judging from your conditions, maybe McDonald's isn't the best place for your to eat anyway! <endOfText>
<human> They do have healthy choice options. I originally ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and diet coke, and sliced apples :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My good friend has been overweight his whole life. Just yesterday he signed up for a gym membership! <endOfText>
<human> I think thats a positive thing. Motivation is the key. Do you think he'll follow through and actually attend the gym ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my friend planned to go hiking last Sunday morning. However, i overslept and the whole plan was blown away. So ashamed of myself <endOfText>
<human> On no. Dont be too hard on yourself. You must have needed the rest. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped in my shoe today. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> That's awful! Were you able to clean it off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today. My breast filled with pride as my ears were graced with that beautiful word. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's exciting! I think I would swell with pride if a swear word were my kid's first word too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I play tennis I think about my tournaments in high school <endOfText>
<human> Were you any good in high school or was it just fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My puppy graduated at the top of his training class! I was so happy to see that. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What breed is your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I listen to smashmouth I remember the 90s and Shrek <endOfText>
<human> Hey now, you're an all star! Did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey now, you're an all star! Did you know they wrote that song with the hopes of giving their fans more confidence? <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's really nice, yeah I love that song when I was young. It was really cute and upbeat <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the new SNES Classic system. It reminds me of when I first played SNES as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> How fun! I remember the good old days with those games you didn't need a monthly subscription to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cable bill is so high it's ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you change your provider? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor keep doing too much noise during the night. <endOfText>
<human> That must be annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Many of my friends go to medical school, they will be very successful in the future <endOfText>
<human> Well, they deserve it. Medical school is not easy and they spent unimaginable effort and hard work to finish it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my classmate shamelessly asked me to copy my homework and submit as his own. So disgusted at his behavior <endOfText>
<human> Well maybe he trusted you as a good friend, next time try to help him with his homework instead <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a presentation at work that I'm sure I'm going to do great! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you will! Did you make sure you took time working on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my best friend swore that she would be single forever <endOfText>
<human> Is she still single? Some people don't like to be in a relationship <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man put mayo in his milkshake. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that sounds horrifying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty happy with my local representatives, they represent my interests well <endOfText>
<human> You are lucky to have that in your community. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished another college semester and now waiting for grades to post. <endOfText>
<human> Thats the worst part, I just finished one aswell, ended up doing pretty well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked so hard to make it up to her and its wasnt enough for my wife <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. I am sorry. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasnt a good husband, and i was too demanding, I tried to make up p but it just wasnt enough <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry. At least you tried. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat pooped on the bed the other day, I threw away the sheet <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a pet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when people cut me off in traffic <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah me too. They can be so rude.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah me too. They can be so rude. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I think being a great driver means you pay attention to your own actions too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so alone in this life. Like no one could possible undertand me. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that feeling sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I threw away all my children's toys. <endOfText>
<human> whys that?? were they growing out of them/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love it when I get free samples at Costco <endOfText>
<human> I like that too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Donald Trump really disgust me as a person. <endOfText>
<human> But america is so great now! look at all the great things that are happening and are great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was raining earlier and lightning struck nearby and my power went out. Luckily it came back on a few minutes later but I was quite shocked at first! <endOfText>
<human> Really??? A power out does not sound that scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like people that take the HOA too seriously <endOfText>
<human> Why and what's HOA? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day I didn't have an umbrella when it was pouring rain. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get really wet? I hope you didn't catch a cold <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole 5 dollars when i was kid!! <endOfText>
<human> I think we all did lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its too quiet now the kids are back in school <endOfText>
<human> yeah may be kids changed nowadays!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> watching old western movies always reminds me of being a kid and staying with my grandparents <endOfText>
<human> Do you like old western movies <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to get a dog, but my cat would hate that <endOfText>
<human> Ah, new version of Tom and Jerry. You would  be thinking whether to get or not!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am having an operation and i hope it will go well <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too, what kind of operation is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live away from family. When ever i see kids on road. I think about mine <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's so sad, how often do you get to visit them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy with my cooking skills, I make great pasta <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I should visit you once for your great Pasta!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember playing house as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Fun, did you play with your siblings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stopped to get my morning drink on the way to work and didn't check it. They gave me the wrong order. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that's so disappointing when they do that. Starts off the whole day wrong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really want to look like those girls on instagram but it's not attainable <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. I feel the same sometimes but honestly it's not realistoc <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like that my boyfriend works with females at his job. <endOfText>
<human> How come? Do you not trust him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed my time in Tokyo, it was a great experience <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet! Did you just go on vacation?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I bet! Did you just go on vacation? <endOfText>
<human> Yes! The food was great and the culture is so interesting <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet the other day, I think I left it on a bus <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It couldnt be true, I know that wa my mom, but the man she was with wasnt my dad. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did you confront her about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've spent all day packing.. I think I'm ready for vacation! <endOfText>
<human> Yay! where are you going? are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm scared my dog will run away, he can't see very well <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's a shame. Is he a house dog or an outside one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I forgot my dad's birthday. I feel kinda bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well you can celebrate it a couple days late, it's fine <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my two dogs that live with my parents <endOfText>
<human> awwww..its tough leaving lifelong family pets <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i took my pharmacy certification exam today. i felt really good and prepared for it <endOfText>
<human> I hope you pass! You tried your best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled some coffee on my lap and now it looks like I wet myself. <endOfText>
<human> I have done that way too many times,  maybe use the air drter in the bathroom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I could have some company on my nightly walks. <endOfText>
<human> Do you just walk alone usually? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother has been there for me no mater what I need. <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like a good person. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I played dodge ball at summer camp one day. <endOfText>
<human> did you do good? or get smacked around alot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my dogs, I get to see them when I visit my parents <endOfText>
<human> How sweet. What breed is the dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some days I listen to sad music at work <endOfText>
<human> Really? Why do you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so blessed to be born in an area of the world without many major natural disasters. <endOfText>
<human> Me too, I am very lucky to have moved. I used to live in a place with a lot of earthquakes and hurricanes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If I ust believe it hard enough in my heart then its mine! <endOfText>
<human> That is a good way to think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to eat lunch by myself. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you go? did you enjoy yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not get the promotion this year. I feel little down <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am sorry to hear that. You will get another chance I am sure <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just realized that I don't have many friends here. <endOfText>
<human> oh why not!! quality is better than quantity!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After all of this training, I still cant use my leg <endOfText>
<human> Oh no my dear, what happened to your leg? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am attending a movie themed costume part this weekend. I bought my Darth Vader costume weekend in advance! <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. Socializing through such ways is a great way to enjoy your time. And besides, I am not Star Wars fan and have not watched any of the movie series <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Okay, I mainly prefer the original classic trilogy and am not a big fan of the never ones. But I'll so ready for the party and will hopefully be very impressive! <endOfText>
<human> Costume parties are very fun to attend. If i ever attend one, then i will go in iron man suit. I just love that character and its personality <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I consider myself a loyal Apple customer and seeing its recent break in $1 Trillion in stock market cap, just makes me feel great and proud of feeling attached to this company <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like you are a loyal customer! How did you feel about them taking your headphone jack from their cellphones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I dropped my phone on the way to going to buy a phone cover.... I hadn't even had it for more than 2 days <endOfText>
<human> oh my god, just your luck huh,  thats crazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost all my money in one of my bank accounts. <endOfText>
<human> WHAT HAPPENED?? DID YOU EVER GET IT BACK?!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked when a huge bat hit my window last night! <endOfText>
<human> Wow I bet you were surprised! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new restaurant down the street from me and WOW it was amazing. Totally wasn't expecting it <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! I love finding new places like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was visiting my friend's new place, and I felt so bad about spilling red wine while they weren't looking. <endOfText>
<human> Did you cover it up or tell them about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate an entire gallon tub of ice cream earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa! How are you feeling from it now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate an entire cheesecake to my face in one night <endOfText>
<human> Wow you were able to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> why is it everytime im up in life something brings me down <endOfText>
<human> Unfortunately, it happens to all of us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Applebee's for dinner tonight. <endOfText>
<human> What did you order?! was it delicious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If my friends hadnt picked me up, id still be at rock bottom! <endOfText>
<human> True friends can be tested at such situations. Good for you to have such friends. It is very rare to have such ones <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very disappointed at the way the political discourse in our country is going. The major parties are so openly hostile toward each other <endOfText>
<human> I agreee, and I see no point in it, This is all our country we are all one here, why fight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe how much dog poop i see around my apartment. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I caught my husband messaging another woman on facebook <endOfText>
<human> oh my god! did you confront him about it? <endOfText>

<human> OMG I'd be so upset. Did you confront him about it? <endOfText>

<human> I'd be livid! Some people just won't let us have nice things, I swear. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a job interview last week, and i felt like i knew i was going to get the job after i left <endOfText>
<human> that sounds great, I hope you get it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A storm came through earlier and scared my dog. He ran to me and I was quite shocked! He can be a 100 pound baby sometimes! <endOfText>
<human> oh no, were you able to calm him down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend dumped me last month. <endOfText>

<human> That sounds great, were you nervous about the interview? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog always listens to me whenever I call him or direct him to do something. He's a very good boy. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I just finished a very hard exam and I feel good about it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you did amazing, did you study hard for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought 10 tickets to win a new cars. I am hoping I'm lucky this time! <endOfText>
<human> That would be great! It would certainly save you from having to buy a new car for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was outside playing with my dogs earlier. We were throwing the ball around and I felt great! <endOfText>
<human> sounds super fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost cut me off today <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, I hate when that happens! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a guy on a dating app a few weeks ago and we're really hitting it off. <endOfText>
<human> That's good! Have  you met in person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new lasagna recipe and it turned out amazing! <endOfText>
<human> Really! That's awesome! Was there something new in it you don't usually use? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like getting drunk, especially like tonight when I get drunk with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> It can be a fun thing as long as one doesn't go overboard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going out to a picnic like thing with some friends next weekend. Fingers crossed the weather stays nice. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really relaxing and nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I snapped at a customer today.. but they were being so rude <endOfText>
<human> its understandable, they are so annoying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got cut off today <endOfText>
<human> oh no im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I brought my car to the garage for a simple oil change last week. When I went to pick it up they had done $600 of repairs. I can't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> You can't believe they did it without asking or that the car needed the repairs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's supposed to storm more later this week. It's been hailing recently and I really need it to stop already! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's crazy. Is it very cold where you are living? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker is a good person. I am really appreciative that I can depend on them. <endOfText>
<human> thats quite nice of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my rug today <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hope your cat is feeling okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter won the spelling bee. All her hard work paid off! <endOfText>
<human> That's so impressive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really surprised by my friend since he never had any responsibilities and then he suddenly had tons. <endOfText>
<human> that must be so hard to deal with  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that must be so hard to deal with <endOfText>
<human> Not really, he was just so irresponsible before and then he got a job and a girlfriend too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bathroom and walked out with my skirt tucked into my underwear tonight and didn't notice. <endOfText>
<human> Wow did anyone let you at least know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had to send my food back at the resturaunt today <endOfText>
<human> thats really annoying to deal with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat died last week <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that. loss of a pet is tough <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been waiting to hear back from a job interview I feel went quite well. <endOfText>
<human> How long do you have to wait? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait until Friday to know if i got the promotion... the wait is killing me\ <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, how long has it been since you got last promoted? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a test this week and im scared ill do bad <endOfText>
<human> Are you prepared for it? Did you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a dental appointment for a root canal tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> sounds quite hard to deal with but good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really hate public speaking, so it doesn't help that I had to recite a poem in public way back in like 6th grade. <endOfText>
<human> I definitely understand that feeling.  It took me forever to sign up for my Speech Communications class because of speaking in public. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wished my dad would do the proper introductions and bring all of my siblings together. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean by that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared during the new shark movie. I had to look away several times! <endOfText>
<human> I hate shark movies too. That's why I refuse to swim in the ocean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked hard and finally got a promotion today! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That is great news to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend used to be such a nobody until he got a job and a girlfriend out of nowhere. <endOfText>
<human> Life can have some sudden turns. But these are very little chances to count on and hope for <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing a game recently and a reminded me of childhood. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of games? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was camping last weekend and I kept getting bitten by very big deer flies. It was so annoying! <endOfText>
<human> oof sounds so bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my pants dropped last week from getting hooked on a table <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that must have been embarrassing!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, that must have been embarrassing! <endOfText>
<human> yea i was so mad at myself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on my way home last night when a large speeding truck came flying under a red light as I passed under it. Damn near nailed me! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that must've been really scary! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend at the time seemed to be so much more passionate when talking to one of her friends. <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean exactly? She doesn't have the same passion when speaking to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost crashed into me today <endOfText>
<human> wow. are you ok? that can be really unnerving  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow. are you ok? that can be really unnerving <endOfText>
<human> yea i was so mad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a box of baby stuff from my twins that i have kept since they have been babies. they are 25 now <endOfText>
<human> thats very cute to do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sitting outside watching a storm arrive on my back porch I felt quite at ease with the world! <endOfText>
<human> I love watching heavy storms with thunder and lightening! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my rabbit died years back I was really upset. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible, I hate losing a pet... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really fun get together tonight with all of my coworkers and my boss. The night went fantastic! I'm feeling very happy and optimistic about life right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! It's such a good feeling working with people you actually like.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel good. Everything finally seems to be working out. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What are some things you're enjoying about life right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My younger 5 your old cousin was visiting last weekend for dinner and he kept crying to his mom to make him Kraft Dinner. <endOfText>
<human> Kids are sweet. They will do everything to get what they want. So, did her mom made him Kraft Dinner eventually? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner has some work related issues lately. I am trying to give her emotional support by taking her out just to distract her from work <endOfText>
<human> That's very nice of you. I hope she gets the issues sorted out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dropped my plate of food in the middle of the busy break room at work.... I wanted to disappear! <endOfText>
<human> that is terrible. nevermind being embarassed i would have been mad and hungry!!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was all of the above lol <endOfText>
<human> i dont blame you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is terrible. nevermind being embarassed i would have been mad and hungry!! <endOfText>
<human> I was all of the above lol  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im feeling positive that i got the job. it would really help me out a lot <endOfText>
<human> That's a good sign you did great then@ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went through the drive thru at a fast food place, and the cashier would not give me a receipt! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I would have asked for the manager! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I knew that my friends were going on a trip and I really wanted to go. <endOfText>
<human> Was there any reason you couldn't go? Did they not invite you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat vomited on my rug today <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, I hate when that happens. Do you think the cat ate something bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was pretty young, I witnessed my cousin fall and break her arm. It was completely disfigured and bent in odd ways. It grossed me out so bad I nearly vomitted. <endOfText>
<human> i bet it did i would be too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do not like being around rats, they scare me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah I hate rats too actually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Truth be told, I am quite afraid of snakes these days. <endOfText>
<human> I am not a fan of snaked either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is out of town for work. This sucks <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Must feel quite lonely for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was backing out of the parking lot at work and scratched my coworker's car a little bit. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you tell them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met this girl on Tinder one time and she gave me such mixed signals. <endOfText>
<human> haha, welcome to Tinder! It's the app of mixed signals. Did things work out finally? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched Friday the 13th for the first time tonight. I'm in my bed under the covers and don't think I can leave! <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, scary movies really terrify me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when I get accused of something that I didn't do at all. <endOfText>
<human> Same here, who accused you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad, my landlord is selling the house so I have to move. <endOfText>
<human> that is bad news. my mother is going through the same thing unfortunately. landlord became widowd and now is moving with her daughter in anothe state so will be selling the house <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my twins will be born tomorrow morning! i wont be able to sleep tonight <endOfText>
<human> Double the fun, are these your first children? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know that I will be the youngest billionaire ever. <endOfText>
<human> You sound very confident! how will you make that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you noticed the trends with engagement proposals and save the date YouTube videos?  I find them to be so romantic. <endOfText>
<human> I have not seen those but that sounds cute. Are you married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No and have no intentions of getting married.  However, I don't have any problems with celebrating with those who make that choice. <endOfText>
<human> Yep there's nothing wrong with either of those things! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A storm came through earlier and lightning struck very close by and the power went out! I was worried as sometimes the power can go out for days but luckily it came back on an hour later this time. <endOfText>
<human> I hate those kind of storms for good reasons.  We have lightning storms all the time in Georgia.  The power is more than likely to go out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got all A's on his report card. I was blown away. <endOfText>
<human> thats so cool, nice job of him' <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend got promoted at reasors <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great news! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for the weekend, I get to drive a NASCAR. <endOfText>
<human> Really? That's insane! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met this one girl on Tinder before knowing she was gonna lead me on. <endOfText>
<human> I do not like Tinder. What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got invited to a party in a shady part of town but I went anyway. <endOfText>
<human> That could have been a scary situation. How was the party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at myself, I made my team lose the softball game. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Don't blame yourself. It happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a chance of storms tomorrow and I hope we don't get anymore as we have been close to having floods recently! <endOfText>
<human> thats a fair point <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i studied for days when i had a math test <endOfText>
<human> That's great, how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I could singer better, like Michael Jackson. <endOfText>
<human> that would be cool. do you have singing experience ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i didnt think i was going to be able to take my pharmacy tech certification test. the fee was $350.. <endOfText>
<human> Did you figure out a way to pay it thou? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so bad when I got home from work because I saw a huge mustard stain on my shirt! <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's the worst, especially when the clothes are new! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was quite the nobody until he got a job and a girlfriend seemingly out of nowhere! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's good for him. What do you think changed for him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend used to be such a nobody until he got a job and girlfriend out of nowhere! <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy for him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pray that America will be great again. <endOfText>
<human> why do you say that? are you worried about the current state of affairs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother is in the hospital after being in a car accident. The doctors are taking good care of her so I feel she is in good hands. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that about your grandmother.  I'm close to my grandmother so I would definitely need for the doctors to provide the best of care.  I'm sure you are looking for a speedy recovery. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I swear as I get older I need to take my time in getting dress. I'm afraid I'm going to be on one of those Walmart meme.  I've left home and before you know it I realize I have something on wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I always like to pick out what I'm wearing the night before. Maybe that would help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really could help. I heard Einstein used to wear the same clothes everyday because it would help him stay focused on his studies! <endOfText>
<human> That's interesting.  I usually don't have too much issues getting dressed.  Just on very rare occasions, I have left home with 2 different pairs of shoes, but at least on the right feet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am embarrassed that I skipped school to go to the concert. <endOfText>
<human> eh its worth it tho <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend helped me move the other day <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of them, did you pay them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got my dad's birthday present. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was the one who stole the painting from the museum. <endOfText>
<human> Why would you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner took my car last Sunday morning to visit her friend. She did not even ask me or let me know. I had plans too with friends. And I was stuck at home <endOfText>
<human> Wow that doesn't sound like a very good relationship. Did you talk to her about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently was worried about a job interview even though I think it went well. I hope I get it. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you. I had couple of interviews couple of years ago. Was very nervous, but thankfully they all went well. My advice, just try to hide your nervousness and show confidence <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother moved out of the apartment and it now feels really empty <endOfText>
<human> thats understabled i get it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost killed me the other day <endOfText>
<human> what?!?! how? what happend if you dont mind me asking <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cried the night I found out my girlfriend moved. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did she move away from your city? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my nephew's high school graduation. <endOfText>
<human> You must of been so proud of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At one point last semester, I realized I really needed a B in one my classes to get the GPA I wanted! <endOfText>
<human> Did you get the B? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so angry I didn't win my school election. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks. What role were you applying for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friends used to do so bad in school until he turned his GPA around out of nowhere! <endOfText>
<human> How did he do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really love supporting the New York Yankees. <endOfText>
<human> I'm not that into sports. What do you like about them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother died, my heart is in pieces. <endOfText>
<human> Aww.. I am so sorry for your loss. It is so hard to lose our loved ones.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww.. I am so sorry for your loss. It is so hard to lose our loved ones. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, he was my only brother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost killed me the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What had happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my car to the dealership to get it inspected and checked overall for a road trip. <endOfText>
<human> thats smart of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like the new stadium my school built. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great, it's always nice to have a new place to play like that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing with my cat earlier with a laser pointer and he was having such a great time! <endOfText>
<human> How long dd you do that for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a new girl and have a date with her tomorrow night. I have a lot of butterflies in my stomach right now! <endOfText>
<human> Where did you meet her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always keep my word to my children. <endOfText>
<human> That's always a good idea. I respect that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is in the Navy. <endOfText>
<human> How long has he been in the Navy?  I have a bonus son (my son's best friend) who has been in the Navy for about a year now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have a favorite music era? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I love 80s rock n roll. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Anytime I hear Hillary Clinton talk, I feel sick to my stomach. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, tell me about it. Her and Trump both make me feel that way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've long been married and living on my own, but my mom still cooks up delicious meals almost every night and invites me over to eat. I appreciate that more than she realizes. <endOfText>
<human> Does she come over every day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted to get an A in one of my classes but I barely didn't which is fine. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure a B or A- is just as good.  Which class was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won the lottery, its party time. <endOfText>
<human> That's so lucky! How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met this girl on Tinder and even though we didn't go the distance we really hit it off at first. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to see her again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a gigantic spider in my shower! <endOfText>
<human> wow i would be so sad if i saw that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost killed me the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh god, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I buy scratch tickets pretty often from a gas station near by, but I never really win anything more than a buck or two. Well, I won $500 yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. That is very good luck you had. To be honest, i am not really interested in those scratch tickets as i think they are just waste of my hard earned money <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently applied for a new credit card with Chase. My application was approved and i was given $8,400 credit line. To be honest, with my low credit score, i was pretty surprised to be given this amount <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow, that's a large limit! And I thought my $2500 limit was decent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my boxing match. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's pretty impressive! Have you been training a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friends seemed so bad with women but then randomly he  got a girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Where did he meet her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really want all the kids I teach to go on to big things in life. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too! So are you a teacher or substitute or what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at this guy's place and even though I didn't like him, I felt bad for stealing from him. <endOfText>
<human> What did you steal from him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I was as cool as Brad Pitt. <endOfText>
<human> Same, especially being as attractive as he is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sad about the bridge collapsing. <endOfText>
<human> Where and when did this happen?  I haven't looked at the news lately to avoid hearing sad news.  The last incident of the duck boat accident was very saddening. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish they would do more in the schools to stop children from being intimidated by others so they can focus on what's important. <endOfText>
<human> I think kids should all be home schooled. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure about all, but I do see a rise in those being home schooled to ensure the safety of the children.  However, not all parents are equipped with the ability to home school. <endOfText>
<human> They can hire teachers to come to the house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new taco place in town yesterday and I really liked it! <endOfText>
<human> I love tacos! Do they serve other mexican food? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 13 year old golden lab passed away this morning. I miss him so much, but I'm glad he is not in pain anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, will you get another dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Anytime I go to Mcdonald's I never order and feel sick. <endOfText>
<human> That's non fun. I'm sorry to heard that. Maybe you shouldn't go there anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really get mad when my taxes are raised. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. It's tough when unexpected things like that happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this last piece of cake that I was eyeballing, but my husband ate it! <endOfText>
<human> Did you tell him you wanted it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will win Gold in the Olympics. <endOfText>
<human> You sound very confident! What sport do you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am amazed that no one died in the plane crash. <endOfText>
<human> What plane crash are you referring to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co worker is always sucking up to the boss and doing good work. I think he is trying to get promoted. <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you do the same thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's feel so strange going from a household of 8 and now down to 5 with 2 almost ready to leave.  My youngest just started high school. I imagine 4 more years and it will be just me. <endOfText>
<human> Won't you enjoy less chaos? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really don't like it when people talk on the phone when at the movies. <endOfText>
<human> Have you ever talked on the phone at movies yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a little shocked when a storm came through recently a it hailed and damaged my vehicle a little! Luckily I have insurance at least.. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful! What kind of car do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm supposed to cook dinner tonight but I have no idea what to cook. <endOfText>
<human> Make a pizza, it is a fail safe choice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a victim of a hit-and-run accident! I got hit the other day and the car just drove off! <endOfText>
<human> Did you get hurt or just your car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my favorite show tv is being canceled ! i already hate the idea if it :( <endOfText>
<human> I hope it's not Game of Thorns?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When taking the leash off my dog and he responds to all my commands and sticks with me everywhere we go. He's a good boy! <endOfText>
<human> That is a well trained dog, how did you get it to respond like that.? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She found someone else <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, that sounds bad.  Is it your wife? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing a game recently and it reminded me of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> those are always good memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bird crashed right into my window today. <endOfText>
<human> what kind, is she alive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving and saw this guy dumping garbage on the side of the freeway. <endOfText>
<human> Did you threw it back into his car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother moved out of state 6 months ago for work and randomly showed up yesterday at my moms house, unannounced for a visit! <endOfText>
<human> were you happy to see him after that long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really into giving and receiving good customer service.  It's something about excellent customer service that really makes a different in your day. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I think people that work these jobs should call in sick when they are not in a mood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to watch a film this weekend, but I am not sure if I will like it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up reading any reviews on it first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to the store today, and when i got back to my car i realized i didnt pay for 2  12packs of soda <endOfText>
<human> Did you go back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend unexpectedly gave me a gift the other day. I was very appreciative of their gesture. <endOfText>
<human> Great, for what store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did not get to go to out with my friends last night <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We separated and she now  remarried <endOfText>
<human> were you shocked it happened so fast? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was full of surprise <endOfText>
<human> best to block her in every way so you don't hear about her life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went backpacking a week ago <endOfText>
<human> Cool, where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy to get home that day. <endOfText>
<human> I love coming home too.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love coming home too. <endOfText>
<human> What is your favourite thing about your home ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did my professional certification <endOfText>
<human> really? what was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cyber security <endOfText>
<human> that sounds so interesting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so trying to find a creative way to make my son remember to take out the trash.  I'm wondering if it's just a man thing, a generational thing because I remember hearing my grandmother and my mom fuss about it.  Now it is my turn and I'm so over it. <endOfText>
<human> If your son is very young and you give him an allowance then tie it to that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, he's 20 almost 21 now and I thought that as he grew older it would become automatic.  I don't want his potential wife to be frustrated by what should be automatic. <endOfText>
<human> Haha sadly it does not. I still hold off on doing it in my own apartment at 26. Unless they are very young I don't think here really is a good way unless it smells <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> can you imagine how that made me feel <endOfText>
<human> how what made you feel? do tell <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i moved into a new apartment yesterday. and while i was alseep last night i thought someone was breaking in..heard a lot of noise on my window <endOfText>
<human> man what happened next, i would have been looking for a place to hide <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss has been giving me hours I really want lately. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like your job is going well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So when I was younger, my aunt lived in California. We lived on the East Coast. My aunt invited my sister out to see her. <endOfText>
<human> That's great for your sister, but you must have felt left out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my kids conert was comping up so i bought the booklet of her play right before i went to the show <endOfText>
<human> What instrument do they yplay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I left the office only to find that my car had a flat tire in the parking lot. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! You must have been pretty frustrated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I have a vacation coming up in a few months. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sitting by the door waiting on my Plumber to show up. He is late. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, i bet that is frustrating. Have you ever used him before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planned a trip to go to Hawaii But due to volcano eruptions i had to cancel. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer. Sorry to hear that but I am sure you can reschedule, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well it will be hard to reschedule at work. We only have limited vacation windows. Im so upset i wont get to go. <endOfText>
<human> I would be to if I were in your shoes.  I would be very disappointed too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating lunch with family the other day when my mom ordered a pasta that smelled and looked great. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, I love pasta.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awesome, I love pasta. <endOfText>
<human> I like it too, but I was surprised at hers because it made me want to change my order. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got drunk last night and texted my boss. <endOfText>
<human> Lol that sounds wild, did you text them something appropriate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, I told him what was wrong with his management style. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully he can take constructive criticism, I think more people should be open to that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I locked my keys in the car and didnt have a spare one. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily there was a police officer near by and he helped me get it unlocked i was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Saved you the money from having to call pop a lock. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little boy started Kindegarten today and I already feel all alone. <endOfText>
<human> Awww how sweet. is he your only child? It does get easier.... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt the same way when my youngest started school. They grow up so fast. <endOfText>
<human> Yes they do. In a way I'm grateful because it is peaceful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My manager is wasting my time with stuff that is not related with work. I can not make progress in my work. <endOfText>
<human> I just cannot understand why people won't do their job properly, I had to cut my lunch break in order to do more work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was helping my sister to look for her card, even though I knew she wasn't going to find it <endOfText>
<human> That is nice from you. What card is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son ran over my neighbor's cat on accident the other day. He's only 16, learning to drive still. I think my neighbor is going to try to get physically abusive with him. Not sure what to do <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that sounds unfortunate. Is there no way to ask the neighbor to take it easy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom made a chocolate cake the other day and it reminded me of the one I had at my 8th birthday party. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, good on her. I bet she knew exactly how it would make you feel, too. Things people do personally themselves always have the better result. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really tired of the person in my life continuing to repeat the same mistakes. <endOfText>
<human> I know that feeling, so frustrating!  Do you think there's a chance the person will change? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was overcharged on my water bill by 200%, during a time I was on an especially tight budget. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god..They do that to me TOO! And we have poison water! Are they going to fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really sick of going through the same thing with a person who is in my life. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Do you have a plan to change things? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really excited to see that an ex coworker of mine moved back to town as was working with me once again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is nice! Why did they move back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently changed jobs for a better opportunity with more pay. I'm very pleased with the new job, but I did feel bummed about leaving my former co-workers behind. We had a good time and I liked those kids. <endOfText>
<human> That happens sometimes but I'm sure you will make a lot of new friends in your new job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat jumped up on the mantle and destroyed my mothers old vase. I am so distraught because that vase is over 50 years old. <endOfText>
<human> Could it be fixed at all?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Could it be fixed at all? <endOfText>
<human> It broke apart into many pieces. Its been in the family for so long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was picked to be the next contestant on the reality show survivor <endOfText>
<human> Whoa that is awesome. I could never be on that show. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on what I though was a great job interview. They called today to tell me I did not get the job. Im a little bummed out. <endOfText>
<human> Just keep trying and you will eventually land something <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend has been talking to lots of girls lately. <endOfText>
<human> oh really? What kind of girls? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up and found my AC unit broke and I had water dripping from the ceiling. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How frustrating! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just recently posted on Facebook about a lavish vacation he is on. <endOfText>
<human> Good for him. So where did he go? I will make a guess. Is it Miami? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a summer class, I have successfully passed my Linear Algebra class. I am so happy and satisfied with my results so far <endOfText>
<human> That is great, do you have any other classes this summer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister had a heart attack recently. I didn't see it coming because this is her first. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awful! Is she changing her diet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad when I didn't take the trash out the other night! <endOfText>
<human> Were you drunk or tired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job tomorrow. I'm feeling really good about it. <endOfText>
<human> You are so lucky, and must be really excited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting a motorcycle tomorrow since I just finished my motorcycle endorsement class! I feel really good about hitting the road! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you already have a bike? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She was in the family for 18 years <endOfText>
<human> Who was in your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing my momma dogs newborn puppy grow everyday is sooo precious! <endOfText>
<human> Yes it has been too hot for too long <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I am so appreciative of how tight knit me and my friends are as a group. <endOfText>
<human> Good friends are invalueble. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up this morning and found my truck had a flat tire. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a slow leak or was it somethign else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet the other day. i was very upset. I didn't even expect to find it but i got a call this morning and some old man told me he found it and he wants to return it to me! My faith in humanity is restored <endOfText>
<human> That's great news! I find most people are good, honest folk. It's the few rotten ones that make us forget that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that's true! I'm going to meet this man today after work and i will definitely give him a small gift <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of you. As I said, most people are very nice. You at least now have peace of mind. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't slept in 3 days, yet don't feel tired. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, Did you see a doctor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting ready for my mid year work review. <endOfText>
<human> Do you expect it to be positive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so relaxed right now. My daughter is asleep and my son is at school. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, are you going to have a nap? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I will meet my sales quota this month. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Do you get a bonus? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished a semester of college. I can't wait to get my grades. <endOfText>
<human> That must be such a relief to get another semester behind you. It's hard waiting to get your grades though I'm sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going through a lot right now. i usually don't like talking about it but i felt like i really need to talk it out. Yesterday my friend called me and i just started talking about everything. it felt good <endOfText>
<human> Well, it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, it is good you have a friend that is so close to you that you feel comfortable sharing with them. <endOfText>
<human> yes! i feel like we got closer to each other. i finally found somebody i can really trust <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner is being a big fat jerk. <endOfText>
<human> That's so annoying. Maybe you should leave earlier next time too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> feeling happy <endOfText>
<human> About what/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very positively surprised by the work made by a co-worker. <endOfText>
<human> Really?  What did they do to impress you so much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am finally getting to go to the Harry Potter attraction at Universal Studios! I love the movies and can hardly wait! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Did you watch all Harry Potter movies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent hours yesterday going through old photos from my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> did it bring a lot of memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell asleep at my friend's house and they shaved half my beard off of my face while I was sleeping. Now I look stupid and have to shave it all off! I've had one for the past 10 years. So stupid <endOfText>
<human> Well, that wasn't a very nice thing to do! Think of it as getting a new beard, rather than losing the old friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister threw a party for me a few months ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of her.  What was the occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a really nice house that he can barely afford. <endOfText>
<human> That must be stressful to your friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My bag split open at a coffee shop other day. Everything dropped loudly onto the floor. <endOfText>
<human> Omg that must have been really embarrassing. Did anyone came to your rescue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend gave me flowers and chocolate <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so nice! Was it a special occassion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did I tell you about the time I lost my wallet. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, you were just mentioning it. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so proud this morning when  my little boy got on the bus with no problems. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so wonderful! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was sick the other day and I made her soup. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you. What kind of soup. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my husband left yesterday on a work trip, and I miss him a lot more than I thought I would. <endOfText>
<human> Where did he go? Is he calling you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my cowokers is always talking to me about stuff that is not related to work. I can't make progress in my work. <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying. Have you talked to your boss about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been trying to lose weight for a while but I think I've finally gotten to where I can make lunches that are healthy but I still want to eat, and I don't feel like I'm starving literally all the time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is great! I have had great success doing keto and fasting for not feeling so hungry! Carbs and sugar do me in! What kind of lunches do you make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I found out I was betrayed..it was like being shot in the stomach...there is almost no worse feeling besides losing someone <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible! What happened to you? Who stabbed you in the back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I purchased a washer/dryer combo at and they came with dents. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I would be so angry!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset, I demanded a refund, which they refused to do. <endOfText>
<human> That's so wrong. Id speak to a supervisor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I would be so angry! <endOfText>
<human> I was so upset, I demanded a refund, which they refused to do.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently got to meet adam scott. He is one of my favorite actors. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I bet he was really surprised he got to meet him. What did he think of him in person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was flying back from Boston a couple weeks ago and there was some insane turbulence! I had never been so scared in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Oh god, I hate flying. I always seem to get the plane that ends up having some issue. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked around the mall for 2 hours with my fly down. <endOfText>
<human> Haha.. I'm sorry, that made me laugh a little bit. I do that sometimes too, and have no idea how I can forget so many times. I think at least if it happens, almost no one can really tell or notice, if that helps. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Over 20 years ago, when I was a cashier, I used to take money from the cash register and cover up my tracks. I was never caught. Sometimes I feel bad about it, other times I don't <endOfText>
<human> Did the company not pay you well enough? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened a corn on the cob and there were worms in it. I hate bugs. <endOfText>
<human> Gross. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just got accepted into the National Junior Honor society. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing! I bet she had to work hard for that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She has. She is such a serious student. I am very amazed at her hard work. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I think education is more important than ever <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law irritates me to no end.  I wish my husband would talk to her, but in their family the rule of law is "don't make waves".  It's ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, hopefully she naturally mellows out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew just said his first words last week. <endOfText>
<human> How exciting!  I remember when my girls said their first words!  What was his first word do you know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister graduated with a Master's degree <endOfText>
<human> wow, good for her! I'm sure she worked really hard to get a degree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes many sleepless nights. She is very deserving of that degree. <endOfText>
<human> i'm sure she will be able to find a really great job now ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my wife is so cranky today. she keeps complaining about every little thing! And it's my day off, so it's very annoying <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry that you have to go through that on your day off. Just try to be nice to her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend wants me to go to Thanksgiving at her parents this year, but I haven't even met them yet. <endOfText>
<human> I don't envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. It's nerve racking.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't envy you there. I have done the blind family meeting at a holiday dinner before. It's nerve racking. <endOfText>
<human> I feel a little nervous about it but my girlfriend doesn't understand.  She is starting to get irritated that I haven't given her my yes or no yet.  It is putting a strain on things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is in his last year of high school. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  Does he have any plans for what he's doing after high school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend, I am going to help my friend move to his new home. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What does his new house look like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The trash guys took only half of my trash and left a big tire too and they are supposed to take one tire per month! <endOfText>
<human> Why did they left half of the trash? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was working the other day and my supervisor comes up to me out of nowhere, calls the entire department over and just started yelling at me for about an hour. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful, what was he yelling at you about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My internet company tried to not send someone out to fix my internet. It hasnt worked for 3 months <endOfText>
<human> Ah thats so bad. why not raise a complaint <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother took SAT test lately and received 2000 as his final score. I was very surprised and was not expecting it from him at all <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice.  Is he the type to tone himself down in social settings...but he's secretly a wiz kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Overtly superficial people tick me off.  They're nice to you in person but talk crap behind your back that's what you call a two-faced friend <endOfText>
<human> I call them hypocrites. They take advantage of people whenever it suites their needs. Can't stand the presence of such people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new puppy on my birthday. It was a surprise from my girlfriend. He's awesome! <endOfText>
<human> I love dogs, and have three myself. What type of breed is the puppy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked into class yesterday fully unprepared for our final exam. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What happened?  Do you think you did ok anyway? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I talked to my brother the other day. We don't talk much and I miss him. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel, my brother is my best friend but I only talk to him about once a month because he is so busy.  Where is your brother now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store the other day and pushed a cart into a parked car on accident, but I didn't say anything. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did it leave a dent? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends and I had a poker tournament this past weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! How'd you do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Pisses me off when someone interrupts me in the middle of a sentence. Throws off my whole train of thought then I forget what I was gonna say <endOfText>
<human> Did this happen recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little brother go in a car crash over the weekend. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that,  Was it his fault? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My next door neighbor just bought the truck I wanted for myself. <endOfText>
<human> Are you jealous by this or does it make you angry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wednesday is halfway through the week. <endOfText>
<human> True. Do you have any plans for the weekend?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> True. Do you have any plans for the weekend? <endOfText>
<human> I am going to the lake, I am looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my 40th birthday and my coworkers threw me a party. I had no idea! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome that you have such friendly coworkers! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do. I was so surprised they did something so nice for me. <endOfText>
<human> Make sure you give each of them a thank you card <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a loud bang outside my house last night and thought someone was trying to break in. <endOfText>
<human> Did you find out what it was <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Woke up feeling awesome.  I'm thankful for my mental and physical health in general. Know some friends who aren't as lucky <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you're feeling well, it's always important to make your health a priority, without our health we have nothing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a kid with boogers caked on his nose at the grocery store and his parents weren't doing anything about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's disgusting. What kind of parent lets their child run around like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend I went car shopping at my local BMW dealership and saw someone leaving in a brand new i8! I want that car so bad! <endOfText>
<human> Sweet! Wouldn't mind one myself. What do they cost new? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Many years ago, I fell in love with a beautiful woman with whom I was totally entranced. We were together for about three months, then she suddenly cut things off. She had told me she loved me. But in our final conversation, she denied ever having said so. <endOfText>
<human> That is really mean. I am sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a long time ago. It took a long time to get over her, though. I've never again been as deeply in love as I was with her. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. Have you seen or heard from her again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little sister has to sleep in my room this week while we have company over. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think she will keep you awake? How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my cat three months ago. I found her sitting on the porch yesterday. I thought for sure I would never see her again. <endOfText>
<human> That is so amazing.  Animals have an amazing ability to find their way home.  I wonder if it was out there having a Homeward Bound style adventure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine from childhood just told me he got in early on Google stock and is a multi-millionaire. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that would kill to see. Maybe he will hook you up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some photos of my father from when he was my age. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome. Do you look like him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been travelling for three months now. I am really missing my friends and family right about now. <endOfText>
<human> A little homesick?  Are you traveling for vacation or for work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor killed his wife, a year ago. I would sleep during that period of time. I was shocked and afraid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, that is terrible. Has it affected you knowing you slept through that kind of event right next door? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If I'm going to be in a relationship I need girl I can depend on, not some effed up crazy damaged goods type of girl I can't trust <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it's important to find somebody who you will be able to trust and also somebody who will love you for being you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried finishing my application for online college classes today because I need the financial aid, and I found out I don't have enough time to complete the requirements. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Can you ask for an extension? Sometimes they'll be quite accommodating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant stop thinking of my vacation coming up. Im ready to just go. <endOfText>
<human> Good. Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I robbed my grand parents once because of my addiction to drugs. They didn't notice but I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Now that is something I would imagine is hard to deal with. I hope you are in a better place. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned my friend some money when she was having financial troubles. <endOfText>
<human> That's really kind of you. Not everyone can or will do that. I do hope she pays you back! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put a deposit down on a dog, but it died before I could pick it up.  I was so sad. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty heavy. I hope that doesn't discourage you from trying again in the future, especially with a rescue dog or something in that area. If you don't mind me asking, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is starting his first semester at the college I wanted to go to but could never get into. I am very happy for him. He was scared to accept the offer at first because he thought he'd hurt my feelings. I told him that was crazy! <endOfText>
<human> That is so great that he was able to go.  I had the same problem as you, but I started at community college when I was 26 and finished at a 4 year college when I was 32.  It is never too late for you to go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am living on my own now. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome. Is it the first ime? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother was just recently diagnosed with cancer. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible. Is it treatable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having a difficult time doing even basic tasks for myself due to anxiety. But i'm hopeful that something good will happen for me. I feel bad about complaining about anxiety after finding out your mother is ill. <endOfText>
<human> Everyone in life has problems, do not feel bad for sharing yours I hope it gets better for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got approval for a home loan! <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic! It must be a good day for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My work is sending me on a business trip, but I'm really nervous about getting on the plane. <endOfText>
<human> A little anxious?  Have you ever flown on a plane before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a new fishing reel. I can't wait for it to come in the mail. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds cool. Do you go fishing a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just celebrated her one year anniversary at her business <endOfText>
<human> How awesome! She must be proud of herself! Where does she work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We we playing 11 a side football on sundays and won the title as underdogs <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, how long have you been playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went for a job interview last friday and was told I would know by Friday of this week if I got the job. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Do you think did well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This last Saturday, I was waiting in the line for the official to sign my driving license documents at DPS. I don't know how, but i suddenly fell to the ground as if my legs stopped working. It was so embarrassing as there were many people <endOfText>
<human> These people are not people you see everyday. I wouldnt worry about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was invited to a party last week to a pretty shady area. <endOfText>
<human> Why would anyone make a party in a shady area? Was it your friend's party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends shocked me by throwing me a birthday celebration. I had no idea about it until it happened. <endOfText>
<human> Awe. That is soo sweet. You have some really good friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working on getting into grad school. I have to get all my paperwork together. <endOfText>
<human> that is really such a pain, i remember when i had to do my paperwork for school it is not fum <endOfText>

<human> That is so nice what kind was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "My roomate just bought a brand new car. Its the exact same model that I wanted. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me jealous. Do they let you ride in it or anythign? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a hotdog lunch the other day with my last 5.95 and I dropped it while I was getting into my car. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst.  No money and now hungry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't had a girlfriend for a year. <endOfText>
<human> Are you looking for one, or are you enjoying your singlehood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew as soon as I left the interview room that the job was mine. i was very secure with the answers i gave <endOfText>
<human> It's great when you can be so confident after a interview. So I am guessing you got the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a big mistake at work. I am afraid of the consequences. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened? Hopefully they will understand it was a mistake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I adopted an 8 week old kitten last week from the shelter. <endOfText>
<human> Awe. Have you named her already? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting ready to go to sleep and i walked near the bed when I realized I stepped in cat puke. ugh <endOfText>
<human> OMG so gross I would have been so mad where was your cat at the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  submitted a big budget proposal that was approved yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome, are you planning on doing anything to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got offered another job today... Not sure If I should take it. The pay is about the same. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is that similar to what you do now? Sometimes change is good. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah but, the only quesiton is , is this place better, worse or the same? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy with my new diet, I don't feel hungry and have cravings like I usually do <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  I've had trouble with changing my diet before.  What kind are you doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got an advance signed copy of a book by my favorite author. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome who is your favorite author hopefully you can meet that person now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could not believe I wont a raffle at my company last week. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing, I never win anything.  What was the prize? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is learning to overcome his speech impediment.  He is working so hard at it. <endOfText>
<human> What age is he now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend planned a party for me when I returned from college without telling me! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! I would be so surprised! Where you happy for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just bought a lottery ticket because the pot is getting pretty big. I love buying these things because you get to go home and think about all the stuff you'd do with the winnings <endOfText>
<human> I do the same! I will be crossing my fingers for tonight's lottery!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do the same! I will be crossing my fingers for tonight's lottery! <endOfText>
<human> I used to give my mom crap all the time about it, because she'd buy one every week. Then she'd talk about all the nice things she'd do and get for people when she won. But now I can see it was just her way of relieving stress and having fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Scratched someone's car in the parking lot today, bumped it a little with mine as I was pulling in. They were right there when it happened, too. There was a little damage... but they said to not worry about it, that they didn't want to get people involved. That was very nice of them <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of them. So you didn't have to pay anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start my new job on Monday. I almost feel like I am having second thoughts about it though. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you having second thoughts? I have been there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently watched Matilda again. It was one of mmy favorites when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I remember that movie. I used to watch it all the time. What was it like watching it again now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a stroll down memory lane with my best childhood friend last night. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old cat is very sick. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  How old is the cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to get an apple this morning. It was rotting. <endOfText>
<human> That's disappointing. I know how that goes. Its happened to be before <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got home for lunch and found a bat outside on my front porch. It probably has rabies. Bats shouldn't be out during the day. <endOfText>
<human> Doesn't rabies cause sensativity to light? Either way I would freak out... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> What happened did he hurt your dog?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What happened did he hurt your dog? <endOfText>
<human> he got out of the back yard and ran away <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I repaired my bike all on my own, pretty neat what we can teach ourselves on the internet. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Maybe you have a hidden talent lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe I should open up a bike repair shop and live the dream! <endOfText>
<human> I don't see no reason you shouldn't try! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live really far from my family. I have been missing them a lot lately. <endOfText>
<human> I would be too! Try and find a time you can go back and see them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So much stuff going on in our neighbourhood i just don't feel safe anymore. I taught my wife how to use my gun so she could protect herself when i'm at work <endOfText>
<human> that is really sad to hear, i remember when i was a kid there was no problem even leaving the door unlock <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my mom signed me up for therapy tomorrow and only just now decided to tell me about it today. <endOfText>
<human> That seems a little odd.. It sounds like you guys don't have the best communication. Did she say why she didn't ask you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son cheated on an exam in high school last year. I was disappointed when he told me, and I gave him the choice to come clean. I told him I wouldn't turn him in, that only he could decide that. He decided to tell the teacher what he did <endOfText>
<human> He did the right thing, how did the teacher react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I recently decided we are going to get another puppy! He has to go pick him up and the drive is 15 hours! <endOfText>
<human> That must be one special puppy for that drive! How adorable... are you going with him to pick it up?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must be one special puppy for that drive! How adorable... are you going with him to pick it up? <endOfText>
<human> I will have to stay home because we have two kids, but our neighbor actually offered to make the drive with him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor really needed money for food, and so I let her borrow some. <endOfText>
<human> That was very kind of you. It's nice to have good neighbors. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah we have to stick together, and I know she will pay me back. <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope you know that you're appreciated and that was a very nice thing to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was impressed when i saw this guy eat a 3 lbs burger and 1 lbs fries for a free t-shirt <endOfText>
<human> That's a lot of food lol i bet he felt sick afterwards. I think i would try to do the same, just curious if i could eat that much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't feel well after I was told that I did not get the promotion I was expecting. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. Why didn't you get the promotion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had so much fun over the summer that he didn't want to go back to school. <endOfText>
<human> how did the first day go ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hanging out with my friend Justin has become very annoying lately <endOfText>
<human> Oh no why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine won $1000 on a scratch off. The thing is I bought one to and won nothing. He is so lucky. <endOfText>
<human> Aw man!  That stinks!  I never really win things.  Some people have all the luck. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was moved up a grade because she already knew all Information. <endOfText>
<human> Wow she must be extremely smart for her age. That is incredible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has left town for the week and I miss her. It is annoying waiting for her return. <endOfText>
<human> It's really tough, isn't it?  I'm just getting to the end of that with my wife, she's almost back.  What are you going to do with your time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Dang! That stinks. Im sorry. Did they just leave without saying something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my debit card and someone emptied my bank account. <endOfText>
<human> that is annoying, did you contact the bank to report it stolen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My inlaws don't respect my house rules. <endOfText>
<human> That is unbelievably frustrating.  I know exactly what you mean.  What rules do they not respect? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Arby's for lunch today. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good. How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew died yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that.   What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Your car door? That's awful - did they at least leave you a note so you could contact them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Grandma isn't doing well so I'm going to be going over every day to take care of her and cook for her. <endOfText>
<human> whats wrong ? just an older woman ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to give a big speech tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> You must be nervous. What's the speech about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone backed into my trash can and knocked it over. <endOfText>
<human> It the trash can damaged? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend from high school called me out of the blue. It was great to hear his voice again. <endOfText>
<human> How many years has it been since you seen your friend from school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some of the best news finally after a series of bad events. I am feeling quite at peace. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad to hear it. You must be quite content at this moment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really, thats exactly how I am feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Enjoy this moment, and try not to think about the bad that has happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors dog won't stop barking at me. Ugh! <endOfText>
<human> Thats the worst, is it a big dog or little dog?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats the worst, is it a big dog or little dog? <endOfText>
<human> Its a tiny dog, which is even worse because its bark pierces the ear! So annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! What happend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been struggling financially recently. <endOfText>

<human> i am sorry to hear that. But atleast they are having fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to a meeting abroad and the airplane smelled like it had not been cleaned in months <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh, disgusting.  Did you say something to the flight attendants? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When somebody cuts me off I usually try to let it go.  But if it's too blatant I get really mad and usually get even I should work on my road rage <endOfText>
<human> I am just like you. I have road rage. I dont know what it is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday i went to the gym and i forgot to bring my towel. i went to shower and had to go back to my locker naked. so embarassing <endOfText>
<human> Lol that is so funny how did you do that was anyone around? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother lied to me about something major, and I am super upset with him. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible!  I would be too!  I have an older brother and have been right where you are.  What are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hes older as well, nothing I can really do but give him the silent treatment until I can keep my composure! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, make him squirm.  He had better apologize.  <endOfText>

<human> Oh? What did you end up doing with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went out to eat, and showed them the city i live in. We are in totally different states. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty fun to do. I used to do that when i was in college with my family. <endOfText>

<human> I can imagine. Just be cool and do as you have been taught! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes just have faith in yourself and your abilities! <endOfText>
<human> she reminded me that her teacher spent less time with her than she did with me. I'm ahead of the game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went home for the summer and my mum cooked for me every day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! That's so nice isn't it? where were you coming home from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was coming from college. I felt so pampered and cared for. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I felt the same way when I went visit my dad up north. he is a great cook. i bet your mom is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Waiting for an estimate on my roof repair. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What's wrong with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When working on a group project at work I came into contact with someone I was working with who just DIDNT take the TIME to READ the DIRECTIONS. Because of that, the project took too long and neither of us got paid for it. Made my blood boil. <endOfText>
<human> I would be very angry to is there anyway to speak with a supervisor to explain what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw this guy lifting 300 pounds with one arm....it was crazy! <endOfText>
<human> What! My lord that is insane for real, thats a lot of weight. Deadlift or he kept going?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What! My lord that is insane for real, thats a lot of weight. Deadlift or he kept going? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I was coming back home from work and there was a snake by the stairs! I HATE snakes!! I called animal control or whatever it's called. <endOfText>
<human> did you get the snake out? if not this is what you do, get a neighbors cat and place it in the area and wait till the snake is hungry. problem solved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to see someone eat a 3 lbs burger for a free t-shirt <endOfText>
<human> why would somebody overeat for a silly t-shirt?! makes no sense to me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few months ago I opened the door to find a day old baby kitty on my porch. <endOfText>
<human> Awwwww!!! i love kittens, just adopted one. Was it adorable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog broke its leg this morning. <endOfText>

<human> i was planning on visiting this person's space ship on the moon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle had been complaining about his stomach hurting frequently. He had some tests done and from previous genetic testing done that showed he was predisposed to a high risk of cancer. So we all pretty much knew what was wrong with him. Hes doing better though. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear about that. But I am glad to hear he's doing better now!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear about that. But I am glad to hear he's doing better now! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah! That genetic testing really saved him because otherwise he is so not one to go to a doctor unless hes literally on his death bed. <endOfText>

<human> Oh man I would file a lawsuitttttttt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't want to sell my grandfathers old Cadillac for some reason. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand, I'm sure it has sentimental value. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought my kids a slap bracelet the other day, and it reminded me of buying them for myself when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I remember those. The light up ones were the coolest. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends car broke down so i let her borrow mine. <endOfText>
<human> That is very nice of you. You two must be really good friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we are and also i just felt like she wouldnt damage it! <endOfText>
<human> You are very trusting. Its nice to have a friend like you. Im sure she appreciates it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the train to work the other day and it was so crowded. I was feeling really claustrophobic. <endOfText>
<human> I would have been too! Do you always take it to work?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would have been too! Do you always take it to work? <endOfText>
<human> Not at that time. Its just that being around a lot of people makes me feel uneasy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sweet Spring Spaniel died this past weekend. I had him for 14 years. <endOfText>
<human> That is heart breaking! My pitbull died a year ago and I still miss him like crazy. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My boss called me a liar in front of the whole office last week. <endOfText>
<human> That was rude of them. Why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He thought I took money from the petty cash drawer, but they found out who really did it yesterday, and still no apology. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I would go over and talk to that boss and demand an apology <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cant wait for next week! <endOfText>
<human> What's going on next week? <endOfText>

<human> what was the issue that needed fixing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my family in months. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel. I have not seen mine as well as we all live so far away <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was woken up by a noise and it sounded like someone was coming toward my bedroom. <endOfText>
<human> Oh scary! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone riding a unicycle the other day, it seems really difficult. <endOfText>
<human> It is to me. I dont know how people do it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was such a great experience travelling around and trying new foods <endOfText>
<human> it is the best i once went to italy and the food over there is great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i came home from vacation last week. Found my desk a complete mess. <endOfText>
<human> How did that happen? I hope it wasn't a case of break-in and entering. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been hired to help professors with their classes. It was a long interview process but I was sure I could get it. <endOfText>
<human> You must have been very hopeful about your prospects!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You must have been very hopeful about your prospects! <endOfText>
<human> I was, I love education and this is a good step for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got to college and am terribly homesick. I miss my house and my parents. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling. I lived far away from my parents in college. It does get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that my wife had been cheating on me last week. I was not expecting that <endOfText>
<human> Wow that must be awful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that must be awful. <endOfText>
<human> Yea I couldnt believe it.  It's ok though.  I have been spending the nights at her sisters <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat just knocked over the trash and started digging in it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that made quite a mess <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a fly in my house all day yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Flies are the most annoying bugs to have in the house. Finally did you get rid of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's supposed to rain very heavily today so I brought my umbrella to work! <endOfText>
<human> I hate working when it rains hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little boy played flag football last year for the first time and I was so pleased he got out and did something. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice! Does he enjoy playing team sports? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am supposed to give a big speech soon. <endOfText>
<human> dont bee nervous about it panic only makes it worst how are you handling it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I swear to god my sister would travel 30000 miles just to get in my closet and steal my clothes. I need a lock. <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you. I don't have a sister but I wouldn't want my things taken. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its frustrating to say the least especially when she doesnt care if she ruins them as if they arent expensive. <endOfText>
<human> I would need them to replace it. You don't break a bunch of my stuff with no ramifications. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night my dog knocked over all of my figurines. They were lego so they all fell apart. He has never done that before. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have them set up for a while like decor?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you have them set up for a while like decor? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah. They were on top of a tall shelf. Not even sure how he got up there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was out at the bar last night and I ran into my ex.  She was looking great and she tried to get me to go home with her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm guessing it didn't work right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into my closet the other day thinking I had to go buy hangers, but I found a pack I had bought years ago and forgot about. <endOfText>
<human> That would be a nice surprise, now you need not go buy any hangers <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read a book recently that I loved as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> That's always fun! What book was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some old guys offered me candy when I was a kid and we later seen him on the news because he got arrested. I was afraid to leave the house for a while. <endOfText>
<human> OH wow! Did you accept the candy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I shattered a glass at a restaurant. I was mortified. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did that happen?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost all my savings in Vegas last week because of my gambling problem. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so so sorry to hear that, it can't be easy being in that position. Have you spoken to anyone close to you about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I was going to get a tax refund this year. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, that's always fun! Did you get a lot of money back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved into a new house and finally have everything unpacked and set up. It feels like a home finally, it's nice. <endOfText>
<human> It is crazy how long it takes to get everything unpacked in a new house.  Are you loving the new place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet parrot died this week. <endOfText>
<human>  I'm sorry to hear that. I understand they can live a really long time. Was it an old parrot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that. I understand they can live a really long time. Was it an old parrot? <endOfText>
<human> Not hat old, about 25.  He had a lot of years left but he got a disease I can't spell and passed away suddenly.  I've had him since he was a baby though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave home for college and I really miss my home <endOfText>
<human> thats always a really hard thing.  youll have a good time though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, so I just saw that my ex girlfriend just had a baby <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, I would have been shocked. Wow did you react to finding this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I volunteer at the animal shelter to look after puppies on the weekends. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's so caring and lovely! You must enjoy it a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone backed into my truck and broke the tail light. <endOfText>
<human> How much does the damage cost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So when I was younger I had a rather awful birthday <endOfText>
<human> Why was that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor had a party this weekend.  The next morning I wake up and find a bunch of trash is all over my yard from the party <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope he cleared it up - that is not a nice thing to wake up to! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I have to be assertive or confront someone, I get super nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I've had that feeling as well, especially if it is with someone that is close to me.  Is it because you dont like confrontation or a different reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just interviewed for a new job after applying last week! <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, do you feel like you did a great job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hmm.. I think i'm going to catch up on the expanse <endOfText>
<human> oh yea.. whats that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend broke up with me and i am quite upset <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. How long were you together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost over £200 on public transport about 3 years ago! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's a lot of money. Did you get any of it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Although I'm having a difficult time in life right now, and it seems I have been having a difficult time for a while... I still have faith that God will provide for me a blessing. <endOfText>
<human> It is important to have a focus on something positive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The girls at work shocked me with a baby shower when I was pregnant with my first kid. <endOfText>
<human> That must mean they think you're a pretty cool person! People usually don't go through that kind of effort unless they think you're worth it and deserve it. So, kudos to you for having that kind of effect on others! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, you don't work with them anymore? Or maybe it was because you decided to be a stay-at-home mother? <endOfText>
<human> My first child is 12 now so it was quite some time ago. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to trim my beard today. Trimmed a little too much on one side, had to even it out on the other. Did that like four times on accident, and now I trimmed my beard so much more than I wanted to, and I look dumb. <endOfText>
<human> You may need to go to the barber shop! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally lost my patient's necklace before her surgery when I was in nursing school. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! I hope it didn't end up inside them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend didn't call me to invite me on his road trip last weekend. I have no idea why he didn't ask it I wanted to go. <endOfText>
<human> Well that was rude, did you confront him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is just great right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome!  You're really lucky. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car was parked on the street last night and someone hit it.  They didn't even leave a note <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! That sucks! Did anyone happen to see it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So this month we're finishing refinancing student loans, buying a house, and my wife just got another job. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That sounds like a lot of great news in one month! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, I just found out the craziest thing <endOfText>
<human> What did you find out?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to church this past Sunday and the most horrible thing happened.  I literally still can't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> I'm so curious. What happened at church? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's disgusting. I hate it when that happens. <endOfText>
<human> You hate it when what happens? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to get surgery tomorrow morning. I'm really nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> I get really anxious too. What are you having surgery on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting rid of some stuff at my parents house and came across my old school uniform. I couldnt part with it. <endOfText>
<human> did it bring back a lot of memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be complacent and settled for my mediocre life. Now I'm grinding every day for a better life <endOfText>
<human> Good for you.  How is it going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I turned 8 shades of red.  I was blushing so bad <endOfText>
<human> What made you blush so hard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a movie called sinister that really scared the heck out of me. <endOfText>
<human> Did you watch it late at night? I rarely watch scary movies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my nephews basketball game and he was the highest scorer on the team. I had no idea he was that good. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I was a child and I was told that I would need glasses in order to be able to see the whiteboard in the classroom and do good in school. I was so upset because I felt that the glasses made me look ugly. I was so upset. However, my classmates really made me feel better about it. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, glasses suck but, so does not being able to see. Good that your class mates are nice people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't wear a belt today and my pants fit pretty loose... They pretty much fell down while I was at work today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well that would have been embarrassing, but if you were trying to shed a few pounds I would say your doing a great job!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh well that would have been embarrassing, but if you were trying to shed a few pounds I would say your doing a great job! <endOfText>
<human> haha pro's and con's i guess. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is hard to be alone sometimes, this past weekend I feel like I went through every emotion. <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel. What helped me was getting a bicycle and get out in the sun for some exercise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel you. Well it sounds like you keep yourself busy with a hobby at least. <endOfText>
<human> WORK is my hobby! lol and business. Good hobby right now :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't be more thankful to have 3 happy healthy kids. <endOfText>
<human> That is really something to be thankful for. I have lost 2...So for sure! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Super happy I had some funds to today to get some new clothes! <endOfText>
<human> Where did you go shopping? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big exam coming up. I have attended all of the study sessions and reread all the chapters. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel like you are prepared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on short term disability for a severe illness and the doctor said something that stopped my disability early and I didn't know so I had to pay back hundreds. Evil system. <endOfText>
<human> wow thats horrible.  I hate the way they make the system to steal money <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you get it? Was the interview good? <endOfText>
<human> I didnt have an interview.  did you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my girlfriend to marry me... <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did she say yes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today has been a hard day! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry.  What went badly?  One things or just lots of little things? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter came home to shock me by staying for a week before school! It was wonderful! <endOfText>
<human> Oh fantastic! What did you guys do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at an outdoor dinner party last week. I got drunk and fell into the pool in front of everyone. I felt so dumb. <endOfText>
<human> That's so embarrassing, but hey everyone has those moments once in a while.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's so embarrassing, but hey everyone has those moments once in a while. <endOfText>
<human> Yea I think I am going to lay off the drinking for now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A gal my sister knew from highschool (old friend) works in a thrift store I like and today I just didn't feel good and didn't feel like talking to her. <endOfText>
<human> that's sad, bad memories ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So ive been talking to this really cute girl at work for a few weeks.  I really like her.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh good luck man! Hopefully everything works out!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh good luck man! Hopefully everything works out! <endOfText>
<human> Im going to ask her on a date.  I think she likes me, so i really think she'll say yes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a lot of nerves today! <endOfText>
<human> Hm, thats not good. How so, if I may ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea so the farm I had invested my life savings into just got burned due to a wildfire. <endOfText>
<human> WHAT? Do live in california? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I am absolutely devastated. I have no idea how I am going to retire now. <endOfText>
<human> That is so awful! Did you have insurance?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend won the big screen TV at the work raffle. He only put one ticket in there. I put all twenty of mine. He is so lucky. <endOfText>
<human> He sounds like he got really lucky. I'd be pretty jealous of him if I were you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I am. He keeps rubbing it in my face. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that's not a very friend like thing to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been tutoring my nephew in math. He brought back an A on his last test. I am so happy for him. <endOfText>
<human> THAT'S AMAZING, what test was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i did some stupid things when i was younger. But i feel bad about one of them to this day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from grocery shopping to find that my husband had cleaned the entire house up and started dinner. I was amazed. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that must of been such a great surprise. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was. He's not a muti-tasker, which is fine, and I was surprised that he got it all done in the 1.5 hours I was gone. <endOfText>
<human> Dang he should clean my house too then while i am gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was just informed that my computer software is now being used in a school :) <endOfText>
<human> No way! Congrats!!! I bet you feel really excited.  How long had you been developing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I impress myself sometimes.  I used to be terrible at saving money but now I've honed the skill into an uncanny ability I can call on like X-men powers <endOfText>
<human> haha! I hear you! It helps if you have more money to save too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I see little girls around town the past week it makes me remember mine and feel sad but happy. <endOfText>
<human> Where are yours and what's going on withthem? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mine didn't make it. <endOfText>
<human> So sorry to hear that...wish you blessings and health and peace <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always wanted a dog and I came home yesterday to find that my sister got a dog for me. <endOfText>
<human> that was so nice of her i bet you was so happy you much be very special to her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i dont no what to right <endOfText>
<human> I guess neither do I, sorry to hear about your rabbit though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first cage fight is coming up in about a week. I thought I'd be really nervous, but I feel like I'm ready for this! I've been training really hard and it's paying off. <endOfText>
<human> Your a pretty tough guy and you have the wits too dude. You got this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i came home yesterday and my lovely dogs greeted me all happy. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's sweet. I love animals! They love you unconditionally. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rented Thor: Ragnarok recently and was really let down. It just wasn't what I expected. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I hope you didn't spend much on it  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no I hope you didn't spend much on it <endOfText>
<human> I didn't, but I just was all hyped up thinking it was going to be great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hearing Steve Winwood song "Higher Love" made me want to jam out cuz I remember my mom playing it over and over during our old road trips...made me miss her <endOfText>
<human> Aw you must have felt really nostalgic in that moment. Sounds like a great memory. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from vacation and realized food in my fridge was rotting! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh hate when that happens...do you live alone or with roommates <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently tried my luck with online dating <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that one of our coworkers was stealing. <endOfText>
<human> wow, thats horrible. what were they stealing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking home from the store and I saw a little cat trying to cross the road. So I stopped and helped it along! I felt so good! <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. Sounds like you're an animal person <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I see little boys teasing/flirting with my 14-yo cousin I post up on her status and tell them to F**K off and they get scared every time haha...I'm not trying to be mean but she needs someone to protect her <endOfText>
<human> I agree, but maybe you should be a little less aggressive  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, but maybe you should be a little less aggressive <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sick to my stomach right now <endOfText>
<human> oh im sorry to hear that, what caused this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a performance review coming up at work. I am feeling really good about it. I have been killing it everyday at work. <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic, you must feel really confident in your ability. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guess you could say that. My manager has been giving me really good feedback. <endOfText>
<human> Do you receive feedback often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a casual stroll with my old teammate down my trophy hall, and we got sidetracked staring at my multiple super bowl championship rings. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been nostalgic. When did you last pick one up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from vacation yesterday and found some of my stuff was stolen <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Was it expensive items? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For some dumb reason I used to think that hobos were mystical and wise and believe everything they said...now I take everything I hear from a person broker than me with a grain of salt <endOfText>
<human> Interesting! I could see how you thought that. Just because they're homeless and have fallen on hard times doesn't mean they're dumb. But yeah, there's a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament, so their judgment could be questionable.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Interesting! I could see how you thought that. Just because they're homeless and have fallen on hard times doesn't mean they're dumb. But yeah, there's a good chance they did something wrong to be in that predicament, so their judgment could be questionable. <endOfText>
<human> I never said they were dumb.  I just don't trust them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been calling my coworker the wrong name for the past three months. They finally decided to say something about it today. The worst part is I wasn't even close with the name I had been calling them. They're so nice and I felt so bad <endOfText>
<human> Haha I"m terrible with names too.  But for me there are only 2 types of people: ones that are memorable and ones that are boring and if you're boring I definitely won't remember who the hell you are <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and I saw a 5$ bill on the ground, I was so happy! <endOfText>
<human> That is very lucky! Did you see who dropped it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so pleased with the way things are right now. <endOfText>
<human> Is everything going perfectly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finished my favorite show a few days ago. I was really angry but happy at the same time <endOfText>
<human> I get that! What show is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our car was broken in too when we were asleep! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was anything taken? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad I didn't get as much accomplished in the past week as I should! <endOfText>
<human> We all have weeks like that. Don't be too hard on yourself. Everything will get done eventually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I FINALLY get my lawn mower fixed on thursday. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great. Im sure it was cheaper than having to buy a brand new one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a three month trip planned starting in September. I have been counting down the days until I leave. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! 3 months?! Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am always the man and I repeat it as a mantra. When someone tries to get me down I just harden up and remember that I'm probably smarter and tougher than them.  Because I'm a M*****N BAWSSS <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like a great way to keep yourself motivated! <endOfText>
<human> Yessir/maam more people need to think like this honestly.  I'm a millenial and am disgusted by this underlying promotion of self-loathing...it's one thing to be humble but damn son, get that chip off your shoulder by doing something about it!!! hahaha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been preparing for my job interview tomorrow. I think I am going to knock it out of the park. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so mad.  Ive never gotten a speeding ticket before <endOfText>
<human> oh no, how did it happen? were you in a hurry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my another friend of mine had his mother pass away last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, that is tragic. I hope you are there to support him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just came to college and have no friends in my dorm and no one to eat with. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty hard my dude. But join some clubs or get to know some people in your dorm area. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I think I will have to do that because I don't want to feel lonely and cry in my room all day. <endOfText>
<human> Also try joining a club you might end up in apartment with someone next year instead of the cramped dorms. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am confident in my own judgment.  Because I am not just a man---I am THE MAN like that 50 cent song...I'm not perfect but I'm always confident that no matter what I do, the only person who knows what's best for me is ME and no one else <endOfText>
<human> Do you trust other people at all?  It seems like it would be hard to trust someone if you think only you can know what is best for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There has been this sinkhole in my yard since the hurricane hit last year and it is the cities responsibility to take care of it. I called it in about a week after the hurricane and it is almost a year since then. Yesterday someone came out and marked it with flags and Im certain that means they will begin to work on it soon. <endOfText>
<human> how big is it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home the other night <endOfText>
<human> Did you think a bear was going to eat you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no a werewolf <endOfText>
<human> Had you forgotten your pepper spray? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have SO much to get done around here before summer ends, I am feeling positive about getting it done even through pain. <endOfText>
<human> well atleast when you finish you can pop a beer and enjoy your hard work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not a drinker ;) lol. But I will feel accomplished. I would pop a piece of sugar really lol <endOfText>
<human> hahaha yeah or go to a nice restaurant to feel relaxed after all that hard work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went home over the weekend to hang out with some old high school friends and things got a little crazy <endOfText>
<human> As reunions go I guess. How was it crazy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am figuring out my health issues, I feel through lots of research, I can fix it. I am getting things solved and finally feeling better. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you.  We only get one body, gotta take care of it best we can! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a scientific mission to mars when a massive sand storm hit. <endOfText>
<human> lol. Well then darnit I want to be a unicorn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog has cancer. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer.  Is it treatable?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry to hear that.  Unfortunately a lot of dog breeds have a high risk of cancer.  Is it treatable? <endOfText>
<human> I guess not because the surgery didn't work so we have to put her down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor was robbed at home last week.  Since then, she has been too scared to stay by herself.  We let her stay with us for a couple of nights. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrifying! I wouldn't want to stay alone either. That was nice you guys took her in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was upset when i had to miss my son's game <endOfText>
<human> that is not good, why did you miss your son's game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mommy dog does not want to leave her cage even to go potty. <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to pick her up and take her outside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out to eat at what used to be my favorite restaurant last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say used to be your favorite restueraunt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time the service was terrible and the food was gross. It was recently taken over by new management. <endOfText>
<human> Wow.. that really stinks that that happened to your favorite resteraunt  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car was stolen last night! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is horrible! Did you get it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out some old boxes after moving and found pictures from my prom <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, was it nostalgic?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's cool, was it nostalgic? <endOfText>
<human> Yea, I messaged my ex and we were talking about those times.  It was crazy talking about those old times <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was a dog on the side of the road that got hit by a car, and I was so sad <endOfText>
<human> oh no thats horrible.  Im glad i didnt see that, i wouldve been so upset <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was in a ballet recital. She danced so beautifully. I was so impressed. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds wonderful! I bet it was amazing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They looked so nice. And it was in a real theater so it seemed so professional. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I wish I could see something like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a meal from a restaurant yesterday and it had a hair in it! <endOfText>
<human> That is very disgusting. I hope you complained! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother died last night my friend. I am pretty out of it right now. <endOfText>
<human> oh im so sorry, please don't worry, i know it's tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh im so sorry, please don't worry, i know it's tough but i learned that death is only a beginning not the end <endOfText>
<human> That is quite a interesting statement hmmm. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is moving far away. <endOfText>
<human> aww, im sorry. thats always hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on a 4 hour roadtrip the other day and i hate when people play on their phone when I am driving <endOfText>
<human> A road trip sounds fun, but I agree with you. I feel like I am a cab driver when people are on devices and not talking to me at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just applied for a job. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck with that, its rough out there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I'm really nervous that they won't hire me. <endOfText>
<human> I hear ya. Perhaps they will though? gotta stay positive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad because I was texting with my ex the other day <endOfText>
<human> That could be embarrassing, do you have a new partner? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was supring to see a guy eat a 3 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> Did he finish it all?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did he finish it all? <endOfText>
<human> yes and he got a free shirt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I was at the park with my kid and got distracted by my phone. I looked up and my daughter was gone! My stomach dropped and became really scared. Luckily I found her in the tube slide. <endOfText>
<human> oh god that's worse than thinking you lost your phone for a second, i am aware of the feeling, how are you feeling now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down the street and I found a 20$ bill! I was so happy <endOfText>
<human> Did you try to find who the $20 belonged to?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you try to find who the $20 belonged to? <endOfText>
<human> It was just sitting in the grass, what am I supposed to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend wants me to go hiking with him this weekend on some sort of scary trail where there's thin walking trails along some dangerous ledges... Not really my thing, but he's been kind of lonely recently <endOfText>
<human> Well its good that you are helping out your friend. I'm sure he appreciates it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going to see my long distance girlfriend this weekend, and we're going to have a movie marathon. I only get to see her every so often because of the distance. I'm excited <endOfText>
<human> oh welcome to the long distance club! i am exactly in the same situation as you, we are going on a cable car, we are going to meet in 2 weeks and i also can't wait, i feel you, LET'S HAVE  A BLAST <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have left my dog with my brother <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and this guy was carrying 20 bags! It was amazing! <endOfText>
<human> why was it amazing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor passed away a few days ago. She was a nice older lady who'd always greet me when I saw her in the hall. Didn't know her that well, but she seemed lonely. I feel kind of bad for not getting to know her better when she was still alive <endOfText>
<human> Thats really sad.  Im sorry to hear that.  Getting old stinks.  I feel bad when I see someone who seems really lonely <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited! I am going to Hawaii next week <endOfText>
<human> That really is something to get excited about! I've never been outside of the country, so I'm jealous of people that get the chance to. I hope you're able to get everything out of the trip that you want to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait to go.  I started packing already <endOfText>
<human> If I were you, I'd be the same way, just counting down the days. I hope your travel goes smoothly. If you're going with someone special, I hope you guys both enjoy your time there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new cat wont stop knocking over the plates from the counter top <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really annoying, i bet thats making a huge mess <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never win anything cool :( <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Maybe your luck will turn around soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really gullible. I used to believe that a magician could pull coins out of my ears. <endOfText>
<human> Well if he was good at the trick its understandable. As long as you were a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was six months ago. I will believe anything. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you better let someone else do your due diligence you might fall victims to scammers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been in a relationship for a few years and its alright but its nothing terribly special <endOfText>
<human> Must be disappointing knowing the spark isn't there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother is doing so well at his rehab. i'm so proud of him <endOfText>
<human> Im happy to hear that! That is a big step and he needs as much support as possible!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im happy to hear that! That is a big step and he needs as much support as possible! <endOfText>
<human> he was able to stand for the first time today. i'm so happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend I had a plan to go to the springs with a couple of my friends and camp out. We ended up not going at all because the weather got really bad. I was really upset because everyone took off work and we probably wont be able to all get together like that again this summer. <endOfText>
<human> that stinks i'm sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My co-workers were really sweet to me a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What did they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm always ready for anything <endOfText>
<human> That's good! Always smart to be prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked a girl out on a date the other day.  It didnt go the way I expected <endOfText>
<human> Good for you, how did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my friend got evicted from his apartment recently and he has 2 dogs. <endOfText>
<human> that sucks, perhaps he should of be saving his money to pay for his apartment, instead of having two dogs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I just got promoted to manager... <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very depressing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a teenager my family moved around a lot. I never looked forward to entering a new school. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, I imagine nothing ever became familiar to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You just get settled in and then you go again. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, a bit like how my employment goes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i miss my familly so much <endOfText>
<human> Do they live far away from you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i walked in to the bathroom at work after someone used it <endOfText>
<human> uhoh.  I hope it was ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no it stunk and they clogged the toilet. <endOfText>
<human> ewww thats so gross.  I hope you didnt have to clean it up <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I were taking a break for a little while, but we found a spark recently <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome. stay positive i hope things will work out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went on a date last night <endOfText>
<human> Oh really did you meet them from tinder <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year we won our football league when we were actually underdogs, it was a fantastic moment! <endOfText>
<human> How did you celebrate after? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at Taco Bell and someone paid for my food! I couldn't believe it! <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty awesome my dude. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was taking a friend home from work one day and it started to rain as we got to his place. Like a down pour. <endOfText>
<human> Did he get soaked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My new Tesla has a new autopilot and it drove autonomously for 4 miles! <endOfText>
<human> That's so cool! I would love to have a car like that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents took me out to eat at a fancy restaurat last night. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so nice of them! Did you enjoy it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I did, and it was a really kind and generous thing for them to do. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, they must really love you a lot <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the fair and I spilled my drink all over me. I was soaked <endOfText>
<human> Well did people  help you get cleaned off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked through my old neighborhood this past weekend. All sorts of memories came flooding back. <endOfText>
<human> I love when that happens!  I did the same thing not too long ago when I was in the area I grew up in.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love when that happens!  I did the same thing not too long ago when I was in the area I grew up in. <endOfText>
<human> I know right, I love the blast of nostalgia which makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad! I just got charged double for something I only got one of! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, I hope it was only a sincere error and not the charger being malicious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work in a restaurant and I spit on a customers food yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, why on earth did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was being really rude, but I still feel a little bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> As you should, spitting in food is never the right answer. Hopefully you learned something from this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I heard a strange noise coming from the kitchen late at night <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Did you go check it out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea, turned out it was just the wind. It was terrifying nonetheless <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I think I would have felt the same! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I probably shouldn't have, but I let go the wheel and let autopilot steer my car for 2 miles <endOfText>
<human> Why inspired you to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently purchased a new car, and within the week got rear-ended in traffic <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that! It must be infuriating to have that happen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the mall and I smelled the sweet smell of cinnamon rolls. It reminded me of home <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome. where is your "home"? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am on some meds that are making me feel totally off <endOfText>
<human> What are they making you feel like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a surprisingly good meal last night. <endOfText>
<human> oh really, did you prepare it yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No it was at a restaurant. It's not something I usually order but my friend convenienced me to do it. <endOfText>
<human> well good thing you listened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a strange figure in the woods whilst camping last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> That must have frightened you.  Was it the beef jerky sasquatch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been without water all day at my house. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, how are you going to bathe and use the restroom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really good at my job <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Do the people you work with know it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah my boss can always count on me to do my job well. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you get a raise soon <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our teenage son drove his car for the first time today <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What kind of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to water my plants while I was on vacation but she didn't and they died. I was so mad <endOfText>
<human> Oh no ! Did she offer to replace the cost of the plants at least ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the wife to lunch today for our anniversary. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Always good to go on a date and celebrate your love. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I smelled the perfume my ex used to wear in the mall today <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that stink. I bet you will find someone though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just told me that she is having a baby! <endOfText>
<human> It must be such an exciting time for her and your family! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been training for the football match all week. The hardest I have ever trained <endOfText>
<human> Do you think you have pushed your self enough or are you worried?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you think you have pushed your self enough or are you worried? <endOfText>
<human> I think I have pushed myself enough, I feel prepared and think my team is going to win the match <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I was young, if your parents wanted to know where you were, they'd go looking for your bicycle lol <endOfText>
<human> Wow you must be pretty old, did you have indoor plumping  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> lol not that old. :) It's just before we had cell phones. The playground was OUR Playstation <endOfText>
<human> Well that sounds pretty fun, It must have been nice to grow up during the 60s <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow you must be pretty old, did you have indoor plumping <endOfText>
<human> lol not that old. :) It's just before we had cell phones. The playground was OUR Playstation  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my boss has been taking advantage of me being a hard worker <endOfText>
<human> That's aweful! What do they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I meet with my boss today thinking I was getting a raise. I didn't get a raise. <endOfText>
<human> why did you not get your raise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know. My boss never asks to meet with me so I thought we we're going to talk about me getting a raise. <endOfText>
<human> that stinks. i know how that feels. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We saved up all year to take a nice beach vacation. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Was it worth it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So worth it!  It was our first family vacation, so it was really special. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you got plenty of photo's? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got my marks best for the test <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really want to lose weight but keep just binge eating. <endOfText>
<human> What is your goal weight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my wife to one of her favorite restaurants, and apparently today was their anniversary so they gave us a free (small) desert. It was kind of nice, really. <endOfText>
<human> Did she appreciate it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow just got chased through a haunted house. <endOfText>
<human> What was chasing you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just got laid off from her job. I'm so angry. <endOfText>
<human> Why are you angry, did you sister get unfairly fired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so glad to have good friends <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great. Its good that you have a support network like that. <endOfText>
<human> It is. They are llike family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Proud of my friend! He recently made a hockey team. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Is it his first year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got ditched by my friend for the third time this week, when trying to make plans. Wish people weren't so flaky these days. Why does it feel like I'm putting in more effort to hang out with people than vice versa? <endOfText>
<human> Its definitely not fair. It seems almost as if people do not TRY to create a friendship or are playing both ends of the candle to see which bargain (plans) per friends are better, and then make a choice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husbands open heart surgery for Monday was postponed. We have to deal with Kidney related issues now <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. My parents used to struggle with health issues too, and I'd worry just as much as they would. Do you know when it may be rescheduled for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really enjoy family traditions <endOfText>
<human> That is good. What are some of your favorites? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just applied for a new job. <endOfText>
<human> that's cool. what kind of job did you apply for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Proud of my mom. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Why are you proud of her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my Grandma. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to your grama? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She died when I was a kid from cancer. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that ,were you close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really have a blessed life and i am so happy <endOfText>
<human> Well you must be very lucky then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a speeding ticket today and did not realize I was speeding. The look on the policeman's face though, was as if I robbed a bank ! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how fast were you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going 44 in a 30.  I was late for work, and I guess it just slipped my mind. <endOfText>
<human> That can happen to anyone though. It was speeding, but at least it wasn't wreckless driving! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get my final grades for last semester this week and I am sure I did great. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. What is your future endeavor comprised of ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This guy at work is really annoying me. <endOfText>
<human> What is he doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The problem is, He is super close to the manager and she loves him because they have "a thing" going on and thats even more frustrating <endOfText>
<human> That's no good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to keep faithful at the party. <endOfText>
<human> What was tempting you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really happy with life right now. Things just seem to always go my way! <endOfText>
<human> What went right last? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate being around negative people and situations <endOfText>
<human> I do too! Have you had a specific situation lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm worried about my final exam. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you'll be fine if you study enough! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My bff cancelled our plans last minute <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens. It's such a bummer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey man guess what i found my old Pooh Bear doll. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's really cool. Was it from your childhood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like my brother. I've looked after him since we were both little. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good wish my brother was like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah we are really good friends too. <endOfText>
<human> Man that just makes me jealous some. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drank the last of my roommate's beer last night. He still doesn't know. <endOfText>
<human> How likely is he to go ape shit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me: I was driving to work and saw a black guy with dreads doing a wheely on a bike that looked like it was for a 12 year old. It was pretty impresive <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, I have seen those kind of micro bikes before. Takes some skill I suppose. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe that's all he could spare for. Still got to stunt whenever possible. <endOfText>
<human> I was like dang that dude is getting it much respect <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really love disney. <endOfText>
<human> Yep I like them too. Especially Frozen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat keeps knocking over my card sculptures. <endOfText>
<human> I love cats, did you punish her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am really excited about trying to have a baby with my husband <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awesome. Finally ready for the baby?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's awesome. Finally ready for the baby? <endOfText>
<human> we have been trying for 6 years and haven't had any luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to ride a jet ski for the first time this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> that is so stinking awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe one day i'll make enough money for my family. <endOfText>
<human> Are you not able to make ends meet right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went on my first roller coaster last month! I was scared out of my mind and was sweating bullets! <endOfText>
<human> I would never be able to do that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really excited for this weekend <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What do you have planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visited my old high school yesterday <endOfText>
<human> That had to be a weird feeling.  How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was suprised. It really brought back a lot of fond memories. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine.  Ive never been back to mine, but i can still picture in my mind what it looks like <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworkers are really annoying. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! I would hate that  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah they talk like they know it all but they are terrible at their jobs. <endOfText>
<human> That's always got to be the worst thing to deal with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Uh oh! I would hate that <endOfText>
<human> Yeah they talk like they know it all but they are terrible at their jobs.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling quite confident going in to this exam. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? What is the exam for? I hope you do well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my high school reunion the other day and got myself into some trouble <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. A little too much to drink? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising when i saw this guy eat a 3 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> Wow he must have been hungry as hell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a divorce a few years back. It was pretty rough <endOfText>
<human> how are you doing now ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This ref had the gall to call off my goal. <endOfText>
<human> Damn was it a bogus call or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a patient guy...but if there's one thing I can't stand it's a stupid person who is stubborn about their own stupidity <endOfText>
<human> I agree, they think they're so smart but they are not! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss when I was younger. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling.  I wish i could go back to being little again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before I got my dog, my life felt empty. He's my best friend now ! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! He sounds like a good addition in your life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is now complete. He's so trustworthy and listens to everything I say to him lol. <endOfText>
<human> Awe I love my dog too, she's really sweet. Well except my dog doesn't listen, so I guess your dog beats mine, lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Other people always have more food than me. <endOfText>
<human> Are you jealous of them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel good about my applications. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully you do well with it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really bad lunch yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> ohno, what did you have? what was bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was pizza that I usually like, but they must have changed their recipied because the sauce tasted like vomit. <endOfText>
<human> ewww that sounds disgusting.  I would have complained <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent the whole day trying to help my friend find his dog <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of you. Did you find it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Greetings!  A while back we had a groundhog make a little den underneath our deck to have it's babies.  We were going to call animal control but decided to wait because I thought it'd be more human.  After a couple weeks they left on their own. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty compassionate of you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I hear 80s instrumentals and it reminds me of my family's Christmas karaoke nights, good times :)) <endOfText>
<human> Good times indeed!  Those were the days.  It seems cliche to say they were simpler times because I remember them saying that back then about when they were younger.  History repeats itself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm meeting with my boss tommorrow. <endOfText>
<human> how come? is everything alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tutored my little cousin in math. He made an A on his test. He did so much better than before. <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store the other day and some old man offered to pay for my drink! He said he didn't want anything in return, he was feeling generous! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I wish something like that would happen to me. That is so cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker got a raise over me. <endOfText>
<human> when is the beat down scheduled for and how can i help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think we need to go that far. I'm just jealous because I do much better job than her. <endOfText>
<human> no no, we need revenge. think about it and let me know <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Expecting the worst and hoping for the best has always worked out in my favor. <endOfText>
<human> I think that way too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The garbage collector did not take my trash today. <endOfText>
<human> Hate when that happens...if it happens more than once you can file a complaint with the city council <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got home from class and she's gone. <endOfText>
<human> who? is everything alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope to be able to get my finances in order by the end of the year <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a plan made up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm working on it <endOfText>
<human> I think you can do this, I'm proud of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I downloaded some old Nintendo games last weekend. I havent played some of those games since I was a little kid. <endOfText>
<human> I love Nintendo, I use to play every time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am shocked that it isn't rained today. <endOfText>
<human> I know. The news said it was 100% but nothing so far. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate had sex on my bed. <endOfText>
<human> were you in bed with your roommate ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was impressive seeing someone eat a 3 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> That is impressive! Where they ok afterwards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> nah they were puking like a waterfall <endOfText>
<human> That's what they get for eating that much food! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a speech in front of a few of my friends, I was nervous but really comfortable and I knew I could do it <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you did great! I hate public speeking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend has been spending a lot of time with a new friend he met at work. <endOfText>
<human> Is the friend a female? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got pulled over by the police earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Oh shoot! That's never fun. Did you get a ticket? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She just drove off after hitting my cat. <endOfText>
<human> Dammmnn is your cat ok?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Detachment from the outcome is key to my personal success. Because even though I don't get my way one time, I know the odds will be better the next couple of times around it's how lady luck works <endOfText>
<human> You sound like you'd be a good therapist. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent some time with my middle daughter by taking her to ice cream. She is so sweet and lovely. We had a very special time. <endOfText>
<human> That's great that you had such a good time. You sound like a good parent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is hard, but my kids are happy and they know I love them. I think that is the most important thing. <endOfText>
<human> That really is. When I comes down to it what a kid wants most from a parent is love.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm worried about the end of the world <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why are you worried about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Because it's coming! I'm ready for it though because I have bunch of supplies to survive. <endOfText>
<human> Well it is good that you are prepared. It is always important to have extra supplies in case of an emergency.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well it is good that you are prepared. It is always important to have extra supplies in case of an emergency. <endOfText>
<human> Not just an emergancy. THE END OF THE WORLD <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I saw Shin Lim's new performance on AGT!  Right before his performance he put out a video on YouTube and let everyone know it was about to happen.  It was great. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa!  I saw his initial performance and was blown away!  That must have been amazing to see! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking out of the store the other day and walked right into the glass pane! It was so clean, I didn't realize the door wasn't open! Talk about humiliating! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  I remember doing something similar when I was younger.  There was a pool outside of our screen door.  I went to run and jump into the pool from in the house and smashed right through it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Stupid stubborn people are....the worst. Like, Stupid people still have hope, you can convince them if they are humble enough...but a stupid person with an ego is like trying to wash dishes with cat piss and horse sh*t <endOfText>
<human> know it all people drive me nuts too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really miss my family <endOfText>
<human> Are you a college student? Or just living far away from them <endOfText>

<human> Oh no, that sucks man. I hope you didn't miss out on too much when you had to go into work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was embarassed when my pants fell down in class <endOfText>
<human> How did that happen? I am so sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really good job interview. It is so nerve racking waiting for the call to see if I got it or not. <endOfText>

<human> Oh no, I've never had a cat because my husband and brother are allergic. Is she trying to mark her terriorty? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People never listen to me when i talk. <endOfText>
<human> why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking the eagles can win it all again this year! <endOfText>
<human> I'm more of a dallas fan myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of my brother for graduating high school, it is common but still an accomplishment <endOfText>
<human> It sure is.  It is an important step in this road we call life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a car alarm go off at work and I started getting upset that no one was turning it off.  Then I discovered it was from my car. <endOfText>
<human> why did it go off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some dude..because I live in a ghetto city..thought it was okay to pull up on my property beeping until I came out..smoking his cig with ashes in my driveway <endOfText>
<human> That is a strange scenario. Do you live in chicago. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Makes me so angry at how UNCOUTH people are here. NOPE I live in michigan <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I dropped my son off at daycare for the first time this week. <endOfText>
<human> Nice. What was his first day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My landlord didn't want to repair the ceiling. He take the rent but he doesn't want to make any reparations. <endOfText>
<human> I would be so frustrated.  Do you have any way to make him do the necessary fixes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I make a lot of money at my job. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks! It feels really good to provide for my family and give them everything they need. <endOfText>
<human> I wish you the most success. <endOfText>

<human> i hope so too. i don't know if i can handle bad news honestly i'm at the end of my rope. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Thanks for realizing my pain. It saddens me that I these lovely companions can't live with us forever. <endOfText>
<human> I know, it's defenitly painful to have to go through but its part of life. Maybe get a new puppy to start loving/sharing life with, shelters have so many dogs that need homes! <endOfText>

<human> I bet you'll have a little extra power now <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> OOOh boy I'm getting my bags packed and ready to go! <endOfText>
<human> Are you leaving on a jet plane?  I am guessing you are going on vacation? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on the other side of the country on a work trip by myself.  I felt very isolated and had no one to hang out with for a 2 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> You could have gone to a bar and found some friends  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You could have gone to a bar and found some friends <endOfText>

<human> Lucky! I love when that happens!  <endOfText>

<human> I always hear about it happening to others but never me. I got myself a good lunch with that. <endOfText>

<human> I agree with you. I am looking to move now. I don't want to deal with him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This guy "friend" my ex was talking to all of the time made me uncofortable <endOfText>
<human> I understand. Me too, I don't like people talking too much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's weird and uncomfortable. Especialy  when there is a past there <endOfText>
<human> Are you still seeing him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i knew i shouldnt have trusted my brother with my dog <endOfText>
<human> Did he give her a haircut? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I forgot to tip my waitress last weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did the waitress realize it before you left? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think so.  she was busy. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I bet, that is a great achievment! Loosing weight is hard! Keeping it off is even harder. <endOfText>

<human> Oh I am sorry to hear that. You must have been close to her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked for a company for 5 years and I found a new job that paid better. I worked out the last of my shifts but I felt bad for leaving a company that was so good to me. <endOfText>
<human> I get that, but money talks at the end of the day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, I still am not over it <endOfText>
<human> That is always tough to deal with.  Time can help, but it can't get you over the loss of a loved one. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Oh no, I'm sorry man. Hopefully next time. Were you at least able to reach out and see what you could improve upon? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Another one of my friends got engaged <endOfText>
<human> You are saying it as if it's a bad thing, are you left without friends? <endOfText>

<human> Yum!!!!! I literally just watched a recipe on how to make a vegan chocolate cake so I'm craving one!  With tons of icing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently sat down and went through some old love letters I wrote my wife when we were younger. Talk about brought back so many memories of when we were young and life was so simple. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah that must have been a trip down memory lane. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I inherited my grandfathers watch when he passed. I like to wear it as a reminder of him. <endOfText>
<human> I bet he would be proud <endOfText>

<human> Health is truly a blessing! How old are your children?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have 4. They are 21, 19, 17, and 14. It makes me so sad to watch tv or be on the internet and see all the children living in poverty or with diseases like cancer. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I can't imagine what it must be like to be a parent and go through that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Health is truly a blessing! How old are your children? <endOfText>
<human> I have 4. They are 21, 19, 17, and 14. It makes me so sad to watch tv or be on the internet and see all the children living in poverty or with diseases like cancer.  <endOfText>

<human> Really, where is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband works really hard for our family and makes good money.  We've made choices to give our kids experiences rather than have the biggest house. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I stole a bottle of wine from the store. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> We're going to the amusement park this weekend <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! Which amusement park? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Fall is coming and it'll be getting chilly outside. I remember my mom making mulled cider every autumn. Wonderful memories. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats's nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, fall is my favorite season with pumpkin festivals and pumpkin pie! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> he didn't pick up our son and now his phone is off. <endOfText>
<human> Do you plan on arguing to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe someone hit my car and took off! Some people have no morals. <endOfText>
<human> uh I've heard way too many people experience that. Why don't people just not hit you in the first place, if they don't want to take responsibility? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend used to not be very active. Now she does triathlons! <endOfText>
<human> Wow I wish I could make a change like that! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Man I tried something really GROSS the other day <endOfText>
<human> what did you try? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was suprising to see someone eat a 5 lbs burger the other day <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds delicious!  I bet you could do it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors left trash all over the stairs. <endOfText>
<human> That's rude. Do it they do that often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom used to make me fried rice all the time, when I was little <endOfText>
<human> I love fried rice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend brought me some pizza, since I'm working late. <endOfText>
<human> It is very nice from him. Until what time did you work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never brought back a book that I took from the university library. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's really quiet around here right now. No one's at work besides me and the security guard downstairs <endOfText>
<human> Eek! Sounds pretty scary! I hate to be alone at night.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Eek! Sounds pretty scary! I hate to be alone at night. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, so do I. You'd think I'd get a lot done, but it's just so quiet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been getting really bad headaches recently <endOfText>
<human> Headaches really suck, I'm so sorry to hear that. Any idea why you've been getting bad ones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are taking a big trip next summer to Florida for our daughter's high school graduation. <endOfText>
<human> She must be so excited! How long will you guys be there for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so tired from today. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. What's got you feeling so tired? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog saw this cat being chase and scared the other dog away <endOfText>
<human> Wow, your dog is that cat's hero! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For sure. The cat licked her. <endOfText>
<human> I bet your dog is pretty smart. I mean she was able to notice a cat in danger and helped out and all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out my sister in law's husband was cheating on her for the past three years. As someone who is has been married for over 12 years and never even considered the idea of cheating, I'm shocked. <endOfText>
<human> I don't understand why people just don't break up. Why cheat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got some food today. So happy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Im sorry. Im sure your excited now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A random number won't stop calling me, even after I blocked them. I can't stand it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh man! That would scare the heck out of me  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man! That would scare the heck out of me <endOfText>
<human> It's like phone scams but ugh I think I'm going to change my phone number <endOfText>

<human> That sounds delicious, do you know how to make it now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend asked his girlfriend of 8 years to marry him, and she said no. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, why stay with him for so long if she was going to say no? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm upset at my brother for stealing my ice cream <endOfText>
<human> Tell him he owes you one now. Can't just be taking people's ice cream. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother just surprised me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I went to the bar last weekend <endOfText>
<human> What happened there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 19 year old sister is afraid to stay home alone at night. <endOfText>
<human> I would be too, does she live in a bad neighbourhood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was pissed when i saw someone had put a dent in my door <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, people are so reckless. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got my marks back! <endOfText>
<human> Yea? How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It feels kinda different without roomies now. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel more lonely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year i started a job that i didn't expect to be good at or enjoy. <endOfText>
<human> I assume that this job turned out to be the complete opposite of what you expected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat ignores me until she wants food from me <endOfText>
<human> How long have you had your cat? Mine used to be like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is the only girl at her new job. <endOfText>
<human> Oh does she feel weird about that? Where does she work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was scared walking home last night <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  Did something happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We got a new printer installed at work today <endOfText>
<human> oh cool, did it get the job done ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No it sucks sooo bad!   It's already a pain in my butt! <endOfText>
<human> ah that stinks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy got some new reebok shoes, I'm jealous. <endOfText>
<human> Reeboks? Save your jealousy lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am going to meet my soul mate this year <endOfText>
<human> Where are you meeting her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have so many birds and cats coming to my yard. I'm going broke buying food for them. <endOfText>
<human> I wish I could be broke doing something as cute. Seriously that's awesome in a way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is getting old. She still acts like a baby though. <endOfText>
<human> That makes two of us! Big old baby dogs are the cutest though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped in the house the other day <endOfText>
<human> Did you discipline him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Phew that was close. <endOfText>
<human> What happended? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot stand my sister in law.  I'm literally sick over how she treats her boys. <endOfText>
<human> What is she doing to boys? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so ready to see my exam marks. <endOfText>
<human> How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every year I plan to start working on Christmas early so it's not so crazy when the month of December actually gets here. <endOfText>
<human> Have you started? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tore my jeans while climbing a fence, and my friend gave me her sweater to wrap around my waist <endOfText>
<human> That is a good friend, but I'm sorry you tore your pants.  Why were you climbing a fence? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is going to work overseas. We've never been apart for more than a couple of days. <endOfText>
<human> What do you plan on doing while you're alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got scared to death. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car got towed when I was getting coffee for my boss <endOfText>
<human> Ouch that's awful!  Did you get it back yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview coming up <endOfText>
<human> Are you switching jobs? Does the new one offer more money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped on a scale today... and I was in shock. <endOfText>
<human> Oh did you? What happened?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure our dance show will go well. We've practiced for months. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. You must have trained really hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Trying out food from this new place. A lot of people tell me it's good. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I bet your excited about it. I love trying new places.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice! I bet your excited about it. I love trying new places. <endOfText>
<human> Yea. Totally. My favorite place closed down, so it's been hard trying to find a replacement. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My debit card was blocked and called my bank to resolve the issue. Can you believe it, it took me hours until i could get to a representative. What an unacceptable level of customer service they have <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, maybe it's time to switch banks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got caught in the rain before work and arrived soaked <endOfText>
<human> That is bad. You should have immediately gotten a towel and dry yourself. You could get sick <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math exam tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you studied for it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like going out to eat, but it might be bad for my health <endOfText>
<human> Well, I think that all depends on where you're eating and how much you eat. Do you think you're eating anywhere unhealthy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran over a huge pile of garbage today. It was pretty nasty. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god. Did anyting get stuck on your car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Gonna ask my best friend out this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Where are you going to go?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice! Where are you going to go? <endOfText>
<human> Probably to the harbor. She likes the water. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've spent so much time the last few days going through old photos and trying to organize them. <endOfText>

<human> What things are you wanting to go as planned? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently my city did away with breed specific bans for dogs, it is a good thing. <endOfText>
<human> I can't even imagine what would make them ban certain dogs to begin with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> there is this guy that always comes in my store, he is an older man, i think he might be homeless. he always asked for napkins and a glass of water <endOfText>
<human> Does he get anything else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my math test today. I feel horrible about it. <endOfText>
<human> Hmm..I think we've all been there one time or another.  Are you going to admit it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were supposed to go on a mini-vacation for labor day but we had to cancel it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why did you cancel? That's the best time to go! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been crushing on this girl a while, and I'm going to ask her out. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I thought my life was over when my dog died. <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry! I bet your very sad right now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my mom about washing the car today. I feel really awful about it. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you decide to tell your mom you washed it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling really down about hearing my best friend's doggy passing away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, that's so sad to hear. How is he holding up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like people who cut in line <endOfText>
<human> Me either, so rude! It happens too often.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me either, so rude! It happens too often. <endOfText>
<human> it's like they think your time is worthless, I don't understand it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend and I have been friends for over 20 years. I feel really lucky to have such a great friend. <endOfText>
<human> That's so great! You guys have been able to stay close after so long! You must be very compatible with each other <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> After I performed at school, so many girls are hitting me up, but I've got a girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> OH man! I bet you were overwhelmed! did you stay faithful to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my biology exam tomorrow. I am so nervous about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope to get engaged soon, I have been with my boyfriend for 6 years <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too! Do you know if he is planning on proposing anytime soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be so scared to go to sleep as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> How come? Were you scared of the dark? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my car is the worst <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I know car problems can be frusterating.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I know car problems can be frusterating. <endOfText>
<human> My friends all have nice new cars. I need a new car and new friends <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hear ya. Stay hopefull. It will come soon with dertermination. <endOfText>
<human> i hope so. I dont like walking in this weather <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There were 7 kittens on my doortstep this morning. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome!  Cute kitties!  Did you feed them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're celebrating our 10th anniversary this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That's pretty amazing. So many people break up so easily. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at what Andrew Cuomo said. <endOfText>
<human> These people are becoming so pathetic and out of touch with reality that logic and reasoning are becoming an aliens to them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This Monday, for our team's weekly meeting, i am expected to make a big presentation about my progress on the project in front of the CEO of the company I work for. I am very nervous and full of anxiety <endOfText>
<human> You will do fine, just relax. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I yelled at my dog to come inside. I feel so bad. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been studying for my final math test this whole week. Never felt so ready for it! <endOfText>
<human> Very good! I bet your anticipating a good turn out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really am embarrassed I lied about my weight. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you lie? I'm on a new diet that I'm really happy with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss living in Montreal, it was a fun city <endOfText>
<human> I love Canada, do you speak French? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog had been missing for two days.  Then she suddenly was at the front door when I got home!  I thought she was gone for good. <endOfText>
<human> That is a miracle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy to see my friend got engaged <endOfText>
<human> oh congratulations to your friend! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a full ride scholarship for overseas <endOfText>
<human> Ooh, where are they going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm starting an internship in the next couple weeks, I'm exciting but also kind of nervous <endOfText>
<human> Being nervous is totally understandable. They chose you, so they definitely think you can do it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's a good point, thanks! It's just weird, being at kind of the bottom of the ladder <endOfText>
<human> Hey, you'll be going up that ladder and will be looking back at how much you've accomplished one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's been raining everyday, and I'm starting to hear water dripping in my attic <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Have you gone up to check if there's a leak?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! Have you gone up to check if there's a leak? <endOfText>
<human> I tried, but I'm afraid of following. The floor is spaced. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm scared of the hooligans in my neighbourhood, they like to break into garages <endOfText>
<human> That sounds scary! Has your place been broken into? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my dog, I feel so bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope you find him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a prize at the fair, it was ok I guess. <endOfText>
<human> What was the prize? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed my lucky pencil two weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, Did you lose it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my dog will win the beauty pageant this year <endOfText>
<human> It's good. Do you prepare him that ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't pay my rent. I am homeless. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. Do you have a job? Where do you work that you could not make even a rent payment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Past month, i consistently visited gym and followed diligently on my exercising plans. As a result, I gained 4 pounds of muscle mass. I feel very capable of my abilities <endOfText>
<human> Nice, you must look like The Hulk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would like to try ice skating even though my balance is horrible <endOfText>
<human> It'll take some getting used to. Keep at it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm really happy in life right now. I have my cat, books and can eat all the good foods <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I also have a cat, she's so precious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my sister's pen. It's her lucky one. She didn't scold me. But I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no you should buy her a new one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Truly this will be the greatest day of our lives <endOfText>
<human> Why do you say that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen this girl I went to school with in Elementary school for years. She was really chubby but now is a stunner <endOfText>
<human> So does that mean she isn't chubby now? Or still chubby but grew into it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my bosses car for a drive last night. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Is it a fancy One? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend broke up with me yesterday. This place is so quiet without her <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  You should have some friends over.  Throw a party and catch up on old times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know, that's a good idea. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it's always good to hang out with friends.  That cheers me up when I'm down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a coyote in the neighbourhood the other day! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, was he scared of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to see the dentist but I hate that trip. <endOfText>
<human> me too, I'm long overdue to go to the dentist <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you seen equalizer 2? <endOfText>
<human> No. What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I divorced my wife, I have no one to be with now. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you guys get divorced? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom and dad divorced when I was 9 and I went to live with my dad at age 10, <endOfText>
<human> Did you like living with your Dad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My hamster died yesterday. I am so distraught! <endOfText>
<human> oh no! I bet your so sad right now. im sorry for your loss <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend didn't want to go to dinner with me. She went with another guy instead. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful, I'm sorry. Does she want to be with the other guy instead of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed the next film Mile 22. <endOfText>
<human> Nice movie! I bet you had a fun and joyful time watching it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice movie! I bet you had a fun and joyful time watching it. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, there was a ton of action in it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope I'll get the funding for my experiments <endOfText>
<human> Hey me too!  What are you working on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We got this new printer at work and let me tell you what <endOfText>
<human> What? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yikes! Y'all need another new printer <endOfText>
<human> I know right!!! At least spend the money on a good one!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting on some test results from the dr and it's taking forever! <endOfText>
<human> That can be tough. I hope everything is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat has to be put down next week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  I'm so sorry, we just went through that with our pup.  It's a hard choice to have to make. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some people are so slow at answering text messages, it's like they read it and never reply <endOfText>
<human> I agree. Its frusterating, especially when it was an important conversation.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree. Its frusterating, especially when it was an important conversation. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, my friends are flakey I guess. I hate that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate some Korean food the other day. I really liked it <endOfText>
<human> Yum! I have never had it. I bet you enjoyed it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math test tomorrow. I've never been so nervous! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, I can relate.  I always get uneasy before a big test.  And I always end up cramming and studying the last minute. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate it when the waitress bring another table food when I got there first <endOfText>
<human> I cannot stand that!  Did this happen to you recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our youngest daughter is in a local ballet company.  They are dancing at Scottish Rite Children's hospital next month. <endOfText>
<human> Beautiful! You must be so proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We played with the neice and nephew outside all day today! <endOfText>
<human> That's sounds like a lot of fun! What did you guys do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bowling alley all by myself because my friends ditched me. It was pretty darn awful. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have fun there by yourself at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm happy I'm not lactose intolerant, I love cheese so much <endOfText>
<human> Me too! Gouda is my all time fav. What's yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog performed his first trick today! <endOfText>
<human> Whoo! What trick was it? How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm upset that my husband is lazy <endOfText>
<human> Could there be a reason that he is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to fix cars with my dad, when I was little <endOfText>
<human> Fun! You guys got to spend a lot of time together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't like it when mosquitoes attack me while I'm having a good time at the beach <endOfText>
<human> I agree! How annoying that is! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been married to my wife for over 20 years now <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is a long time. How did you keep it together that long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe they canceled it after only six episodes <endOfText>
<human> Oh what show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Christmas is my favorite time of the year.  I could not love it more! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, me too! What do you love about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I'm ready to start my own restaurant now <endOfText>
<human> How exciting!  What kind of restaurant to you want to open? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's going to be a Korean! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds amazing! We need a Korean restaurant in our town, I would love for one to open here! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma died 15 years ago this week.  I really miss her. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad. Did she live a happy and fulfilled life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog peed on the rug for the near hundredth time today. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet!  Did you take him outside? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend's mom decided to go back to school at 50. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow nice! its never too late. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a while back my manager had told me i would most likely get a promotion within the next few weeks. <endOfText>
<human> That's great news! You must be excited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son won his first little league game today! I was so stoked! <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud and happy! What a young athelete in the making <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at my sister in law. You just wait until I tell you what she's done! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to eat at my favorite restaurant tomorrow. I am really looking forward to going <endOfText>
<human> I bet your excited about it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite restaurant closed down. I'd go so often after work <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe you can find a similar place around you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently watching professional bowling and I was struck by how good the players are. They make getting strikes look so easy! <endOfText>
<human> I know! Then you get to the bowling alley, try to do what they do, end up getting 3 gutter balls in a row, and fall flat on your butt to boot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to give a big speech in class tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, are you nervous about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was studing for a test yesterday and really trying to concentrate <endOfText>
<human> How did that go? Studying is very important in order to do good.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How did that go? Studying is very important in order to do good. <endOfText>
<human> yea , but my girlfriend was beside be and she was flicking her fingers and nails up and down over and over against the wooden table we were at.  can you imagine this when I need perfect silence for studying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How annoying that could be. She could have alittle more respect for you. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly but i acrd the test ant way . but i can still hear those finger nails click, click, click , click <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How frustrating! I hope you were able to study just a little though. <endOfText>
<human> I was and i passed the test and I'm looking for a new girlfriend <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate hasn't washed his dishes in weeks. I am so horrified of the smell when I go into the dang kitchen. <endOfText>
<human> You should definitely change roommates. I had been through such experience and know how more difficulty he can bring. Stay away from irresponsible people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My close friend whom I know for years and with whom i hang out a lot for fun is moving away to a different state. I feel lonely and don't know with whom to spend time if he is gone <endOfText>
<human> That really stinks. Is there any way you'll be able to keep up with him to ease the sadness? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My prized, Argentinian goldfish died yesterday. I've never been so heartbroken. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no I am so sorry to hear that!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you for the condolences, friend. He used to sing me such sweet lullabies when I was trying to fall asleep. I don't know how I will ever get any sleep at night now. <endOfText>
<human> I can't imagine how much that much hurt. I hope you can at least cherish the memories you had together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no I am so sorry to hear that! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for the condolences, friend. He used to sing me such sweet lullabies when I was trying to fall asleep. I don't know how I will ever get any sleep at night now.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel ready to cook tonight! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! What so happens to be on the Master Chef's menu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was totally freaking out when I heard this crazy noise from the dumpster! <endOfText>
<human> I would have been running away. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a new store to check it out. I was really pleased with what I saw. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice. What type of stuff does the store sell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole some candy from the store. I felt so bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Did this happen recently?  Did you take it back and admit the error? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were supposed to go out of town for labor day but we had to cancel. <endOfText>
<human> That really sucks. Is it because your mom was in the hospital? I am a psychic, so I tend to know these things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some ice cream after a hard day's work today. It was so refreshing. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, ice cream really hits the spot when you're tired.  Especially when it's hot in the summer time like this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I made the decision that I would stay home with our kids. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I bet your are excited about this <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is off to her mom's. I will be alone and lonely without her <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How boring. Could you call up a few buddies to hang out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. I was livid! <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible. Were you able to get it up before it stained? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was livid when the pizza delivery guy showed up with only one of the pizzas we ordered for a party. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Did you tell him to go back and get the other one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped on the rug today. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did your dog have to go really bad or what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my final math exam tomorrow. I have been studying all week! <endOfText>
<human> Are you ready for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend got me a new puppy today! <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing. What a lovely and caring partner you have. You must be a happy person. Was it for any special occasion or just a surprise gift? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For the last couple of month, I had been consistently paying off my credit card debts. I hope that my credit score would start going up again <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear, friend! I've been trying to work off my debt as well. Once it's done, I'm going to chop those things up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son won the gold medal conducted in his school. I am so happy about it <endOfText>
<human> You must be so proud, but what was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a father, i couldn't be more proud. He won it for swimming competition. <endOfText>
<human> He must have worked really hard and it paid off. Good for him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My niece made me a bouquet of flowers from her garden. I was not expecting it at all. <endOfText>
<human> That would have been a pleasant surprise!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was even more special because she grew the flowers herself. <endOfText>
<human> you got a special niece. So talented and Kind. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let out a moist, hot, smelly, loud fart in front of all my co-workers today. I don't think I can ever show my face again. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. I hope you can find a new job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cheated on my math exam today. I felt so bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, do you think your teacher will find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so afraid to go on my first roller coaster this year. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have fun? It's always great to face your fears! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped today while walking up the stairs and I know everyone behind me saw me. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so embarrassing! Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I'm fine. I laughed at myself and I think that's the best way to approach embarrassing moments sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you're okay and you laughed it off. Just be careful the next time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting. What was it and did you cry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was getting ready for work when my boss called and said I could take the day off with pay. He made my heart sing I was so happy. <endOfText>
<human> How nice of him! How did you earn such an honorable gesture? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They had been doing some remodeling over the weekend but didn't finish in time to open. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, well, I hope you enjoyed it! I am sure that won't happen often. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son said his first word today! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome!!! What was the word? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know what really grinds my gears??? <endOfText>
<human> What really grinds your gears, friend? Rotten potatoes? Beverly hillbillies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog pooped in my neighbors law. It is becoming a habit for him <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was your neighbor upset about it.I bet your embarrassed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my sister after a long time. Unknowingly i got tears in my eyes <endOfText>
<human> I am sure they were happy tears.  How long had it been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was having a great day.  That was until some jerk rear ended me on the way home. <endOfText>
<human> omg. Driving skills are going down nowadays. You must very angry about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so gosh darn mad when my favorite show, the Beverly Hillbillies, got canceled! <endOfText>
<human> Oh me TOO!!!!  That and Hee Haw both!  How did you cope? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're taking the kiddos to the amusement park this weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Sounds like a wonderful time. Which one you taking them to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor returned my treasured lawn gnome today. <endOfText>
<human> Wow you must be so happy about it.  <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My son cheated on his math exam today. I've never felt so let down. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I bet your disappointed in his actions! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At the school honor roll program my niece was given a special recognition award for being such a good helper to her teacher. I thought my heart would burst, I was really feeling it. <endOfText>
<human> Good Job to her! I bet you were so proud of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man.  I heard something crash behind my house. <endOfText>
<human> That is never good.  Did you go out and check on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went skydiving for the first time the other day.  I froze right before getting ready to jump. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice!  Did you have fun?  Did you finally jump? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend got me a pet toad today! <endOfText>
<human> Do you like toads? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like the new paint job on my house. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. What color did you paint it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the skating rink all by myself today because my friends ditched me. <endOfText>
<human> That's disappointing. I'm glad that you didn't let that stop you, and that you still went out and had a good time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking on the road. I saw a beggar and i didn't help him. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's kinda mean <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my co-worker's cake, which was in the fridge <endOfText>
<human> haha, was that intentional to get revenge on him/her. or just that you were hungry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to pull up on the internet pictures from where I lived as a kid. I felt like I was right back there. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am really excited to get this package that I had ordered a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> What did you order? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I get into law school. <endOfText>
<human> It takes a lot of discipline to get prepared for the LSAT exam and apply to schools. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so upset my girlfriend dumped me. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear, Why did she do this to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog will have a surgery soon <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what's wrong with your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma was just transferred to hospice care. <endOfText>
<human> That is bad news, hope you go visit her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Her and I have always been so close. I am devastated. <endOfText>
<human> Make sure you visit her every day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for the summer to be gone. <endOfText>
<human> Why?  Don't like the hot weather? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man.  You know what really grinds my gears?? <endOfText>
<human> What is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This STUPID printer we have at work!!!!  I hate it hate it HATE it!!! <endOfText>
<human> You should throw it out the window. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My weekend plan is cancelled due to the weather. It sucks <endOfText>
<human> That's never fun. hope you can find something else to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling a little down since my wife will be gone for the weekend. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. What are you going to do to keep yourself busy all weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my friends are going on a road trip. I think it will go well <endOfText>
<human> Where will you be heading? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish my fish was still alive. <endOfText>
<human> That's sad, when did it died? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We almost lose our house last month <endOfText>
<human> What happened to make that almost happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really appreciate all my friends I have. <endOfText>
<human> Friends are so useful and nice to have on happy and sad days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes my partner can sleep for over 24 hours, it is so crazy. <endOfText>
<human> That is a long time, has he gone to a doctor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My exams are next week and i have prepared very well. i think it will go smooth <endOfText>
<human> All you can do is prepare the best you can. After that there's not much else you can do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching an old movie and when it came to the sad part it made me cry. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you are sentimental i guess!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am trying to decide if I want to move in with my fiancee before the wedding. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah that is a really big step. Have you guys talked about it yet/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my friend's house recently and it was horrific. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible! What happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds terrible! What happened? <endOfText>
<human> It was just so dirty inside. Like he never cleaned it at all. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I just got a check from a family member who just passed. For 100,000 dollars <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that is a big inheritance. What do you plan to do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so upset after I discovered that half of my take out order was completely missing from the bag! <endOfText>
<human> That sucks! Did you have to go back for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The phone company almost charged my wife 500 dollars for a broken phone she had to return. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Ask for a refund or some extra stuff! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was about 12 years old, I went into a guitar shop and stole some strings. I always felt bad about it. They were cheap, but still, I hate that I did it. <endOfText>
<human> I feel you. I once stole drumsticks. I swear it is something about being a teenager. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to cancel plans for this weekend. I got really sick last night. I feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks, getting sick is the worst. Hope you feel better soon. Take vitamin C, it really does help some people.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that sucks, getting sick is the worst. Hope you feel better soon. Take vitamin C, it really does help some people. <endOfText>
<human> I feel okay now, with a lot of sleep. But I dont want to risk going on a roadtrip. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't drink anymore and I'm careful about new medications. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That's probably a health choice that you've made. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The doctor warned me but I ended up making a fool of myself. <endOfText>
<human> Well, the past is in the past. All you can do now is try your best moving forward. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A couple of years ago, when I was in college, I needed to move several heavy things from my apartment but I didn't have a car. <endOfText>
<human> Did you ask a friend for help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever browse through old photos on a friend's Facebook page? Kinda weird right? <endOfText>
<human> I have. Sometimes it's nice to see what old friends have been up to, and what new friends have done. I don't think it's too strange. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After failing inspection, my friend offered to repair the required parts of my car with his own tools, I was confident he could do so for significantly cheaper than the garage. <endOfText>
<human> He charged you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Only for the required parts. He did the labor for free! I tipped him though, of course. <endOfText>
<human> Did it all work out? Or did he completely mess up your car hah <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He took the car to his own mechanic and it passed the inspection no problem. Probably saved about $500. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you've got a lot of faith in your friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I finished reading one of my favorite books from when I was a teenager. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really?! I love to read! What book was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lent my co-worker $200 today so she could pay her rent. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of you. I have been in that place, where I needed help, and was incredibly grateful to those who helped. How did it make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so lucky to have such good kids. I can let them do what they want and not have to worry much. <endOfText>
<human> I do not have children YET, But hopefully in the future. as long as they are easy to handle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm just getting older and older. I feel so far away from my childhood when things felt so very open ended. <endOfText>
<human> REALLY.. OLD AGE IS A PART OF OUR LIFE.. BETTER ENJOY THAN FEELING SAD <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> SOMETIMES IT IS SAD TO SEE SOME POOR PEOPLE .. DO YOU AGREE <endOfText>
<human> I do agree. It seems like more and more people are going through rough times these days. Nobody wants to do anything about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> YES.. WORSE YET.. SOME ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THEIR BASIC NEEDS.. <endOfText>
<human> A lot of people say they care about these issues but I'd like to see more people put their money where there mouth is. We do live in a society. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been taking martial arts classes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds so fun, do you have a black belt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Exactly the other day I had to do a demo in front of the class and I was partnered with someone who doesn't like me. <endOfText>
<human> That is the worst, I always hated school when they would make you stand up in front of the class and do things, even worse when you have to do it with someone you are not friends with! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I understand that, I don't even like going to the gym, because I feel like people are always watching me and it makes me feel awkward. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly the other day I had to do a demo in front of the class and I was partnered with someone who doesn't like me.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got this email about winning and iPhone and fell for it, I sent them the information they asked for <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened once they got your information? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first dog died a year ago. He was only 4 years old. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry for your loss. How did he die if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my son was born, the doctors thought he was having seizures. He had to stay in the NICU and his life was in the doctors hands. Thankfully, he has been fine ever since and perfectly healthy. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was so scary for you! Did they find out what was wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Actually, they think he was just a really big baby and had low sugar.. <endOfText>
<human> That's a relief! I'm glad to hear that he is doing great now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling a bit nervous today. I'm selling an appliance on Craigslist and I have someone coming over to look at it. <endOfText>
<human> Nervous about the person or nervous that they won't take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I was in Barcelona a month or so ago and had an early flight to Rome. I was catching a bus at 4am and this car comes out of nowhere and offered me and the other 3 people there a ride to the airport for 12 euro. It didn't even look like a cab. Sketchy. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! That would be really scary!! I hope you didn't get in the car! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last Monday I lost my keys at  the mall and couldn't find them. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been so stressful. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just had a giant storm roll through this week. So much rain and lightning. The ground got so saturated that a tree fell down in my yard. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I hope it didn't cause a lot of damage, I have a bunch of very tall trees in my yard as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my ID in a friend's car a few days ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I've done that, I hate when that happens. Are you going to see them again soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took in a kitten 2 months ago. I have been bottle feeding and raising her by hand. <endOfText>
<human> Awww! How sweet! I love kittens, but it sounds like a lot of work! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling so regretful today. I went shopping and spent way more than I should have. I think I might have to return some of the things I bought. <endOfText>
<human> I hate that feeling. I spent $50 on groceries I didn't exactly need. so I know how you feel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking about giving my savings to a friend who is opening a business to manage investments. <endOfText>
<human> Could turn out good, Could turn out bad. How well do you know your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My recent relationship, I wasn't concerned about my partner cheating. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's good, you both must have had a very trusting relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to learn to be more calm and understand that there around people around me who love me and are supporting me. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, sometimes we take those who care about us for granted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had to move, but my landlord couldn't let me bring my pets in. I left them in the care of a friend. Theyre very trusting but I am still worried. <endOfText>
<human> That's understandable, no one knows your pets like you do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to get my girlfriend a birthday present. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope everything is ok! Was she mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I lay in bed with my kitties at night. All of my problems fall away. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet. I love cats, but I'm allergic to them so we can't have any. It makes me sad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost killed my poor little betta fish one time. <endOfText>
<human> What? How? Is it OK now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really sick and couldn't clean the bowl. he got fin rot. he is good now though. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's good news at least! i Hope you are better too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to put my cat to sleep last week. It was so hard. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my God, that's horrible. I'm really sorry to hear that. I hope you're doing okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so heartbroken! He was old, sick and in pain, so it was time. It doesn't make it easier though! <endOfText>
<human> Nothing can really replace a loved pet you had for a long time, all you have is memories really. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know where my life is heading right now, but I believe that God knows the desires of my heart and he will get me there. <endOfText>
<human> It's important to have faith that things will work out the way they should! I'm a strong believer in that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone brought me flowers this morning. It was very nice but I don't have a vase or anything. <endOfText>
<human> You can always use and old mason jar wrapped in some hemp fiber <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally have some stability in my life for the first time in a long time. It feels very good to be able not to worry about much... For now. <endOfText>
<human> It's always a good thing to be able to focus on things that don't have to do with money.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's always a good thing to be able to focus on things that don't have to do with money. <endOfText>
<human> Yes indeed. I just found a new place to live, got a car for a good deal, and have been doing well at my new job. I am sorry for bragging, I just feel really good about things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend want to buy a house but I think the housing bubble is going to burst again. <endOfText>
<human> you know sometimes it is hard to predict something like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah, I just don't want to be one of the unlucky one's <endOfText>
<human> but if you don't buy now, as the prices go higher, you will regret it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend who helped me a great deal when my husband and I separated and I could not deal with him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that but I'm glad you have a good friend!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I'm sorry to hear that but I'm glad you have a good friend! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks, she helped a lot in that situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to see a concert at the end of the month. <endOfText>
<human> Exciting, what concert? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They are a coverband of a band from the 80s. <endOfText>
<human> That would be so nice, I have not went to a concert in ages <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son really wanted a bow and arrow, but I could not afford to get him one <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. We always want to give our kids the things they want. I'm sure he'll understnad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently started seeing a lady and I want to be committed to her to help build our relationship. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds nice, have you had trouble in the past staying committed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been feeling a bit nervous about my next decisions in life. How do I know what the right thing to do is? <endOfText>
<human> I know exactly what you mean. It's really tough but when I make decisions I try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I feel that I have more people around me that want to drive me like a horse rather than love me as a son. But, I guess that's not true. It's just my feelings. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it can be true. Don't be taken for a run  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes it can be true. Don't be taken for a run <endOfText>
<human> In many circumstances, I feel as though I'm confused by situations in my life. I hope that everything turns out for the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man I can't wait to give my mother in law her house back. I just got a new place but have to wait a week to move in. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my old dog, I was thinking about getting another one but I'm not sure. <endOfText>
<human> How long has it been since you had your old dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently quit a really bad job, but I didn't have another job lined up <endOfText>
<human> I lost my job, so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job, so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income. <endOfText>
<human> It definitely is. It took a huge leap of faith <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the past, I was given a loving home with parents that helped me and a career path I could have succeeded on, and I blew it. <endOfText>
<human> It's never to late to continue on that path or find a new one. Same happened here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My storage unit got robbed while I was moving to a new home. They took all my family antiques and precious items. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. I don't know what's up with this world anymore, it seems like things are always getting worse. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know it's very petty of me but it is starting to bug me. My family has been very generous towards my adult sister as of late but have not really paid much attention to me. <endOfText>
<human> Have you tried talking to them about this?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you tried talking to them about this? <endOfText>
<human> This has happened on and off for years, and I always try to talk to them. I usually get no response. It's led me to be self-sufficient fortunately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember a time where I was asked to help out with a kids camp as a volunteer and it was about 2 months ahead of time, so I completely forgot about it and ended up not going <endOfText>
<human> Did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence? I hope there were no hard feelings! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife's out of town right now on business. She has to go on these trips a few times a year. I miss her a lot. <endOfText>
<human> That's completely understandable. Have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to find some Blue Bell ice cream on sale the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me. I've never heard of Blue Bell though, is it any good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh boy I am livid! I just got this new couch from my family and my cats have already shredded an entire side of it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things. <endOfText>
<human> Agreed. We forget that they're small animals. Their brains aren't that big! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my boyfriend make all or most of our decisions. <endOfText>
<human> And is he okay with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really down this morning. I saw a treehouse on the side of the road and it made me remember mine. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's been a rough day! My water heater is busted. Fortunately I got a plumber coming in that can fix it over the weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Dang that's a definite mood killer. At least you've got a fix on the way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know what will happen in the future if Global Warming is not stopped. <endOfText>
<human> Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn't good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really screwed up today! I was working on a big pot of pit beef, followed the old family recipe, and it tastes like garbage! <endOfText>
<human> Odd! Any idea where you went wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kids grow up so fast, It seem like yesterday when mine were babies. <endOfText>
<human> How old are they now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oooo I was not feeling that good earlier in the week. I made some egg salad and I guess I didn't cook it right because I got very ill. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when my grandma was sick and we the grandchildren took turns keeping her company and helping her with whatever she needed. <endOfText>
<human> You guys sound like great grand kids, I bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I went on a road trip this summer. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like fun!  Did you enjoyed it? How far did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a very busy week for me, but now that the weekend is here I'm looking forward to relaxing at home. <endOfText>
<human> Why has your week been so busy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I went to the supermarket with some old clothes I wear around the house not expecting to meet anyone I know, but I met my boss and his wife. <endOfText>
<human> yikes! That must have caught you off guard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I ate my husband's leftovers, even though I knew he was looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did he take it okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview yesterday and it went great, so I'm expecting for them to call soon. <endOfText>
<human> I'm in the same boat. I'm so happy to hear that and I hope you get the job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In two weeks I'll be back teaching with a brand new group of kids. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited for the new group? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just dyed my hair for the first time by myself. I had to watch a lot of videos to make sure I knew how to do it. <endOfText>
<human> Must be hard when you can't physically see what you are doing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat tore apart my favorite book this morning <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that sucks! What book? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently rewatched on of my favorite childhood movies. <endOfText>
<human> Oh the nostalgia of watching old movies. What movie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went skydiving a few weeks ago. It was certainly an exercise in trust. <endOfText>
<human> I used to want to do that so bad when I was younger. Was it amazing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a lot of hours at work for next month. I hope I can use it to move to a new apartment <endOfText>
<human> That's a great goal to set for yourself. Where do you work if I may ask? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first time I went on a motorcycle, I was scared. But I knew my husband wouldn't do anything to hurt me. I trusted him with my life. <endOfText>
<human> It must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone, and motorcycles can be fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job in a few weeks and I'm nervous, I hope I'll like it. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I've been there, I bet you like it!  Especially after you get used to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks! Change is always hard. But I am looking forward to new challenges. <endOfText>
<human> That is such a great attitude! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid, I watched Psycho at a sleepover on Halloween. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrifying! I bet you didn't sleep that night! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to borrow money from my parents to pay the mortgage. I am having trouble making ends meet. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that,  I hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks I hope so too. I recently took on a second part time job so that should help. These are tough times for a lot of people. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I know.  It hasn't been easy for me either, but I believe think will go our way pretty soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine recently met George Clooney at a restaurant and posted a picture with him on Instagram! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's so exciting! I bet he's a nice guy in real life.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that's so exciting! I bet he's a nice guy in real life. <endOfText>
<human> Yes she even spoke to him for while!  I wish it was me, I love the guy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are really wanting wanting to buy a newer and bigger vehicle, but we're not sure if we can afford it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used, or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75% less than what I would've paid from a car dealer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate a whole gallon of ice cream by myself in one sitting and now I'm not feeling too happy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I could do that if I didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I'm telling myself that its okay since it was just a one time thing. I'll walk it off tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Lol, burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I was so stupid to believe this... <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend.  I knew he cheated on me but he said he wouldn't do it again. <endOfText>
<human> Well, you gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was his decision to cheat.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, you gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was his decision to cheat. <endOfText>
<human> True. Makes me feel so dumb though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle volunteered to fix my car. I was going to take it to the dealership. <endOfText>
<human> That's kind of him! Is he good at that sort of thing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love looking at old photos. Makes me miss the good old days. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, even ones from 5 or 6 years ago! Especially ones of the kids. <endOfText>
<human> I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I, they get teary-eyed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in a wedding party tomorrow, and I've been called upon to give a big toast during the reception. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's such an honor.  How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thinking about a friend of mine who passed away a few years ago.  Then I found some letters that he had written me. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you. I'm sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe I thought I'd get away with this... <endOfText>
<human> Get away with what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm doing awful in math class. We had an assignment and I found some of the answers in the back of the book. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get caught using them?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I went to a bachelorette weekend with my girl friends. All of them were doing things their husbands would NOT be happy with, but I stayed far away from anything like that. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear! What happened!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work assigned to a project on a team. <endOfText>
<human> How did that go? Do you like that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How did that go? Do you like that? <endOfText>
<human> Well. I ended up taking someone's work and passing it off as my own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My spouse had a brief affair last year. It ended and we are still together. <endOfText>
<human> Who was it with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A co-worker. <endOfText>
<human> Were you more mad at them or your spouse? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I was so shaking in my boots. I was sitting outside on my patio and saw a shadowy figure inside my house! <endOfText>
<human> What was it?  Did everything turn out alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got in big trouble at school.  He was very mean to his best friend, and I had to call his mom and explain what had happened. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible when friends fight. What was it over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> New neighbors moved in this week, and they have a dog that looks almost exactly like my childhood dog. <endOfText>
<human> How interesting.  How does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I wish I could clear my closet out but I just can't part with these things. <endOfText>
<human> I felt the same way as you, but what's the point of keeping things you don't use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't use it but I've collected so many little things in memory boxes. It's really grown to a few boxes now. <endOfText>
<human> So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them, but at the end of the day, they are just items! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt the same way as you, but what's the point of keeping things you don't use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet? <endOfText>
<human> I don't use it but I've collected so many little things in memory boxes. It's really grown to a few boxes now.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father sent me a photo of a letter I wrote for his birthday when I was a kid. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how sweet! What did it say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love finding treasures like that! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I'm glad he kept them because it's always amazing to find it later in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I signed up to do a lot of food for a family reunion next weekend. I have to start getting supplies now for sure! <endOfText>
<human> That is a lot of work! But I bet the reunion will be fun.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a lot of work! But I bet the reunion will be fun. <endOfText>
<human> My family's reunions are incredibly memorable. I volunteered for a lot of desserts so I think it's fair to get started this weekend. I want to be ready. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's one of my faves. My go to is cheesecake. <endOfText>
<human> I love cheesecake, I should do that as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a nurse and I take care of people in the last stage of their lives. <endOfText>
<human> Is that like hospice care? How do you deal with seeing loss so frequently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it is. It's really tough. I never stop caring about the loss. It's hard. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's the best part. Some people are in so much pain it's a relief for them to go. Hard on the families though. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it is. Thank you for giving your time to this type of work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to make a patty melt today and my bread was moldy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, my mom invited me and my kids on a road trip. <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting. Is that something you want to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was totally comfortable last night watching a movie with my boyfriend and eating popcorn. <endOfText>
<human> Really, did you get to pick the movie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I had a really cute girl hit on me <endOfText>
<human> That's always nice, how did you respond? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told her I had a girlfriend but was flattered <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, nothing wrong with being faithful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This has been such a great summer so far. I just got a new job in June and I bought a new set of wheels this week! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, jobs are ok, but a new ride is really fun. What did you get <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking to my boss and used a word that I didn't know the real meaning of. made a total fool of myself. lol <endOfText>
<human> Wow, was it embarrassing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We've moved a lot of the past decade for my husband's job. <endOfText>
<human> oh really, hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just put some snow tires up for sale on the internet. I stopped using Craigslist awhile ago because of some bad experiences so I hope it goes okay. <endOfText>
<human> As long as you're safe about it. You can meet up at police stations too!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As long as you're safe about it. You can meet up at police stations too! <endOfText>
<human> That was my mistake in the past. I always went to weird locations to exchange things. I have to be smart about it nowadays. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been married to the same person for over 34 years <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That's a long time. Longer than I've been alive! Congrats on your successful marriage. Got any tips? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks for the advice. I have trouble letting the petty things go but I think I'll learn to be better as time goes by. I wish you a happy marriage! <endOfText>
<human> Thanks! You can do it! With the right person, it's not as hard as it seems. So I guess the real secret is to find the right person from the start. ;) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My heart sank when I heard about my favorite teacher from elementary school passing away. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhhh, that's so sad. I remember (long ago) when that happened to me. Did he/she live a good long life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to past a test next week but since I am well prepared I believe I will have no trouble doing it. <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I decided we wanted a night to ourselves, but we've never let our son stay the night anywhere. I was pretty nervous. <endOfText>
<human> How old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've spent at least an hour a day on overwatch for the past 3 months. Altogether I have roughly 90 hours this season <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I enjoy watching Overwatch on Twitch occasionally. Would you say that's your favorite game? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never got into COD and I tried Overwatch when it first came out but I wasn't very good. Fortnite on the other hand I'm alright at. <endOfText>
<human> Overwatch is a team oriented game, just try your est to communicate and use strategies, while also self improving and you will climb. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently renovated my home and it's so nice to be done with all the work! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What did you have done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are going camping next weekend and I have all the equipment to do it right, <endOfText>
<human> Make sure to bring smores and bug spray. I hate bug bites. and love chocolate  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Make sure to bring smores and bug spray. I hate bug bites. and love chocolate <endOfText>
<human> Yes I have all of that plus everything else we will be needing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved back near family, and I'm feeling overwhelmed with how close knit everything is again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I feel you! Every time I go back to stay with my family it feels... claustrophobic almost. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go get my tooth pulled soon. I hate the dentist <endOfText>
<human> What's wrong with your tooth? I hope it's not too painful of an experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother told me that he won a 75" TV from work. He says it looks good with his new Xbox! <endOfText>
<human> Interest are you going to try and get him to sell it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am old enough to remember the times before internet and social media when people you spoke over the phone or in person. <endOfText>
<human> Same. When you had one phone in the middle of the house with the SUPER long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife's grandmother passed on a couple weeks ago. It's still eating at me to think about it. <endOfText>
<human> Were you close to your wife's grandmother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daily life consists of getting up, going to work or going to college. I miss being young and spending my day playing videogames and playing outside <endOfText>
<human> Those times seemed much simpler didn't they? Do you ever break out of the routine? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Even when it has been a rough year, I am now feeling that things are beginning to go my way and I can expect good thing for the future. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Anything exciting on the horizon to treat yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't slept well this week at all. The county has been drilling outside my house for 12 hours a day. <endOfText>
<human> Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really though I was going to be accepted in med school, but I wasn't. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting to hear back from the nursing program I applied to for my degree <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting and nerve wracking at the same time I bet. How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm much better off now but I just got out of a time of my life where I was isolated out in a rural area away from a lot of people. <endOfText>
<human> that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss is coming for dinner tonight with his wife. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's exciting. Are you nervous to have them over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just got a new puppy, a real water dog. We have been trying to get it to swim and today he did for the first time! <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's so cute! Was it tough trying to get it to swim? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I was running in the road in a very lonely place and a car began to follow me slowly. <endOfText>
<human> That's so creepy and scary. What happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter snuk out the window last night. <endOfText>
<human> What for? I hope it wasn't for anything dangerous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to lose wait and I'm trying to eat less, but just a few minutes ago a had some sugar cravings and ate a whole package of cookies. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year I was about to run my first 50 mile race.  I had broken my toes a few weeks before and wasn't sure I was going to make it. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, that's unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid I threw a rock at a boy. It hit him on the forehead and made a big gash. I felt so bad about doing it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you get in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through my old family album and realized I had a really good childhood. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that you're away from it. I'm happy that you have that realization. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and some old guy bought my groceries for me. It helped restore my faith in humanity <endOfText>
<human> God's Plan! Do you know why he did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied endlessly for my biology final, and while I was taking the test, I felt good about my responses <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Such a satisfying feeling!  Did you get a good grade? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is finally settled down in one place after moving around a lot. <endOfText>
<human> That's really good news. It must be frustrating to move from place to place constantly. Is your family happy with the place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love walking my dogs on these late summer mornings. It's still cool, the sun is shining, and I still have two more weeks off. <endOfText>
<human> Amen. What kind of dogs do yo have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A boston terrier and a chihuhua cross. <endOfText>
<human> Aw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Most of the time, until we see another dog. <endOfText>
<human> That's about how mine is. He is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder. I found using a harness has helped. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new school semester starts in a few days and I have all of my supplies ready! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great! Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a dog on the side of the road that had been hit by a car, it was so sad <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness. That must have been traumatic to see. Do you know what happened to the dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe that most people are good people, deep down. <endOfText>
<human> I agree with that. I always try to give the benefit of the doubt at first. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On the best of days, yes! I love it though. <endOfText>
<human> Im sure it can be highly rewarding too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bad storm with a tornado almost went through my town, I was so scared <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad it's over and nothing happened. do you have an underground shelter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am saving up my money to buy a home next year sometime. I think it can happen. <endOfText>
<human> Are you excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I return to work in September to a new role. I'm excited but anxious. <endOfText>
<human> congratulations! that is exciting. How long have you been waiting for this. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got the new role in June, so not too long. It's within my organization. <endOfText>
<human> Very cool. I wish you all the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh cool. That must be quite liberating. <endOfText>
<human> started out slow but now it is! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up this morning to find that my dog pooped on my brand new rug! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Not the old pop on the rug trick. Did you yell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww I like those. He is a little shitzu. <endOfText>
<human> Oh cute! What a devil.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What kind of dog? I have a boston terrier. She's the cutest. <endOfText>
<human> Aww I like those. He is a little shitzu.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh cute! What a devil. <endOfText>
<human> yep, spoiled little brat he is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the fair, and I spilled my drink all over myself <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you have to go home and change? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a very committed spouse. I have been married 15 years. <endOfText>
<human> That is so cool! Im not married yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> DO you think you'll ever want to get married? Marriage can be hard. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe, im not sure yet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so badly today because my son overheard me yelling and cursing out his dad because he was late picking up our son.  I didn't mean for him to overhear that but I was really angry. <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's tough!  Have you talked to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't had a chance yet since he's still with his dad.  I hope to call him later tonight. <endOfText>
<human> It might have upset him but I'm sure he'll understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We're waiting to see what size my husband's bonus will be.  This is the first year he's eligible for anything bigger than a Starbucks gift card lol <endOfText>
<human> I hope it's a lot more than just a gift card but at least Starbucks should be a lot of money because it's so expensive there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger, my best friend and I worked together.  She ended up getting the promotion that we both wanted. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry that must have been tough.  She probably felt bad for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbours just bought a new car and put in a pool. I feel like I just can't get ahead- I can barely pay the bills. <endOfText>
<human> Ok,thats lovely <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For them it is, I guess. <endOfText>
<human> Its shows a lot of care <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to walk bare footed to a point <endOfText>
<human> A point of what? Like, of land? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone at my work missed part of their shift due to a personal issue, but requested I withhold any information that would reveal they missed such time <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They are too good to me <endOfText>
<human> hi friend who is too good to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the chance to look through my girlfriend's phone while I was in the shower, I decided not to because I felt I could respect her privacy <endOfText>
<human> Thats so cool of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have to make an expensive repair to our car. <endOfText>
<human> I know! That must be frustrating. Do you have enough money to cover it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to go out but I couldn't take my small kids. I hadn't ever had a babysitter but I knew my sister would take good care of them. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger! <endOfText>
<human> They did great. I knew I was worried for nothing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my friends signed up for horse back riding lessons but I'd never been before and was scared.  They convinced me to sign up and take them! <endOfText>
<human> It does sound like fun, though. Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If we can believe and trust in each other,the world will be a better place <endOfText>
<human> True. Easier said than done though. How can we be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a c-section scheduled to have my baby. I was very excited about seeing her but very nervous about the surgery. <endOfText>
<human> Did  you layer had the surgery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the surgery and everything went great. I was glad it was over! <endOfText>
<human> Oh,congrats dear <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some of my collegues wete sacked by the management <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! That must have been upsetting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an okay job, not a great job but it paid well, working as a commercial truck and trailer repair technician. After a few weeks on the job I fell into a deep depression after getting injured at work. <endOfText>
<human> oh I am so sorry, I am assuming the injury was serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i farted in a barnes and noble once and someone smelled it. <endOfText>
<human> Hasn't everyone done so at some point? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through pictures of when my kids were young. I can't believe how tiny they were. It made me remember the times when they were tiny. <endOfText>
<human> oh my gosh that's so cute! I bet they were the cutest. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were so sweet and little. Time passes so quickly. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure it does, I don't have any of my own but I would be really sentimental. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am worried about going back to school, I don't know if I should do it. It can be hard. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Don't let fear stop you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent 2 hours helping my daughter with her homework. I found out today she never turned it in. <endOfText>
<human> Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just went on my break after a long morning at work, so I got chipotle. As soon as I stepped out of my car with my food, I dropped my bowl on the floor <endOfText>
<human> oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is good to remain faithful if you are married. Faith and trust are important in a healthy relationship. <endOfText>
<human> I am completely agree.  How long have you been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my glasses so I had to wear an old pair that had visible scratches on the lenses from being stored in a drawer. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks.  I hate having scratched glasses <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going through a breakup, we were together for five years I am heartbroken <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever have a situation where you help someone out and just end up regretting it? <endOfText>
<human> yes, that is always a hard situation.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes, that is always a hard situation. <endOfText>
<human> Yea, I once let this guy crash on my couch rent free for 3 months, and the entire time he was taking money out my room and eating my snacks without saying anything. I knew things were missing, but he'd always deny it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> An old friend wanted to get together. IT was a guy, and he was someone I was involved with. I knew it would bother my husband so I didn't meet with him. <endOfText>
<human> That's the best decision. I know mine wouldn't either. If he is a good guy, he will understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't want to make my husband uncomfortable, even if it would have been nice to catch up. But I have to respect him. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. No sense in rocking the boat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to the dentist really soon. One of my teeth are really sensitive lately. <endOfText>
<human> It is definitely good to get that looked at right away. Then they can take care of it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I know it's hard. Just try to relax and it will go quick. <endOfText>
<human> I will make myself go. thanks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have meditated nearly every day this year. It was my new years resolution. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Did it help you become less stressed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, I'm not sure if I could do that. Did you feel scared? <endOfText>
<human> Scared of what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont like borrowing from people <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my son to clean the kitchen. He left dirty dishes in the sink and garbage on the counter. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats not good..sometimes teenagers can be alittle messy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you like theme park rides? I used to enjoy them a lot, but one time my ride got stuck. <endOfText>
<human> I think theme park rides are scary! Was it scary when you were stuck? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They are really good about that. They have a lot of safety features you don't even realize. We were stuck on Space Mountain once. <endOfText>
<human> Jeeze, man. I wonder how many other people have gotten stuck on rides before. Is it that common of an occurrence? Well, we're both here to talk about it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When he was little, my nephew was so adorable. He was the first child in the family for a long time, and he was so cute. I loved to spend time with him. <endOfText>
<human> Awww, you're speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Intuition can be a key tool to a seasoned nurse. <endOfText>
<human> I suppose, but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation, especially when the health of others are in their hands. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Those are very beneficial tools as well but sometimes experience plays a large part in patient outcomes. <endOfText>
<human> That is true. There are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's always such a great feeling whenever I get home and my dog is there waiting for me at the door ready to greet me. <endOfText>
<human> Dogs are wonderful pets. They are so loving and devoted. What kind of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a little havanese named Yoko. <endOfText>
<human> That's an awesome name. I have two feists. If you're not familiar with the breed, they resemble Jack Russell terriers, but they are bred for squirrel hunting. Their names are Whiskey and Ruby. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I want to tell you about one time my faith was tested. Have you ever had a time when you had to just put your faith in God? <endOfText>
<human> all the time I am not sure I believe in God <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat just recently died and I am very shaken up about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I am so sorry! I am an animal lover, too. We have two dogs now, but used to have cats, too. We did have to say goodbyes to some of our pets over years. It's heart breaking... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went over my grandmother's house one holiday. Everyone was spending quality time together and cooking and it was just so special. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a holiday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it was. My family usually is far, but some people came into town. It was just nice to be together. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like a fun event. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost an expensive phone. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is so frustrating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I joined the Army when I was 18 because I didn't know what else to do. I was so nervous! <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you were.  Was boot camp really hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Physically it wasn't too difficult. It was mentally difficult though. <endOfText>
<human> I could never do something like that.  Thank you for your service <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh. My boss called me into his office today...and he didn't even give a reason. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom became very ill recently and had to be hospitalized. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no -- how is she feeling now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, that had to be tough. I'm glad she's doing better now though. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked so hard on my science project in school. I thought I was going to get first place. I didn't and was so upset. <endOfText>
<human> What a bummer! What place did you end up getting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time when i was young and i didn't know how to swim I jumped in the pool knowing my dad was watching me. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get hurt or drown a bit? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I was cooking dinner. I dropped a hotdog on the floor and ended up giving it to my child. <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure hope the hot dog was fit to eat <endOfText>
<human> I rinsed it off. No one saw it but I feel bad about it now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is very trustworthy, he's good at keeping a secret when asked to <endOfText>
<human> That's really good you guys can trust eachother like that. That helps make you both grow in the relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I as not invited for unknown reasons,but i wish to be there <endOfText>
<human> Where were you not invited to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in high school I borrowed my parents car, and got into an accident. Of course like most human teenagers I tried to cover it up but they found out. <endOfText>
<human> Hey,were you injured? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband used to tell me to go to sleep at night when my daughter was born. I didn't want to go to sleep because I didn't want to miss a moment with her. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that is so sweet.  I completely understand why!  Oh and thank you for your apology but I am truly content and have accepted it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband didn't get it. He thought I was crazy. Oh well..... <endOfText>
<human> Men are crazy sometimes!  LOL! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job that requires me to work out of town. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a fun one to me. Are you happy there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They don't make do with what they have <endOfText>
<human> who is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is no better feeling than being greeted at the door by your dog <endOfText>
<human> Thats always a good feeling. I bet you are excited to come home everyday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend i'm going to the beach. It's been so long! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you have a good time and you enjoy it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother went out of town last month and asked me if I would water his plants for him while he was away. <endOfText>
<human> Did you do it? How far does he live from you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes,  it was an embarrassing moment <endOfText>
<human> What happend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! So recently I applied for this barista job. I've been waiting forever for them to get back to me! <endOfText>
<human> They haven't called you back yet? I hate when that happens, they make you wait by the phone on pins and needles! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I've been having an issue with my neighbor. It's not super hairy yet but it could be. They constantly back into my mailbox on their way out almost every day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! Have they broken it? That would drive me nuts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remeber once I had a job where I worked on a farm. I did a lot things their I had never done before in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that sounds intriguing, what new things did you try? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a son who's 8 months old! I get so nostalgic about how quickly time has passing, and it hasn't even been a year! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it's crazy how each year seems to go by faster than the last too, having kids must be surreal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a baby! It was such an incredible feeling seeing his face for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, congrats, what did you end up naming him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! I'm so excited! My husband and I decided to temporarily relocate to Arizona this winter! <endOfText>
<human> sounds exciting. I always wanted to leave my were I was originally from so I could experience and see new things <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you ever had a felling like someting bad was going to happen .Then ignored your instincts? <endOfText>
<human> Oh definitely. Why did you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey dude! I'm so pumped. I just got a beautiful new dress for my friend's wedding. <endOfText>
<human> It's always fun to get new clothes! Is the wedding soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, a few years ago, my husband got a job offer in Hawaii. We LOVE Hawaii, but we didn't know anyone there and you know how expensive it is to live there. We really had to think about that move... <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend joined the airforce and became an air traffic controller. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like some good work experience. How long is he in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A guy asked me on a date one, knowing I was married.  I denied, of course, but was shocked that he didn't care that I was in a monogamous relationship. <endOfText>
<human> That's the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my first professional interview recently! <endOfText>
<human> congrats, how did you handle the pressure? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever feel like time is just going by way too fast? <endOfText>
<human> OMG! especially recently. a week seems like one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been wanting to buy a massage table for my business. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? Are you a massage therapist? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey. How are you? <endOfText>
<human> I'm good, what's up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new town recently and I finally made a new friend! I was starting to feel really lonely so it's nice to feel like I might fit in. <endOfText>
<human> Way to go! If it makes you feel better I would be your friend if I was there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So! My husband's cat pooped and peed in the bathtub today. That was rough. <endOfText>
<human> Hope you didn't take a bath after that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so bummed! My best friend is moving away to Brazil. <endOfText>
<human> Wow Brazil? Isn't there a lot of crime there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 13 I was baptized. In water, not milk. But if I was baptized in milk it would be whole milk. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, how does that make you feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just celebrated my 2 year anniversary! I've been reminiscing about my wedding a lot lately lol. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, too bad I wasn't invited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! Have you been to a rodeo? <endOfText>
<human> No! I think that should be on my bucket list though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't work or really go anywhere. I feel like I'm always waiting. <endOfText>
<human> What are you waiting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good evening! I moved to a small town recently. It's been tough. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks, you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel soo far away from my family. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, I know how that goes. Do they visit often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any cats? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I have one, but they're all over the place it seems like <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was such a nerve wrecking experience when my son was first born, I really was so scared that anything could hurt him! <endOfText>
<human> Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently told me that she couldn't have kids, I tried my hardest to be there for her <endOfText>
<human> Wow that would be terrible news. I can't imaged shit is taking it well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One night my cats were chasing a fly in the house. All of a sudden, one of them started acting weird and then he died. He was only a kitten. I was so upset. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible, I am so sorry, It is hard losing a baby animal, you are not expecting them to pass, like when you have an older sickly one <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life currently, I am able to stay at home with my children and watch them grow, I would not change it for anything <endOfText>
<human> Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out to the bar recently with my girlfriends and it was kind of an annoying experience. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? Did they do or say something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. She recently moved in with my dad. I went and stayed with them to take care of her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, is it difficult to take care of her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never cheated on a girlfriend <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear that you keep your word <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so ashamed the time that I took money from my parents. I couldn't look them in the eyes for weeks when I was younger. <endOfText>
<human> At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took the kids to visit the residents at the Veterans Home. We made some special treats to take to them. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I called in sick to work, so I could go Christmas shopping...they were having a great sale at the mall. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a big pot of Vegetable soup. After eating a big bowl I was completely satisfied and just wanted to nap in my chair. <endOfText>
<human> I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah, It felt so good. <endOfText>
<human> Well I'm happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend is always worrying if I am as happy thought I would be after we decided to go from just good friends to be in a relationship with each other.  I always am honest and tell her the same thing. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend recently lended me their car so I can go out of town <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of them. Did you have any problems with their car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They did not hesitate to lend me the car at all which is nice. No, I did not have any problems with the car. <endOfText>
<human> THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my nephew's car broke down and I loaned him my car, I know that he'll be careful with it. <endOfText>
<human> Well at least you can trust him to be careful.  I dont think I would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females. <endOfText>
<human> The culture that extends adolescence deep into their twenties doesn't help much either.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Long time ago, we saw a driver throw a kitten out of his car window. We picked him up and brought him home. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of you, I would have chased down the car, but you did the right thing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband has a job interview coming up and we re really hoping he'd get the job. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my eye on a pretty new shirt that I wanted to get. My sister got it and it looked great on her. I was so envious. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow i am glad she was happy, why were you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is on her third vacation this year and now she's on a Hawaii cruise! <endOfText>
<human> Boy o-boy bet she is having the time of her life. How many vacations have you taken this year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever invited someone over for dinner that you liked a whole lot? Well I have and it didn't go to well. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> once i pooped my pants at walmart <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on the edge of my seat watching the local election results. I was hoping my candidate would win. <endOfText>
<human> where you disappointed?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> where you disappointed? <endOfText>
<human> No I was quite happy with the results. But the waiting for the results was so nerve wracking. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather forecast called for tropical storm force winds. I made sure that I checked the yard for loose items. <endOfText>
<human> Where do you live? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got caught by the train and it made me late for work. I was so mad. <endOfText>
<human> maybe go earlier later? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it sucked i was heartbroken but i let her go <endOfText>
<human> ... im sorry, how did it happen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that sucks, but hey man it's okay one day you'll find right person <endOfText>
<human> thanks man! i hope you do too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew my wife's family would help us financially for our marriage, turns out it was right, I appreciate it so much. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! The married life is expensive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a time when I really messed up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I behaved immature during the fight lately and lied, later on I felt remorse. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my wife, sadly. I explained to her later and admitted my mistake. <endOfText>
<human> Was she understanding and forgiving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I quit my job without having another one lined up.  I'm hopeful and optimistic that I will be okay and that this was the right choice. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know why my boyfriend lied to me about seeing another woman. I thought he loved me. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think it's possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> really shameful was that I would be the same as I would happen the same <endOfText>
<human> what do you mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate it when you are not sure you can trust someone? <endOfText>
<human> yes i do, that's why i only trust one person, my wife <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, guess what, you will not believe what just happened to me. <endOfText>
<human> What happened to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lately I was sharing memories with my wife from before we got married and it was heartwarming. <endOfText>
<human> Awwe that is so sweet, how did you two meet?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awwe that is so sweet, how did you two meet? <endOfText>
<human> We met online actually! And we were across the ocean from each other. That was a journey. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the good old days when we would be given pancakes on Tuesdays at school. I loved pancake Tuesdays. <endOfText>
<human> Mmm that sounds delicious. There is always time to make pancake Tuesdays at home! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever tried skydiving before? <endOfText>
<human> I haven't, but it's definitely on my bucket list! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I was going to pee my pants until the instructor told me how many years of experience he has under his belt. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing. <endOfText>
<human> yeah, it is. 15 years and over 500 jumps helped ease my anxiety lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How old were you the first time you ever drove a vehicle? <endOfText>
<human> I believe I was fifteen. I drove a soccer mom van! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, but what was even more devastating was that there was a forest fire in the area, so I also ended up losing my house :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh im so sorry! I bet your are devestated! I would be tool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out with the girls and didn't cheat on my bf <endOfText>
<human> Oh okay.... was that even a temptation to begin with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Alrighty then, just seemed like a really weird thing to say. <endOfText>
<human> I know but I'm so proud of myself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been anxious because I think my new landlords don't approve of dogs in the house I'm renting and I have a dog! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is awful! It is against the law where I live to ban animals from the house. So legally I am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no that is awful! It is against the law where I live to ban animals from the house. So legally I am allowed to have a pet even if the contract says no pets allowed. <endOfText>
<human> Really? I did not know such laws exist but it's awesome. Where do you live? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother has been diagnosed with diabetes, so I have been taking care of her diet. I am worried about her health <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. I hope she'll be doing good, she is very lucky to have someone taking care of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The spilled soda echoed so loudly  in the library it was embarrasing <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hopefully you didn't get too many nasty stares! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so annoyed, a coworker of mine was asking me questions about an argument that happened between me and another coworker and I told her what was the problem and then we talked a bout it, I thought she was concerned because I seemed upset but the next day she started telling everyone to make me look like a bad person <endOfText>
<human> I've had a similar experience with a gossiping coworker. It made the workplace such an uncomfortable environment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When moving out of my old family home, I came across a few bags of stuffed animals I had as a kid. Probably 20 animals total. <endOfText>
<human> wow that sure is a lot of stuffed animals, did you play with toys alot at a kid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy, my son has just got into med school! <endOfText>
<human> That's very exciting! I'm sure he put a lot of work towards that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Few years earlier, I was almost going to end a frienship with my frind after hearing that he was talking bad things about me. It was a bad experience after all. Sometimes I share that experience with you guys <endOfText>
<human> did  you end up ending the friendship? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no. I did not believe that and I continued my friendship. <endOfText>
<human> you didn't let anything affect the friendship! that's good i am proud of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am looking forward to my wedding date! Of course you are also invited! :) <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is definitely something to be excited about! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it sure is, I have know Chris since we were 5 years old. I can not believe we have finally come this far and are getting married! <endOfText>
<human> That is quite unique. I'm happy to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped over my foot and landed face first in front of a group of hot jocks. I am so embarrassed! <endOfText>
<human> that must have been so painful, don't get embarrassed it happens to everyone, people fart in public transports, people fall and rip their jeans, people cry over stupid things, it's a totally normal thing  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha, yes you are totally right! I am sure they will forget about it soon :) <endOfText>
<human> you sure will, besides hot jocks doesn't sound too bad too me :3 <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that must have been so painful, don't get embarrassed it happens to everyone, people fart in public transports, people fall and rip their jeans, people cry over stupid things, it's a totally normal thing <endOfText>
<human> Haha, yes you are totally right! I am sure they will forget about it soon :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is  keeping all of my life's savings at her house <endOfText>
<human> Was that your idea? Why did you decide to do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfather passed away, and when I found out it had already been several weeks after the funeral happened. <endOfText>
<human> My condolences to you. Will you be able to visit his gravesite? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately it's a very long ways away. I hope someday too, though. It's important, if only for closure. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it will be worth saving up for. I hope it works out for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my boyfriend with another girl yesterday and they were sitting shoulder to shoulder next to each other...it made me so jealous <endOfText>
<human> I hope that nothing came of it though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know I can pass my calculus test today! <endOfText>
<human> Great confidence! what do you anticipate your grade to be <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am totally going to win first place tomorrow in the biology contest! I studied for months for this! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, I am only worried about missing my school bus to school <endOfText>
<human> why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom passed away it's still so hard <endOfText>
<human> I a so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with your loss?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I a so sorry to hear that. How are you coping with your loss? <endOfText>
<human> Thank you just one day at at a time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, sometimes that is the only thing you can do. I hope you are also getting some support from family and other friends <endOfText>
<human> I am trying to get to that poin <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have all my ingredients ready for the baking contest tomorrow! I am so excited to cook against high class chefs <endOfText>
<human> You sound prepared for it! Im sure you have practiced. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I have I can decorate a cake in less than 30 minutes! :) <endOfText>
<human> Very nice! Keep the confidence and dont doubt yourself tomorrow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi Bob <endOfText>
<human> Hey what is up?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey what is up? <endOfText>
<human> I had an issue with a friend the other day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad, my dog ate my homework that I spend 2 hours on, so now I have to redo the whole thing! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible, what are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guess I will just have to redo everything if my teacher does not believe me :( <endOfText>
<human> Well that's no good, you could try taping it back together <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been married to my husband for 40 years and still love him with all my heart <endOfText>
<human> That's great I always love to hear about happy couples. Too much bad news in the world. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I totally agree, we are celebrating our 41 year anniversary tomorrow :) <endOfText>
<human> Oh, eats lots of cake and make sure to have a nice dinner with candles. Maybe a bubble bath too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello <endOfText>
<human> Hi there, how're you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first night I finally moved into my new place was very nice. I finally had my own spot, to myself, and the means to afford it comfortably. <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want. <endOfText>
<human> It's pretty liberating. Would be hard to come back from that freedom though. Hard to imagine it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally took my friend's food and felt very embarrassed after. <endOfText>
<human> why? what did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hopeful that I will get into law school this year. I studied really hard for it. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do too. Sounds like you did well preparing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I did, I spent 4 hours every day for a whole year studying for this test to get into law school. <endOfText>
<human> Very good! I anticipate you will get in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you do too. Sounds like you did well preparing. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I did, I spent 4 hours every day for a whole year studying for this test to get into law school.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I needed to take my dog to the vet but I couldn't so I asked my sister to go. I am sure she will be able to handle it. <endOfText>
<human> Is your dog ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just ate the most disgusting thing ever! <endOfText>
<human> What did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I misunderstood what someone said to me, I tried to help but in turn it all turned out awkward and the conversation went wrong. <endOfText>
<human> ah i know this feeling, how did the conversation go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was throwing away my old stuff when I came across my old toys but I could not throw them out because they meant so much to me. <endOfText>
<human> You shouldn't be so attached to your old stuff, you might end up a hoarder! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am feeling anxious about my test tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did you study for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am terrified of spiders, one time I saw one on my wall and stared at it for hours to keep track of where it was <endOfText>
<human> What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies, after all.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies, after all. <endOfText>
<human> It's all their legs and eyes...*shivers* just imagining it gives me chills up my spine! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in middle school, I remember seeing a question on the board and feeling positive that I knew the answer. When all was quiet and the teacher asked if anyone knew the answer, I confidently spoke up, only to be incorrect <endOfText>
<human> Oh no how did you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> An odd combination of wanting to die, and not wanting to exist. Like, I basically wanted to reverse time. <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldn't sweat over it, it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to try out a new brand of headphones but instead stuck with the good old Beats. I was loyal to them. <endOfText>
<human> I usually stick with what I know also <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was extremely sick but I had to be at work that day so I had to leave him with my mother in law <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awful. I hope he is better now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so guilty, I promised my friend I would come to her birthday party but forgot about it <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Maybe you can get her a gift and some sweets to make up for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You are brilliant! I can't believe I did not think of that, I will definitely get her some sweets to make it up to her <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully she will understand! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy I just got a new puppy! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome, I bet you're with your puppy all the time now :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes of course! He is the cutest pup, and full of energy! <endOfText>
<human> Puppies are so wonderful, I'm happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw someone who was making much more money than me doing a the same thing as me but a very bad job. But I still wished I was on their place and paid as much <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean, maybe ask if the place is hiring?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know what you mean, maybe ask if the place is hiring? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah well I'm online entrepreneur so it's more complicated. I don't want to charge as much at the same time. They're kind of scamming people but I still felt envious, then got over it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother became sick recently so I have taken some time off work to nurse her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I hope she gets better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a cancer scare last year.  My doctor found a strange mole. I had to wait a week for the biopsy to come back.  It was a long wait! <endOfText>
<human> I can't imagine what that must have felt like. What helped you get through it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At least you kept your sense of humor! <endOfText>
<human> In retrospect!  I was pretty freaked out.  My family was mad at me for not telling them, but I didn't want them to worry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt really guilty when I had to tell my parents I decided to drop out of school. <endOfText>
<human> Did you hear the "You'll be a ditch-digger" speech like my brother did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother got such a nice Snowboard for his birthday when we were teenagers. I wanted one too, but didn't end up getting what I wanted <endOfText>
<human> That doesn't sound like such a pleasurable memory. Maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know, he played it up like that, seemed really invested in the Bass guitar I got. He sure did enjoy the hell out of that snowboard, though. <endOfText>
<human> You know what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm starting a music career professionally and believe I can do it in alternative industry! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, can you tell me more about what you will be doing?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is awesome, can you tell me more about what you will be doing? <endOfText>
<human> Me and my wife are musicians and are forming a duo together with her singing, I play guitar and piano and she sings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> am so impressed by my daughter, she won the national spelling bee contest! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, she must be a talented child! I'm sure you're so proud of her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really am! She is only 7 years old, but already won her first national contest! :) <endOfText>
<human> Now that's an achievement you and her will remember till the rest of her life! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished my last exam and am very relieved to be finished! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! That is always a great feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied my drivers test book page to page for two weeks leading up to the test. Went in with all the confidence in the world <endOfText>
<human> How did that turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Reflecting back on my youth, I remember all the times I'd steal candy bars from the convenience store on the way home from school <endOfText>
<human> haha we all did crazy things when we were young! did you ever get caught? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got to move to the city I've always wanted to live in and I couldn't be happier! <endOfText>
<human> Congratluations! I bet your full of joy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never felt more anticipation than the months I waited to hear if I got accepted into grad school or not. <endOfText>
<human> I bet! Have you gotten any word back yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my more embarrassing moments was when I was jumping over my backpack and my foot got caught in the handle. It's the only time I've ever actually fallen on my face. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once my dog got really sick. It was scary but I decided to completely trust my vet and he's still healthy today. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad! You must have a very good veterinarian <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a call from my sister's boyfriend that she was in a car wreck and was being life-flighted to the hospital with no information on her condition. Just that I need to get there quick. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! Is she going to be alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my dog. The way we are faithful to eachother...there is no other bond like it. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful.  What is your dogs name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Started a new job, it's so different from what I always have done. <endOfText>
<human> Do you at least enjoy the new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work at a dairy plant in San Antonio. I work in a small group and they are very close to me. It's humbling to have a close knit group of guys who have your back on things. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome. A lot of people would kill to have a cooperative work environment. I bet it increases performance as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While in grad school I missed out on a Foo Fighters concert my friends went to; I was really jealous. <endOfText>
<human> I love the foo fighters too.  I would have be raging!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't believe that you have! It is not available yet! <endOfText>
<human> Oh lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting on more money coming in, I'm starting a new business so fingers crossed! <endOfText>
<human> I hope that business goes well! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I use to be very trusting until 8 years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Why 8 years? That's a very specific time ago. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to a Braves game tomorrow for the first time and I'm a little apprehensive. <endOfText>
<human> It should be fun! Do you like baseball? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really shook me up when my wife filled for divorce 2 years ago. She gave me no warning and hired a lawyer right away. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, you had no clue it was coming? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our home is paid off <endOfText>
<human> How long did it take you? That's amazing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I consider you to be a lucky guy. I hope one day I can pay mine off completely. <endOfText>
<human> Worth the effort to do it, now work part time, mortgage is the biggest expense <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been having to deal with me and my wife's new business and it's been kind of stressful. <endOfText>
<human> My husband owns a business and its also stressful. What kind of business did yall start? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love living in my own house, it's a place where I can sit back and enjoy myself. I feel like i'm king of the castle. <endOfText>
<human> At least you are comfortable and enjoying that! Some people would hate being alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello. <endOfText>
<human> Hi! Tell me something about yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On my first date with my wife we got so drunk that I ended up wetting the bed! <endOfText>
<human> oh wow! did she notice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been trying to cheer my mom up a lot lately. She's kind of been struggling. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. I know that can be stressful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my turn and i was called up to sing, While singing, i noticed my trouser zip was full open because it had spoiled. It was really embarrassing and i felt really ashamed of myself <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry. I can imagine how you felt! Hopefully you hit a home run! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being a mom is such a struggle sometimes. On the one hand I really enjoy the break I get when my son stays with his grandparents. On the other I always feel a bit off kilter when he's not home with me. <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand what you mean. Peace and quiet is nice but I bet you miss your son when he is gone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling extremely nervous. I was about to go on stage in front of 4000 people. Almost couldn't believe that it was happening! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is a lot of people! What were you doing on stage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle died in the hospital,  he had malaria , till now,  I've not been myself <endOfText>
<human> So sorry to hear that, Hard to be alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm telling you,  it's so hard.  He helped to train me to school <endOfText>
<human> What did he train you in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a long cruise coming up <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  tell me about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor jokingly makes fun of me for a comment I made that came out very wrong. I turn red every time he mentions it now. <endOfText>
<human> Are you friends with your neighbor <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost made the biggest mistake of my life and cost me the greatest thing that ever happened to me. But I sobered up and didn't do it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that doesn't sound good. What almost happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new slushie flavor tonight. It sounded very good but it wasn't. Such a letdown. <endOfText>
<human> Oh,dont take it so hard,its always like that,so sorry about that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes things just don't work out. <endOfText>
<human> It will work out if you believe <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt i wouldnt succeed, <endOfText>
<human> What were you trying to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been hurt so bad by someone that you thought to yourself that you would NEVER put yourself in a position to get hurt again? <endOfText>
<human> Oh absolutely. That's the worst feeling. Who hurt you and how are you doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I have been married for 5 years but sometimes I still get annoyed with other women. We went to the bar recently and he was off with his friends when I noticed a girl trying desperately to get his attention. <endOfText>
<human> Ah. I can imagine I've been in a similar situation. But just remember he loves you and if he's never given you any doubt then trust him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to empty the trash outside and the can was covered with maggots. <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  that must be do disgusting  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow,  that must be do disgusting <endOfText>
<human> It was so gross. I felt like I was going to throw up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I refused to take my neighbors properties because what I had was enough for me <endOfText>
<human> Did you fix it so that they won't lose their property in the future? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not really,  he wanted me as a girlfriend <endOfText>
<human> I'm confused. What do you being his girlfriend have to do with you not taking his property? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have faith in a brighter future <endOfText>
<human> I hope you are right. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Took the wife to the club, big mistake. <endOfText>
<human> why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a meeting when someone accused me of stealing his money,  it was so tough on me <endOfText>
<human> That's the thing with accusations, anybody can say anything. But if they don't have any proof then it's meaningless. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seriously,  it was not funny,  but the truth came out finally <endOfText>
<human> It's hard to be accused of something you didn't do. I'm glad the truth prevailed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to teach an in-service class at work next week. I am feeling a bit uneasy about doing it. <endOfText>
<human> OK,  calm down,  take a deep breath and relax  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> OK,  calm down,  take a deep breath and relax <endOfText>
<human> I'm hesitant because I get nervous in front of groups. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a presentation at an international conference recently. I was terrified! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds pretty nerve-wracking. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have so much faith in my wife . <endOfText>
<human> That is positive, you must really love her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt ashamed when I haven't made an effort on my appearance then head outside into the public <endOfText>
<human> appearance is important, what's more important is how you look on the inside! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt a little bad the other day because I got upset with my son. He always panics when I have to buzz his hair and I was so frustrated. <endOfText>
<human> Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just moved into a new house and when I came home from work there was a giant spider crawling around. <endOfText>
<human> Yuck! I am so afraid of spiders. Were you able to squash it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my wife deal with all the finances.  I rely on her to do the right thing with it.  I am cool with that. <endOfText>
<human> that is so much trust! i hope she doesn't let you down! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i feel very hopeful for the future <endOfText>
<human> Why?  The sun is going to engulf the earth in a few billions years.  And even before that, the Y chromosome in humans is going to die out and our civilization will end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scrolling through Twitch the other day and saw someone playing Super Mario 64. I had to start watching right away because that was probably the first video game I ever played! <endOfText>
<human> did it feel nostalgic?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> did it feel nostalgic? <endOfText>
<human> Very much! My dad and I used to play it all the time when I was little. We would compete to see who could get the most stars. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i care about my wife and i always want the best for her <endOfText>
<human> That's very nice of you. I feel the same way about my husband. Isn't it nice to care about someone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my boyfriend so much when he lives in Holland and I live in the UK <endOfText>
<human> how much you trust him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> in that situation i felt proud by my father <endOfText>
<human> What was it that made you so proud of him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my father was a honest man, the shop owner also knows him <endOfText>
<human> being honest is always a good thing, I am glad you are so proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you lost a parent? <endOfText>
<human> i have. have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat's an outdoor cat that i let out to have fun, and i just found out he was run over by a car yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How old was he? I'm so sorry losing a pet is so hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any animals? I have one but have been thinking about getting another. <endOfText>
<human> yep i have a cat. he's really sweet, and totally worth it. but it all depends on what kind of animal you get <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i've never kissed a girl before and my girlfriend and i are going to kiss for the first time tomorrow night, and i know she's going to make me feel safe and special <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, That is a huge step! Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was in the train the other day and i fell and everyone started laughing at me <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that must have been so embarrassing. Were you injured at all?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no that must have been so embarrassing. Were you injured at all? <endOfText>
<human> i just got my knee bruised, and it really was embarrassing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to see Stephen King on his book tour for his new novel. He was handing out 100 signed books, but I didn't get one. <endOfText>
<human> that must've been very disapointing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im just sitting here with my cat in my lap and thinking about all the money in my bank account. life is good <endOfText>
<human> That's fantastic! Have you been working extra hard to earn it all, or did it come to you some other way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! I'm really happy for you- that must be such a great feeling of peace. <endOfText>
<human> yeah and now my cat gets the nice treats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mad when I came out of the salon with different hair color than I asked for <endOfText>
<human> What color did it end up being? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What is wrong? <endOfText>
<human> Sorry I hit the wrong button. I'm a teacher and I'm at a new school and my goal was NOT to make a fool of myself so of course first hour....I tripped over my stool and fell. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've gotten this job opportunity but, I don't think it will be a good fit <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you think it will be a good fit? You might be underestimating yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a girl i like at school told me today she doesn't like me in front of everyone <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That must have been really embarrassing! How did you respond? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i always question my ability and when that happens i envy people. <endOfText>
<human> Does that at least inspire you to improve your abilities? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had my friend over and my family started saying stuff that made me so embarrassed <endOfText>
<human> Have you ever knew some that got to do everything you wanted to but couldn't? Well have and its not fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i use to want to go to the dog show but never got to . But my friend got to go every time it came around. <endOfText>
<human> how did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like I have let my family down. I got into trouble with the law. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's not good. What did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to the cops about something I was questioned about. Truthfully, I didn't want other people to get into trouble. But instead, I was charged with making false statements to the police. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best, even if other people might get in trouble. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's not good. What did you do? <endOfText>
<human> I lied to the cops about something I was questioned about. Truthfully, I didn't want other people to get into trouble. But instead, I was charged with making false statements to the police.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been sleeping well for a few days now because my husband was on a 30 hour road trip to get our new puppy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's a great suggestion. Last night I actually did sleep a bit better because I opened the window and was able to listen to outdoor noises like crickets and cicadas. <endOfText>
<human> I love listening to nature. I live in the country, and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months, but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep. <endOfText>
<human> That's a great suggestion. Last night I actually did sleep a bit better because I opened the window and was able to listen to outdoor noises like crickets and cicadas.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so prepared for my job interview today <endOfText>
<human> What kind of job is it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did one of those water coasters the other day. <endOfText>
<human> did you have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> god has done so much for me in my life. i owe everything to him <endOfText>
<human> You sound very grateful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You sound very grateful. <endOfText>
<human> and i know he's going to come back for me and take me away from this place <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, hopefully you will enjoy it while you are here! <endOfText>
<human> i know he'll take care of me in heaven even if he hasn't taken care of me here on earth <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's a great, positive attitude. <endOfText>
<human> thank you but i think can it apply to everyone even if you aren't religious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was working on a huge project with a lot of people and made a huge mistake. Another person from another company could have embarassed me, but instead he helped me out and covered for me. <endOfText>
<human> that's nice. i wish i had people like that to work with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've never had that happen before either. It was a hostile environment and he certainly didn't have to help me, but he did. I've tried to be more like that since then. <endOfText>
<human> i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha. I doubt that. He was halfway around the world. It was a long time ago and he never asked for anything. <endOfText>
<human> did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it did. <endOfText>
<human> glad to hear it. i hope it's only grown since then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very disappointed that I was let go of a job I had had for years <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also, Do you have prospects for a future position? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was going through my things and I found my old Gamecube. I remember all the fun times I had playing with friends. <endOfText>
<human> Did it make you nostalgic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son sent me into an absolute panic at the grocery store the other day. He was only supposed to return his cart and instead he ran out the door! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I see , what happens then? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily a kind woman in line behind me went and brought him back. He'd only gone into the entryway to look at a gumball machine. <endOfText>
<human> That's ok , Its a gods grace <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really expectant anyway <endOfText>
<human> What were you expecting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband went all out for our date night. I was quite pleased and his efforts had a big impact on me. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so good,am happy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My false tooth came out while I was on a date with a guy I'd liked for months! It was horrible. <endOfText>
<human> Did he notice? That would have been embarrassing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so mad at my sister because she always talks bad things about me behind my back... <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, family should never betray each othey <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once got a terrible score on a test that was important to my final grade in the course, I was so scared to tell my parents because it was a very important class <endOfText>
<human> don't be sad it'll be okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> turns out my best bro has a crush on MY crush. and guess what? she like him back, and they're going on a date tonight <endOfText>
<human> well you should be happy for them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was looking at my old pictures the other day and it brought so much memories! <endOfText>
<human> hope they were bad ones <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i trust my project and i believe it's gonna do amazing! <endOfText>
<human> That's great- you should always feel confident in yourself. What is your project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend wanted to impress a girl so I let him borrow my sports car. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, like seriously.  Why the show off?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, like seriously.  Why the show off? <endOfText>
<human> She was out of his league and he wanted something to impress her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma fell sick,  and I have been the one taking care of her <endOfText>
<human> I hope she gets better. It must be very hard seeing loved ones in sickness. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah,  she's getting better,  she is so lovely .I love her so much <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. I hope that her sickness hasn't been too taxing on you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A worker was supposed to come to the house to fix my air conditioning. I changed my plans for him and just sat there. Then he never showed up and didn't even bother to call. <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying, did you call him after he didn't turn up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We didn't bother. At that point, we didn't want to use him anymore. <endOfText>
<human> That's understandable. What a frustrating experience for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was arguing for a long time with someone, and then everyone found out i was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I'm sorry. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> The thing was that it was my brother, so he will never let me forget it now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I really needed some help to get ready for my Moms birthday. I was so thankful that my nieces came to the rescue. <endOfText>
<human> Thats so good of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent hours shopping and getting everything I needed. I was finally done and went to the car and dropped my cookies all over the floor. I was so mad at myself! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds frustrating. Did you drop anything else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put off changing my kids diaper for 5 minutes. Poop ended up leaking out in front of many other people. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. With five kids, that has happened to me multiple times. I can commiserate! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi there, I have just left my current job in education due to a variety of unpleasant circumstances, with no other job to go into! It's both frightening and liberating! <endOfText>
<human> If you were unhappy, sometimes you just have to make that leap. Now you can explore your options! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just keep looking. My sister started out with a temp job that has since turned into a well paying permanent job that is even paying for her education. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that's brilliant and exciting, good for her! Hopefully something like that can happen for me too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my kids to a play area I used to go to as a kid. As I was there, I remembered all the good times that I had there. It was very sweet to remember. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that's lovely! I have such fond memories of running around in parks as a child. I don't think young people today really understand the value of just running around and playing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After having a big fight with my boyfriend, I came very close to cheating on him recently with a colleague of mine. But didn't. I couldn't bring myself to. <endOfText>
<human> i am glad you didn't no one deserves to be cheated on, it's the most distusting and stupid thing anyone can do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mum promised me a car last month if I pass my exam <endOfText>
<human> and did you pass your exam? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes I did,  but yet to see the car,  still expecting <endOfText>
<human> i hope she gets you something you like! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i recently talked to new people and they were really mean <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow,  what happened? <endOfText>
<human> i was just talking about how i miss old days and they said that i was too positive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i walked right up to the girl i like today and told her how i felt. i didn't even care what she was going to say, i just love to tell people what i feel <endOfText>
<human> that's nice, what did she say tho <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> don't force people to do anything, you need to show respect <endOfText>
<human> they need to give me respect because im so wonderful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started a new job recently at a pretty great restaurant owned by some pretty great people. I then was offered a higher pay by my previous employer to try and persuade me to come back. I had to turn it down, though. My new place is so good, that it would take a lot to make me leave. <endOfText>
<human> Being able to enjoy your workplace is worth it. You're lucky to be in that position <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you think you'll keep the job after school? <endOfText>
<human> Probably not, since getting a specific job is the whole reason I'm going to school. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried cooking a new recipe. But it really didn't look good while it was cooking. <endOfText>
<human> Wait untill its done <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She always make me proud <endOfText>
<human> Who always made you proud? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I changed jobs recently. I was a little unsure whether or not I was making the right choice, as the pay was about the same. I ended up changing, though. <endOfText>
<human> Change is always difficult. How do you feel about it now that you have made the transition? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Your message got cut off - but I hope it has been a good switch for you! <endOfText>
<human> Sorry about that. It is a good one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate the society we live in. <endOfText>
<human> me too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I entered a raffle to win these amazing homemade things. I really wanted this big beautiful quilt. It was so pretty. <endOfText>
<human> and what were the results? did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i feel stressed out because of work <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry. Try to relax if you can.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I'm sorry. Try to relax if you can. <endOfText>
<human> i am i een started doing yoga to relax. but nothing helps! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the future can be so scary, the unknown terrifies me. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it scares me to think about that sometimes, too. What in particular do you fear could happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend invited me to visit him in the new country he moved to, but I've heard such bad things about it that I'm afraid to go, and I keep putting it off. <endOfText>
<human> I would be careful. There is a lot of unrest in the world right now.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would be careful. There is a lot of unrest in the world right now. <endOfText>
<human> That's what I'm thinking. But how do I say that to him without coming off ignorant and offensive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought some beautiful jewelry online. It looked so nice in the picture. When I got it, I was very unhappy <endOfText>
<human> That's annoying when that happens. Did you ask for your money back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family said they were going to be coming in for a visit. I really wanted to see them and thought there was a good chance they would come! <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting!  Did they come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! It was so wonderful to see them because we have a small family, and I just love visiting. <endOfText>
<human> I enjoy visiting with my family too.  Unfortunately, I don't get to see them that often.  But when we do, I have a lot of fun.  Did you do anything special? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I baked my favorite food last night -- brownies! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds good. I wish I could have some! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost threw up when I went to discard the trash,  I saw maggots inside <endOfText>
<human> Maggots are so disgusting! Had the trash been sitting for awhile? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah , but never knew it could be that much . The sight alone was horrible <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, they can multiply pretty quickly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my oldest kids coming home outfit. It was so tiny! <endOfText>
<human> Lol,  exactly,  because they are children  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lol,  exactly,  because they are children <endOfText>
<human> They're just so little when they're first born. It's easy to forget. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was very happy to be incharge <endOfText>
<human> That's always a nice thing.  In charge of what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get a promotion I was up for because the person training me disliked me intensely. <endOfText>
<human> oooh no  thats was so bad  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks.  It was pretty awful when I found out she did it on purpose.  I thought I was just bad at the job. <endOfText>
<human> don't worry there's always another chance <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oooh no  thats was so bad <endOfText>
<human> Thanks.  It was pretty awful when I found out she did it on purpose.  I thought I was just bad at the job.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating some cake and then I saw some mold in it. It was at a restaurant we loved. It was not fun! <endOfText>
<human> That's so disgusting! I hope you didn't have to pay your bill! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, she did something. The manager was pretty upset too. <endOfText>
<human> I bet. That's so gross. I would have been sick! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a boy that I really liked. I was hoping he would ask me out on a date! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's cute!  How did that work out for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh my GOD! I CAN'T BELIEVE IT! I HATE MY BROTHER!!! <endOfText>
<human> WHAT HAPPEND ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car broke down recently and I got out to figure out what the problem was.  Someone finally pulled over to look, said he needed to get a few things and left me there waiting <endOfText>
<human> oh god, what did you end up doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i did something horrible <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They made my day worthwhile <endOfText>
<human> how did they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i keep deceiving my family <endOfText>
<human> Why do you keep decieving yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest walked to a neighbors house. It was his first time doing it alone. <endOfText>
<human> Kids grow up so quickly! Did you feel nervous about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate way too much junk food yesterday! I am usually good about being careful, but I just let myself overindulge. <endOfText>
<human> That happens to me sometimes, too.  I feel awful after! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend signed us up for belly dancing classes.  I really want to go, but I'm a little bit scared <endOfText>
<human> Oh, it sounds like fun! I'm sure you'd have a great time.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, it sounds like fun! I'm sure you'd have a great time. <endOfText>
<human> I'm hoping I'll get over my fear and go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I met a person at the grocery store and they asked me on a date! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Are you going to go on the date with them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thieves wanted to break into my compound , when they were caught,  I was eager to see their faces <endOfText>
<human> It was difficult for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my life is getting so much better ever since i met my wife <endOfText>
<human> Aww- that's great to hear! It sounds like she is your perfect match. How did you meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a test to get into Mensa. I didn't know how I did and really wanted to get in. I was worried about it!" <endOfText>
<human> Oh man- you must be really intelligent to test for Mensa! I bet it was difficult! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some parts were, but some parts were easy. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you hear positive news from them soon! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lied to my girlfriend yesterday.  I feel awful about it <endOfText>
<human> WHY ? what did you lie about?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> WHY ? what did you lie about? <endOfText>
<human> Something stupid.  I didn't want her to get mad but now I regret lying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard some noises outside the house. I thought someone was trying to break in. <endOfText>
<human> what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It turned out to be nothing, but it was really stressful. <endOfText>
<human> i can imagine, it happend to me before and it was actually someone trying to break in, i called hte police and they ran off <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving to a new destination and I kind of knew the directions. My mom did not turn the navigation on and she let me drive there. <endOfText>
<human> I hoe you made it there. Getting lost sucks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got married very young at 18. This year we celebrated our 12 year anniversary. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That is very interesting. These days, many people get married later in life. Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love my cat so much. im tending to him as he's dying, and it's such a sweet moment for us <endOfText>
<human> oh no :< that's so sad, i also have a cat but she is in her early days  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no :< that's so sad, i also have a cat but she is in her early days <endOfText>
<human> its just nice to be able to be there for someone who needs you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating some food at a restaurant when I found a hair in it. I didn't NOT want to eat any more! <endOfText>
<human> I know how you feel that would gross me out too.  Makes me feel like whoever prepared my food was not very clean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, it just feels yuck. It pretty much makes you lose your appetite. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I wouldn't be in the mood to eat after that either, it's disgusting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to go to Spacecamp. I filled out a form to try to get a scholarship because I knew that was the only way I could go. <endOfText>
<human> which way is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I could only go if I got a scholarship because I couldn't afford it otherwise. <endOfText>
<human> maybe it happend for a reason? maybe you will find a better apportunity to get there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did some maintenance on my car and learned how to change out the thermostat. It was very easy using Youtube as guidance! <endOfText>
<human> it's insane how Youtube and the internet overall are so helpful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seriously! I wouldn't have never learned this stuff and would of had to spend hundred of dollars at a repair shop! <endOfText>
<human> that's so insane right? glad you did it yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ten-year-old cat died a few weeks ago. I still can't believe he's gone. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. Tell me a fond memory you have of him/her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work the other day and this young lady started hitting on me for no reason. I told her I was married but she kept on trying to flirt with me. <endOfText>
<human> It's terrible when people can't take no for an answer. Did you report her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran like never before when I saw a black cat in my room <endOfText>
<human> I think you do not like cats very much ... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The sight of it scares me,  I love the white one though,  but not black <endOfText>
<human> Well, then, you should think about God when you see them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last December, my husband lost his job. He's our main source of income. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm really sorry to hear that. Has he been looking for another job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried out for the broadcasting club to do the announcements at school. I really wanted to get in! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting? Did you get in to the club?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds exciting? Did you get in to the club? <endOfText>
<human> I did! I remember being so happy at that moment, even though it was 25 years ago! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you ever had a big test coming up that you worried about? Well I had one recently.and I did not worry at all. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good because you prepared for it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They always neglt me <endOfText>
<human> who does and that is mean of them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today is the anniversary of my fathers death. He has been gone for 18 years now. <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  18 years. Accept my condolence please  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow,  18 years. Accept my condolence please <endOfText>
<human> Thanks. It's hard all of the time but the anniversary always just brings it all back. Makes me feel really down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really felt so bad when I remembered how I stole my mum's money and my brother was punished for it <endOfText>
<human> Maybe it's time to clear your conscience so you won't have to feel so bad anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm trying so hard seriously <endOfText>
<human> You can't change the past. All you can do is learn from it. If you are sincere then your family will forgive you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wife and kids. I sacrifice so much time for them all and it feels great! <endOfText>
<human> Same, don't know what i would do without them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today at the grocery store my car was hit! He was on his phone! <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry!  That's awful!  Did you get his insurance information? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss keeps putting off my employee review and it's really stressing me out. <endOfText>
<human> Is there anyone else you can talk to? Maybe even Human Resources? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's a good idea.  I'm just worried because she only has two employees and it'll be obvious it was me. <endOfText>
<human> I see where you're coming from. Sometimes though you got to make a stand and show you're serious about the position. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During my birthday,  my dad bought me a gold watch , I was so happy <endOfText>
<human> What a lovely gift. I'm sure that you will always treasure it because it came from him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was backing out of the driveway and I ran over a bike that I had told the kids to put away. I was so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  that was not cool at all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everyone applauded me <endOfText>
<human> That must feel amazing! What did you do to deserve the recognition?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cleard my papers <endOfText>
<human> Was this at the office? Or perhaps at school? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must feel amazing! What did you do to deserve the recognition? <endOfText>
<human> I cleard my papers  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was thinking about my childhood the other day. I came from a pretty good family and life was so nice and simple when you're young. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good,it feels good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew signed up to join the Marines. I was overwhelmed with happy emotions that he would choose to serve our country. <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  that's great news.  I love that  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think it is such an honorable thing to do. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly , it is quite cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow,  that's great news.  I love that <endOfText>
<human> I think it is such an honorable thing to do.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt sick to my stomach waiting in line for a new roller coaster. <endOfText>
<human> I would have felt the same way. I am really afraid to get on any roller coaster. How was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hung out with one of my old friends yesterday. We had a good time talking about the things we used to get into, back in the day. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of things did you all like to do? Sounds like it was fun to catch up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have kids? Some of the things they do are nasty! My girlfriends kid is such a messy eater! <endOfText>
<human> I do. I have one and another one on the way. They can be gross little critters! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out a friend at work is pregnant! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, exciting! Is this going to be your friend's first child? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Second actually. have to be a bit careful though.  We work around some dangerous chemicals. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds scary. How often do children of the employees at your work end up harmed because of the chemicals? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came back home and noticed my younger brother kept everywhere clean, It pleased me <endOfText>
<human> That's a pleasant surprise! Is this out of the ordinary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found some old pictures of my Dad fishing. I miss fishing with him. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I've never done fishing,  so how is it like  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, I've never done fishing,  so how is it like <endOfText>
<human> I used to love going with Dad, but haven't really gone much since he passed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's well.  Please accept my condolence <endOfText>
<human> Thank you. It was quite some time ago, I was just being nostalgic. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some kittens in an abandoned house recently. They were so malnourished, I took them home, fed them, and now they're part of the family. <endOfText>
<human> You did so well,have you given them names? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was diagnosed with a inguinal hernia yesterday. The amount of stress and anxiety is through the roof for me right now. <endOfText>
<human> Holy crap! Can it be remedied? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been married nearly eight years and someone hit on me last week. Luckily we have always been happy together or else that could have taken a weird turn. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it felt good though? That's good that you're happily married! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pity on my boyfriend last week,  but I wanted to leave him <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? Did you get it worked out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No,  he convinced me,  so I stayed.  But don't like his attitude <endOfText>
<human> Have you considered couples therapy to try and work things out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a brand new jeep, and it's damaged already. I'm upset. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no,  that is not cool.  What happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no,  that is not cool.  What happened? <endOfText>
<human> Someone crashed into it in a parking lot. Didn't even leave a note. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That person is heartless though <endOfText>
<human> I agree. People can be such jerks sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got permission to begin a start up company by my own.. i am so excited <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that sounds exciting! I hope everything works out for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes.. it is unexpected indeed.. i thought i would be struggling to get support.. <endOfText>
<human> Seems like it is your fate then. I am also starting a new venture and it is taking a lot of time and hard work but I think it is finally paying off soon.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lately at night when I go to sleep I've been having sleep paralysis. It feels terrifying! Like someone is in the room with me. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible. Have you any idea what might have caused it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved house recently, from an absolute dump. The new place isn't huge, but it's perfect for me. <endOfText>
<human> That's one of the most responsible things you can do. I'm sure your family is proud of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, my employer of 13 years shut their doors and we all were laid off. I would probably have stayed at that place my entire career if it hadn't closed. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been devastating. Did it take you a long time to find a new position? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat is such a comfort.  He likes to sleep under the covers with me. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome!  I have 5 cats.  They are pretty snobbish and only 2 like to cuddle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww!  I've only the one right now, but he is the cuddliest kitty.  Demands to be under the blankets with me most nights. <endOfText>
<human> That is sweet.  My cats have human names, lol.  What about yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Same.  I got his out of an old detective novel. <endOfText>
<human> I recently had to surrender 1, we had six before.  But he was being bullied by the others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We do the best for them, even if it's not what we want. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you have a cuddly fur-baby! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was given a beffitting birthday by my sibblings <endOfText>
<human> How old did you turn? I hope you guys had some cake too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my mom's dog yesterday and it's been about 24 hours since she went missing! I'm trying to find her but had to take a break. <endOfText>
<human> So sorry about that,she will be found <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am broke and cannot afford to pay my bills. I am afraid that I have hurt my family because of my mental issues. I am embarrassed to tell anyone. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. What can I do to help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't think there is anything you can do to help. This is something, I most likely will need to resolve on my own. Unfortunately. <endOfText>
<human> Perhaps you could see a counselor or therapist, that might help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My insurance will not cover this type of expenses. I am medicated, but I do not feel that it helps. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's too bad. There are many free programs that you might be able to access. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe so, I should look into that. I feel like just speaking to someone about this would help. <endOfText>
<human> That's a great idea. I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel such love and joy towards my sister's new baby. It's overwhelming. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that is wonderful. Is it a girl or boy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is a wonderful feeling, to be a parent. Fingers crossed, you'll be next. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks! Right now I'm happy to be spoiling my new niece. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a 9 month old great niece, she's the sweetest thing ever. <endOfText>
<human> Aww! Babies are so much fun! I have a new granddaughter, so I can relate! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to see my baby born on Friday. My first son was born and is in healthy shape. <endOfText>
<human> wow that must have been so hard to do! i am so proud of you worker_2 how do you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are so close and always believe in each other <endOfText>
<human> Are you talking about me or someone else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She had a genuine personality that made you feel comfortable almost immediately. <endOfText>
<human> Who was she because she sounds special? Someone close to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had no clue what I was going to make for supper. When I got home my husband had fixed us a wonderful meal. <endOfText>
<human> wow! that's so nice of him, what did he make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> everyone around me was pointing and laughing. I think I saw a couple of smartphones whip out and people taking pictures <endOfText>
<human> What really happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I slipped and fell at walmart. while wearing a skirt with no panties. <endOfText>
<human> Oh,so sorry about that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldnt help myself esteem <endOfText>
<human> oh no. what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Seattle once and it is such a pretty city.  But the rain, oh the rain.  I fell right in front of this cute guy. <endOfText>
<human> Did he try to help you up? I've always wanted to see Seattle! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife's cooking is amazing these days. She has really come a long way from when we first met. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful!  It's a lot of work learning to cook.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's wonderful!  It's a lot of work learning to cook. <endOfText>
<human> I can only grill food on a barbecue pit. She has learned how to create new dishes I have never even thought possible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got so mad,  when my little sister spilled oil on my white trouser <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's rough. I bet that ruined them, didn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> exactly,  and I was already late to work <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like the start to a bad day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love the feeling of getting home from work and having a few hours before bed to hang out and watch TV and stuff. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly,  that feels nice  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Exactly,  that feels nice <endOfText>
<human> I think it's needed to keep our heads straight, so we don't get bogged down in the nonsense of daily life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband and I have been married 28 years. I've never even looked at another man. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing. There are not a lot of people that can say that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is the most trustworthy person I know and he makes me a better person. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure he feels the same way about you! How long have you two been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son told me how much he loves and appreciates me. I haven't seen him around here in over 5 years. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Sometimes life gets in the way and we forget what is the most important to us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These days I feel so isolated and alone. My daughter moved out so it's only me these days. <endOfText>
<human> That is a hard stage of life that I am not looking forward to! Do you get to talk to her often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother is such a wonderful person and when I was 5 years old, she crocheted me the most beautiful pink and blue baby doll blanket. <endOfText>
<human> Do you still have the blanket? That's an amazing gift from a wonderful part of your family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During a storm, a water main broke and flooded my entire house just a few weeks after my son was born. It destroyed a lot of our belongings and the house was ruined. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you're recovering well enough! That is absolutely devastating news to read. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great news! Did you have insurance? <endOfText>
<human> We did so the financial aspect was not much of a hardship, but it was during Thanksgiving holiday so it made Christmas shopping difficult. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left work early today and feel a little bad about it. I was really sick and now I know I'll have to play catch up later today when I go back. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, you shouldn't feel bad! Everyone gets sick every once in a while and I would hope that your boss and coworkers were very understanding of your needs. It is important to take care of yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally sent my boss an inappropriate text last night! I'm so mortified! <endOfText>
<human> Oh crap! That's not good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend helped me with my chores when she came to my house last weekend <endOfText>
<human> That's nice of her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah,  she is so lovely <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like it. You deserve someone like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My uncle tragically passed away in a car accident, leaving behind his wife and son. I desperately wanted to help them in their time of need, even if it was simply cleaning the house. They are the sweetest family. <endOfText>
<human> That is really good and will be helpful.  I lost my wife to cancer years ago and people helping was great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is wonderful that you have been able to turn a tragedy into an opportunity to empathize with others facing the same difficulties. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, the support and love from others that we received was incredible so I always try to help as much as I can.  Even the smallest gestures were meaningful.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, the support and love from others that we received was incredible so I always try to help as much as I can.  Even the smallest gestures were meaningful. <endOfText>
<human> Not many people reciprocate the efforts of others and I commend you for considering your own suffering and using it to better others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Through our family's tragedy, we learned that there is a larger connection between people.  Our church family was huge is supporting us. <endOfText>
<human> I have always had a great church family. My aunt's church was pivotal in showing me how to be the best I could be and developing my character. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really scared about the possibility of losing my cat to a bad illness, but I was lucky that the vet worked hard to find out what was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I'm glad the vet was able to do that. It must have been scary.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, I'm glad the vet was able to do that. It must have been scary. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I was petrified at first because it looked dire! The vet knew how badly I wanted help for my cat, so thank heavens she cared to get an answer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had plans with my boyfriend, but one of my good friends is going through a really hard time, so I canceled with him to go hang out with her instead. I think she was really appreciative of it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that was wonderful of you! Everyone needs a friend like you who understands that emotional support is very important! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, I appreciate that. I know she would do the same for me, so I'm happy to be there for her. <endOfText>
<human> You are both lucky then! She will remember your kindness for a long time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi! I just found out that my daughter is moving to another state. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry, I know that must make you sad and stressed. I have a daughter who lives pretty far away too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for all the help I received after my mom passed away. I was able to overcome my grief thanks to all my friends and family :) <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear about your mom, but it's great that you had such support to help you through. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, they have been so supportive these last few years. I really love them and am so grateful to have them! <endOfText>
<human> Having a strong support system is so important in life.  Don't know what I would do without my friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My oldest friends live in San Francisco and I haven't had a chance to visit in four years. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, you must miss them. Why haven't you been able to visit them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sorry to hear that, you must miss them. Why haven't you been able to visit them? <endOfText>
<human> Money, I just finished grad school last year and found a full time job.  Now I have a bit of vacation and I'm very excited to start planning the trip! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My house is perfect for my family. Just big enough for everyone. I love it. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! I close on my first house Monday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My shorts fell down one time in gym class. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that is super embarrassing. Did anyone take a picture? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have my tonsils removed last year. The surgeon was reassuring when I was worried, which was very helpful. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, I imagine that all surgeries can be stressful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think the movie would have been fun, but I felt much better honoring my prior commitment and being faithful to that friend. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you made the right call <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I filled out all of my "new patient" paper work before my appointment with my new doctor. <endOfText>
<human> Did it take a long time to complete? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work in a building that has parts of it under construction and our senior staff is offering tours. I'm a little worried about tripping and falling on something if I take a tour through the live construction zone. <endOfText>
<human> I can certainly relate to you, it could be a safety hazard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree! I think if I do it, i need to buy some closed-toe shoes and make sure I'm wearing the correct clothing. <endOfText>
<human> That's a smart move, that would reduce the risk of injury. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is hard to make a decision to take a new job when you have been with one employer for a long time. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. Do you find yourself in that situation right now?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree. Do you find yourself in that situation right now? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I feel like I need new experiences but I feel a sense of loyalty to my current employer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's very kind of you to be so considerate. Hopefully the right choice will make itself obvious to you in the near future. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I want to keep growing in my career. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well good luck to you! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you, I appreciate it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking to get this new job in my area. <endOfText>
<human> Great, I hope you get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How can a mother do that to a child? <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, do what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm installing a new dishwasher in my kitchen today! <endOfText>
<human> That is great! Are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great! Are you doing it yourself or are you hiring someone to help you out? <endOfText>
<human> I'm doing it myself! I've never done it, but I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, so I feel like I'm ready to tackle this job! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling a little lonely lately <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that! Maybe you can find a local club so you can meet people with similar interests! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds like a great idea! I would love to just dance and shake off all these bad vibes! :) <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun! And a great cure for loneliness!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello!  I was really worried about my son the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what was wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we were trying to buy our first home, our financing fell through. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That had to be frustrating. I hope it wasn't too close to closing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very sad, my mother recently passed away from a heart attack <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I'm so sorry. I totally understand how you feel. Mine passed away a few years ago, It's very difficult <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I am very lucky to a have a great boyfriend, has has been very supportive and is helping me pull myself together. <endOfText>
<human> It definitely helps to have a lot of support around you. Take care of yourself through this very difficult time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I walked around with makeup smeared all over my face. I wish someone had told me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! I did that after swimming one day. I was so busy getting the kids dressed that I forgot to clean my face. Black mascara all down my cheeks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son was potty training when he was 2 and he ran out at a party without his pants on! My jaw dropped and I couldn't hide my red face! <endOfText>
<human> Were there other parents there? I think that anyone who has kids would understand. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey there, I had an embarrassing situation today.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that! It can be tough when we feel that we have lost face in front of others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It wasn't easy recently when I told a friend I needed to stay home from going out for food and some entertainment because it wasn't something I could afford. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. I hope your financial situation improves in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was rather nervous the other night when I was waiting to sing at a concert. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few months ago I found some old family pictures. It made me miss old times <endOfText>
<human> Were they from when you were a kid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were. It made me miss all my cousins and Aunts and Uncles who've passed. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. I sure miss my departed loved ones. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so mad at my neighbor! He's working on his home and dropped nails in the street. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Does he do that a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year my grandmother passed away. It's still hard to cope with <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a family member is so hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is. I still can't look at old pictures of her. <endOfText>
<human> I miss my grandmother every day. I hope things get easier for you over time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband convinced me that it was a good move. <endOfText>
<human> What was a good move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out for dinner the other night and it was at a really fancy restaurant.  I knocked my drink over by accident. <endOfText>
<human> Hey a similar thing happened to me! I hope no one saw! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to get to a loaf of bread in the fridge, and I knocked over a full tub of my mother in law's chicken corn chowder! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been messy.  Were you able to get it all cleaned up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a teenager I went tandem skydiving. This involved a total stranger being strapped to my back and jumping out of a plane. Thinking back on it now, I had to put a lot of trust that that dude wasn't a psycho murderer. <endOfText>
<human>  Wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that definitely sounds like a crazy situation! <endOfText>
<human> Haha yea it does now. Back then it seemed so reasonable. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I promised to visit a friend in prison every week. I enjoyed each time <endOfText>
<human> That's really interesting. What were they in prison for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were at the wrong place at the wrong time unfortunately. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, I hope they are ok now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved into a new place and I'm still waiting on a deposit from my old place. It's not looking good. <endOfText>
<human> Did you leave the old place damged <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend had her galbladder taken out. she was in the hospital for 3 days <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! I hope it hadn't ruptured already. Is she okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was pregnant, the smell of cooking egss made me feel so sick <endOfText>
<human> Really? Did you avoid eating them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so nervous to ride that roller coaster, but my sister was begging me to go. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I know that feeling!  Did you end up going on the ride? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a teacher, one of my students was in a house fire. <endOfText>
<human> Is your student ok?? I am so sorry about that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching an old VHS tape of my family and I out at the beach. It's crazy to think how time has flown by so fast. <endOfText>
<human> That must have brought back a lot of memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate when you try and help someone with something and then you mess it up? I was trying to ease the burden of housework for my husband this weekend and it didn't go well. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a teacher, start back at work in just 2 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have a nice summer break? Are you excited for school to start back up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week someone approached me and tried to get information about a close friends business. <endOfText>
<human> Some people are too nosy. What did you say to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had this dirtbike since I was a kid, and took all kinds of care of it. My neighbor backed over it on accident. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been upsetting.  Were you able to get it fixed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a teacher. and school starts back up in just 2 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> COunting down the days, eh? How was your summer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went my wife's job recently, and while I was waiting for her in the reception area, one of her coworkers was hitting on me. I politely declined their advances, and asked to be left alone while I waited for my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Did she know who you were? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is a sophomore in college and spent the summer with her boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Do you like her boyfriend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have met him once. He seems like a nice guy. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, hopefully they treat each other well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the best weekend! My husband brought a puppy home and seeing him with our son for the first time was so cute! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds adorable! What type of puppy is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was about seven years old, my cat Hector got out of the house and got lost in the neighborhood. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were you able to find him ever?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! Were you able to find him ever? <endOfText>
<human> Unfortunately we weren't. We put out signs but never were able to track him down. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a teacher, and am back at school in just 2 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you're coming back into a great school. I'm sure the kids will be excited to see you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just got over being sick. It was a weird summer flu. It could've been worse <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad that she's starting to feel better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine just won  a lot of money off of a lottery ticket. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that's amazing! How much was it? I hope they share. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Summer is drawing down and I'm ready to just kick back for a little bit. This is usually the busy time of year for me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm a teacher, so it's the opposite for me.  My relaxing time is about to end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On Saturday, I was able to go to the park and enjoy nature. <endOfText>
<human> Was it really nice out? I love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband got a raise at work this week! I was so impressed with him. <endOfText>
<human> Thats's great! I bet he's been working really hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a movie the other night with my kids, they really enjoyed it and we had a lot of cute conversation about it. <endOfText>
<human> What was the movie? I'm always looking for something new to watch with my kids! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had to go interview for a job I knew I was under qualified for, so I was fairly nervous going in. <endOfText>
<human> I'd have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was looking through some old photo albums. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that must of been a trip. How did it make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was younger, in a lapse of judgement, I stole chocolate bars from a shop I used to work in. I was caught. I felt terrible. It wasn't like me at all. I wish I could undo my actions. <endOfText>
<human> I think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would not beat yourself up over the mistake. We all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you, that means a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom sent me a package the other day that had a bunch of my old comics in it the other day. It was a real trip to go through them all, it brought back a lot of memories. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son's pediatrician told me to call Early Intervention because he's delayed in talking. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My toddler son has been so exhausting lately. Luckily, his grandparents were able to take him for an overnight the other night which was a nice break. <endOfText>
<human> I totally know how you feel. I have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out that a friend of mine from high school passed away recently. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard on the radio that Beyonce will be performing in my city soon. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. Are you a big fan of her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine had an pretty serious illness and had to be in the hospital for quite a while. I spent as much time as I could there with him to keep his spirits up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks, I hate seeing friends and family injured or sick. That's very nice of you though that you stayed there with him, youre a good friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have never been an athletic person, but my parents insisted that I participate in a sport, so I chose softball. I was so excited when I heard the crack of the bat as I hit the ball. It was such a satisfying moment. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I know the feeling! I had the same affinity for swimming. My mom said I should give it a try. At first I didn't want to but as I got better I started to love it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter starts playing softball this year.  I tried playing when I was younger, but the other girls were mean <endOfText>
<human> I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been pet sitting for my mom the last couple weeks, and my wife decided to come spend the weekend with me last week. It was really nice just to have her with me. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds relaxing!  Quality alone time is important in a relationship <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we were kids, my older sister pretended to abandon me at the mall because I was being a brat. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking to a restaurant to meet with some friends, and on my way there I tripped over a tree branch in front of a bunch of people and looked like a total idiot. <endOfText>
<human> When you tripped over the branch, did you get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always think I want some "me" time, but this weekend my husband and our toddler son were both gone and I actually kind of felt bored and sad! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it really isn't for everyone, i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Exactly. We have an infant daughter, but she goes to bed so early that I had a lot of hours of doing nothing in particular. <endOfText>
<human> Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Going out to run errands for the first time after having a baby was scary. I was so afraid I would forget something I needed. I was so relieved when we returned home and everything went perfectly smooth. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared to skydive, but my instructor was great and I was finally able to jump. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have belief in myself, I have belief in God. I know that what I can't do, God can do. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A game I'm really looking forward to is coming out this October, and I'm super pumped to play it. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, it's been a while since i've anticipated any new games. what game is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Verizon sent me a damaged iphone and I returned it. Now they're claiming they never received it! I got charged over 500 dollars for it. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds horrible. I would be so mad at them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom made a cake for my brother's birthday so I can't touch it until he eats first. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed away 20 years ago.  I just found a quilt she made me when I was a baby <endOfText>
<human> Wow what a find, cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm incredibly upset.  I just found out my husband has been cheating on me last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh damn, that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate to bring this up because of how it makes me look. I just found out my parents have been paying my sister's mortgage. Great for her but I get nothing in my times of need. <endOfText>
<human> I get where you're coming from, my mom supports both of my sisters. It can make you feel less important. hopefully you are getting along though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself. <endOfText>
<human> I certainly hear about it a lot! haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was challenged to a 2 on 2 pool game with my partner being my friend Joe. <endOfText>
<human> Did you and Joe do well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine recently had their bathroom remodeled, and it made me feel like mine looks terrible by comparison. <endOfText>
<human> That's reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just can't stand it when people make uninformed remarks about a subject. My mom irritated me so bad by doing that the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it's annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Agreed! My husband and I did a ton of research on a new puppy we were getting and she still found the worst article she could to act like she knew more than us. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, yes, I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had to make a BIG move from Hawaii to Nashville when my husband lost a job. We didn't know anybody here but we just had to believe it would turn out okay... <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It seems funny to me how all my hometown friends are all moving away <endOfText>
<human> Tell me about it. Both of my best friends moved several states away from me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Ac went out a month ago. I knew it was gonna be during the summer. <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine challenged me and said I couldn't eat an entire bag of jelly beans. I'm super competitive and had to prove her wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my neighbor who is elderly has an above ground swimming pool. It's tilting because it wasn't put together properly. It was getting very unsafe <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's awful. That could be dangerous too! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few months before having my first kiddo, we decided to buy a car. It did very well during the initial inspection, but within a month, it needed several thousand dollars in repairs! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is 3 and we've been working on his ABCs lately. <endOfText>
<human> What an exciting time! How's he doing with it so far? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest sister is about to start her senior year of high school.  I'm so proud of everything she has accomplished. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awesome! I am an only child but I bet it's so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am an avid book collector and reader. I recently unpacked all my books and it took me so long! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh! You must have a lot of books!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh! You must have a lot of books! <endOfText>
<human> I was super shocked to find out that I have over 300 so far! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I renewed out wedding vows for our 25th anniversary. It was such a sweet and memory filled day. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Congratulations! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do. Was it just the two of you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you. No, my grown children were there. They made a slide show of hubby and I over the years. Brought tears to my eyes. <endOfText>
<human> Aw that is so sweet. That sounds like the most special day.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This is going to make me sound like a chicken, but I've got a neighbor whos twice my size and a little bit of a rage case. His fence is falling over into my yard. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst! Do you think he'd be mad if you asked him to fix the fence? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish you luck and hope everything ends up going well. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you so much, I hope for the best haha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The first time I met my husband I made an absolute fool of myself. I drank way too much. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a party last weekend, and I got everything ready a week in advance so it would go well. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, gotta be prepared. Hope the party went well.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice, gotta be prepared. Hope the party went well. <endOfText>
<human> It went very well, my guests all seemed to have a good time, and we didn't run out of booze or food the wole night! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out I didn't get into the college I wanted to. I'm really disappointed and feel like I should give up <endOfText>
<human> Don't give up! You will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I needed to get rid of some things, so I made a Craigslist post to come to my house and take them. <endOfText>
<human> How was the response to your ad?  Did you get rid of everything you wanted to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom sent my a bunch of stuff from my childhood the other day. It was really nice to see a lot of it. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of things did she give you?  Were they things that you asked for before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I grew up in Japan and for some reason my brother and I liked older music. Especially the Beatles. When I hear their songs, I think of him... <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that is so sweet. I am guessing you and your brother were close? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store last week and slipped on some water on the floor I didn't see. I broke my leg! I was mortified! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! That's awful! Are you still in pain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been flipping through some old photo albums and it chokes me up thinking about simpler times. <endOfText>
<human> I understand that, going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend had to have a mole biopsied and check for cancer, and they were quite worried about it. Luckily, we found out the other day that it is noncancerous and just needs to be remmoved. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, what great news! I'm sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking around with my brother on a Sunday, and I got into a pointless argument with him. I am disappointed that I left myself get caught up in it. <endOfText>
<human> I think we all do that with our siblings. I'm sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my daughter to see a circus show at Circus Circus in Reno, and that look on her face was priceless. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I've been there! So much fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My one year old just learned how to take off her diaper and she smeared poop all over my leg the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god, I bet you were grossed out but laughing at the same time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am about to become a grandma for the third time. My daughter has two boys already and I'm thinking pink... <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations, that is so exciting!!!  I know we should only hope for healthy but I'll keep my fingers crossed for pink :-) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother-law-donated a kidney to her cousin, who was sick. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that was very generous and courageous for her! How are they now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've entered an upcoming endurance competition like a tough mudder. I've been going at it for months and I believe I am hyperFOCUSED. <endOfText>
<human> you need to rest to the competition <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i felt trusting when my dad and my mon care for me <endOfText>
<human> Well as a fellow human being, I agree that when parents care for their children, it creates a lifelasting bond between the two parties. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait! We just bought a car today! Going to pick it up soon! <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! That is exciting! What kind of car did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A 2018 Ford Fusion! It's the first brand new car we've evered owned! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, so jealous! You have to give me a ride one day, ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was stuck on the side of the road when I saw a police officer ride by he slowed down and came back to help me <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that's a scary situation to be in. I'm glad the officer was able to help you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out the other day that I didn't get ther job I interviewed for. <endOfText>
<human> thats not good did you aplly for any other jobs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been laid up all day with an illness so it's good to be talking to someone. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful! I hope you feel better soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whenever I need to travel and cannot take my kids, I know that I can leave them with my parents and not have to worry at all about their safety and security. <endOfText>
<human> That is so wonderful! I have 3 children myself and I love having grandparents to rely on.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree. I have used daycare and such, but there are always problems there. I know my parents will always be alert and keep them safe, and not just for a paycheck. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you have someone to rely on for support. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is so wonderful! I have 3 children myself and I love having grandparents to rely on. <endOfText>
<human> It is wonderful. I'm not sure I trust anyone as much as my own parents with my kiddos. My parents treat my kids better than they treated me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad gave my son a very special model car and within the week, it was broken. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble! <endOfText>
<human> He didn't understand, so he wasn't in trouble, but I have to admit I was a little sad about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'd say so. That's so disheartening. I'm sure it was accidental. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it was and my dad acted like it was no big deal and just gave him a hug so it was a good lesson in forgiveness. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend moved for a new job recently and she just took her two dogs to a shelter. She didn't even try to find them homes. <endOfText>
<human> Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got a promotion. It's quite a big step up from my current role, so I'm very nervous that I won't do well in it. <endOfText>
<human> That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldn't have promoted you if you couldn't do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so, everyone tells me I'll do great, but I still have some reservations about it. It's way different than what I do now. I've not been sleeping well. <endOfText>
<human> Well usually when you think the worst it turns out to be okay. I think you should try and relax. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My partner and I both work 24 hour shifts on alternate days, too. <endOfText>
<human> What do you guys do for work? You sound like doctors <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish! We are both Paramedic/Firefighters. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for all that you do! I have a friend whos an EMT and I bet it's taxing work. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been struggling all day. I had some carryout over the weekend and it's hitting me in the worse way. Very ill. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. Are you feeling nauseated?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sorry to hear that. Are you feeling nauseated? <endOfText>
<human> I was feeling worse earlier, with a lot of food poisoning like symptoms. I'm just now getting over the nausea. Sorry to gross you out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You're not grossing me out at all. I'm a Paramedic/Firefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of Gatorade and water to rehydrate so you don't feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some Zofran for the Nausea. <endOfText>
<human> Wow I didn't think of zofran. Thanks for the advice! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while back I moved from Chicago to Dallas, I was pretty sad to leave. It was my hometown! <endOfText>
<human> Big change! both big cities though right? I've always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Big change! both big cities though right? I've always wanted to see that shiny bean thing in chicago. <endOfText>
<human> Yes both are big cities! However Chicago feels less crowded honestly, the metroplex there is more spread out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A tree fell on my house, shattering my vinyl fence as my kids and I were walking passed it through the garage. <endOfText>
<human> Woah I hope no one was hurt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was babysitting for someone I really didn't know. When they brought in the car seat, cockroaches crawled out of it. It was so gross!! <endOfText>
<human> Ew, that's really disturbing.  The sight of cockroaches always gives me the willies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Woof I am having a hard time as of late. I've been waiting on an acceptance into a video production program and it's driving me up the wall. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that must be nerve-wracking!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that must be nerve-wracking! <endOfText>
<human> It is. A lot of self doubt has crept into my head as of late and I'm trying to fight it off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter picked a new flavor of ice cream and my friend and I ate it before she even got a bite. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Do you think she will be mad when she finds out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked in a nursing home while I was in nursing school. I have since gone back to the home to visit my old patients to check in on them. <endOfText>
<human> that must be a heart warming reunion to see your old patience <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About two weeks ago on the way to work, i managed to leave my wallet and keys on the bus! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did they disappear for good, or did someone turn them in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would be so scary. I actually left my credit card at a restaurant yesterday. Thankfully they held onto it for me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you are so lucky it was handed back it! It gives you such a fright when it happens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been training my cats to use the toilet. At first they were and everyone was super impressed, but now they've forsaken the toilet AND litter box entirely. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! So have you tried any methods to get them back on track? Someone might have advice on Youtube. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently, my dog died. It was so heartbreaking. We had him since 2010. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that would make him quite young. I'm so sorry! Do you have plans for another one when you're ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was a loving dog. Probably! I would love to get a Labrador Retriever. <endOfText>
<human> Those are awesome dogs, I've known quite a few in my life. Well whenever you're ready I think it'll be a perfect match. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend and I are finally in a place where we can just be together without even speaking. Sometimes it's nice to just be in the same room <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's good! It's nice to have to someone you can do that with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband had a job interview a few days ago...now we are waiting... <endOfText>
<human> Ahh that's so anxiety-making. I hope he gets the jon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We used some of the money we'd set aside for our son's college fund to fix our hot water heater. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's a terrible problem!  That's the only time I don't envy homeowners!  I could not afford that at all.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that's a terrible problem!  That's the only time I don't envy homeowners!  I could not afford that at all. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, these are the times I miss renting so much!  We're trying to repay what we used monthly til it's replenished. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work from home now, but the last few years, I worked at a daycare.  It doesn't seem like much but my kids went for free and I loved everyone there! I should have quit so many times but I stayed <endOfText>
<human> I can see why it was hard to quit!  Do you like your job now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like it okay.  I still miss it though.  Even after Hurricane Harvey and my work building flooded, I drove an extra 40 minutes to get there.  But I had a baby recently and it jsut makes sense to be at home now. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds tough.  It seems like you guys at the daycare went through a lot together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will never forget when my daughter was born and they gave her to me for the first time! <endOfText>
<human> That is an amazing feeling. I have three daughters. It doesn't matter how many you have, the first time you hold them, its amazing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome. I would love to have a boy too, but I'm not sure if I want another one or not. <endOfText>
<human> I'm debating on another too. My youngest is only 17 months so I am definitely not in a rush. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A couple weeks ago I help a door open for an elderly couple. I really think it's important for youth to care for the elderly! <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of you! I'm sure they appreciated the gesture. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting to hear back about a story I submitted to a publisher. <endOfText>
<human> Fantastic! Why kind of story is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was only asleep for an hour last night and I jumped out of bed! There was this smacking noise on my window it freaked me out! <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! did you figure out what it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to Texas, but it wasn't my first choice. I am living with it though! <endOfText>
<human> Did you have to move there for a job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was home by myself when the power went out and I heard a strange noise! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sounds scary! Did you find out what it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to give a speech to over 300 people in front of my church. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's a lot of people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A buddy of mine is borrowing my car for a couple days. I figured it'd be nice to help him out but he has had a couple accidents under his belt. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, I hope he is careful with your car <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son went off to college. I found a baby picture of him and it made me sad. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. They grow up fast. Its hard to watch them leave the nest. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had entered what seemed like a fake contest a little while ago, but today I just got an air fryer in the mail! I think it was from that contest. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds cool, but also too good to be true. I hope it is true though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have spent the last two months looking after my grandfather whilst my grandmother has been in hospital, have you ever been in such a situation? <endOfText>
<human> No I haven't. You are such a great person! I wish to have grandchildren like you someday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview and I forgot a portion of what I was saying. It was a little awkward. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no ! Were you able to come up with something else to say ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My gas gauge broke in my car over the weekend. Although I had filled it up with gas, I remained adamant it had gas in it <endOfText>
<human> Tough! Are you planning on getting it fixed?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tough! Are you planning on getting it fixed? <endOfText>
<human> I did ! I brought it to the auto parts place over the weekend. They blamed it on a loose wire. Imagine that lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got married to a wonderful woman. She's been working so hard to get to where she is nowadays. She's become a very successful clinical psychologist. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you are a lucky man! Good to have a psychologist in the family too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to ask my teacher if she would mind going over a assinment again with mme <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That must have taken a lot of guts, but I hope it was worthwhile. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends invited me to a party that involved alcohol and drugs. I decided to not drink or anything because I am a Christian. <endOfText>
<human> that is probably for the best you dont want to get involved with that stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time when I was in middle school, my friend was making fun of me. So, I pulled his pants down. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! Well, I bet he quit making fun of you in light of his own embarrassment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I moved to a new town, it was hard to make new friends? <endOfText>
<human> That sounds difficult. Did you try talking to people in your neighborhood? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned a friend a good amount of money that I knew he would pay back right away. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get the money back quickly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brothers wife left him and took off with the baby. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That really sounds like your brother is going through a rough time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He is. Its hard on all of us. <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything works out, family is everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took in a small kitten I found and have been nursing her back to health <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so sweet! I love baby kittens. Are you going to keep it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband took our infant out into the world by himself today. There are so many things that could go wrong <endOfText>
<human> That's nerve wracking. I have 4 kids myself so I know what its like. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone was broke done right down the street from my house. They noticed my husbands tools in our carport and asked to borrow a $230 tool. I let them and had to trust they would bring it back. <endOfText>
<human> That's an incredible act of kindness for a stranger. Did they return the tool? Was the tool in normal shape when you got it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I have given someone I did not know who was done on their luck some money for food <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome! Did they come back and say something to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Being a married female in a male-dominated work environment can sometimes cause it's insecurities in the other partner. <endOfText>
<human> Are you able to voice your opinions at least, and are heard ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh absolutely! Thankfully, I haven't had any issues. <endOfText>
<human> You should be in a good place for advancement then, since a company has to hire so many women right ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My high school friend hit my car. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that is terrible! I guess it was their fault? What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through some trouble in the past couple years financially and mentally. I'm in a good spot now though thanks to my family and friends. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. Friends are great for support! How did they help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited for week 1 of the NFL season! Football is my favorite sport. <endOfText>
<human> I love football too! I even catch a lot of the preseason. This is one of the best times of the year. Who are you rooting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I visited a campus where I used to work, it was good to be there and I kind of missed the old times! <endOfText>
<human> Ahh, do you still have friends there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at a Korean restaurant for my birthday and the food was delicious. <endOfText>
<human> There is a Korean restaurant by my house that I've been thinking of trying. I've never had Korean food. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone pulled out in front of me and hit my car! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's terrible! Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My package never came today and I took time off to sign fo rit <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when that happens! I feel your pain. have you r=tried tracking the package online? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was out last night running and i felt my pants ripe <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were you close to home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a relatives funeral and during a rendition of Amazing Grace, I accidentally passed gas very loudly. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that. did everyone know you did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> last night was great my husband prepared me a bath and it was just what i needed <endOfText>
<human> Thats was nice of him. Did he wash your back for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won $400 in a raffle! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! You are so lucky! What was the raffle? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first baby just turned 11 yesterday. I can't believe she is a pre-teen now. I feel like she was just a baby not too long ago. <endOfText>
<human> They grow up so fast! Have you noticed differences in her personality now that she's getting older? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking of getting this polaris slingshot I have been wanting. Hence the Mturking. I'm not sure if I will be able to afford it though <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes you can. Just keep turking and you will get there for sure even if you have to work extra hours in the night. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's true! I wish I could find something else that pays better. <endOfText>
<human> You can manifest anything your heart desires. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went camping with my husband and he forgot to grab his overnight bag. Luckily, I had a list and made sure to grab it for him. <endOfText>
<human> That's great that you were able to anticipate his needs. I try to do the same for my husband. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i began class the other day this one kid did not bring their supplies so i gave them some extra i had <endOfText>
<human> That was a nice thing to do. It is always good to be kind to others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this guy cut me off today and we were in traffic <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came to work today ready for whatever it through at me <endOfText>
<human> that is good! you should always do that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt realize a truck would be through at me. Destroyed about a 4rd of the building <endOfText>
<human> wow that is crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i cleaned my parents attic and found all my old kids toys! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! That must be so much fun to see all that stuff again. Maybe they are collectors items now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> E must have been off his meds or something <endOfText>
<human> Why? Did he do something erratic or dangerous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The movie Clueless was a big part of my teenage years. I got to watch it with my niece last week! <endOfText>
<human> Thats a good movie! so many classic themes from that area. How did it make you feel?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats a good movie! so many classic themes from that area. How did it make you feel? <endOfText>
<human> It made me remember how hard the teenage years are for everyone. It was fun though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so last night my football team lost it was awful <endOfText>
<human> Sports Fan are you !  I've lost many bets / honey do challenges to my football team as well ! I hope you feel better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel at peace when my best friend, my dog, is near me <endOfText>
<human> That is good is he a sweet dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have been studing all week and have a test I have to pass on Friday <endOfText>
<human> I sure you will do well if you are already studying.  What subject is it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor just purchased a new truck while i'm still riding around in my 2005 Honda Accord ! <endOfText>
<human> Well at least yours is paid off and he is still paying on his <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won $25 on a lottery ticket and when I went out to cash it, I lost it! I tried to find it but it was gone. <endOfText>
<human> oh man what a bummer! i hate when things like that happen! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too. I was going to put that $25 in my gas tank. <endOfText>
<human> keep your head up im sure another lucky break will come along! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> lately it has been tough for me to put aside money to pay tithing to my church, but i have been able to keep up with it still. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have to get a second job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm glad you found a way to work it out! <endOfText>
<human> thanks me too! i really feel like things in my life fall into place when i keep paying my tithes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that was real nice of you to let your sister's friend borrow money from you. <endOfText>
<human> Um...are you talking about yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking with one of my coworkers yesterday and told them a secret. <endOfText>
<human> do you think that they would tell the secret? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello!  I decided to try and make dinner from a new recipe. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so  hungry. What are you cooking up special today ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next time we have a Hurricane pass this way, I'll certainly be ready ... <endOfText>
<human> Me too! We are ready and waiting here in Florida.  What have you done to prepare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my driver licence test agian to get them back. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> can vividly remember the first time my dad took the training wheels off of my bicycle <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting. Do you remember if you fell or not? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt know how I was going to pay my car insurance last month. If it got canceled, I wouldnt be able to drive to work! <endOfText>
<human> Well.. LOL, In Mississippi, LOTS of people drive without auto insurance ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this kitten that was poking around my house, and I felt bad for it because it was very hot outside. <endOfText>
<human> Awww!  Was its momma nearby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im waiting for a test work to come back and im kinda sweating it <endOfText>
<human> I hope the results are good. What were you getting tested for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a rural school out in the middle of nowhere. I had to transfer due to how overwhelmingly exclusive it was. <endOfText>
<human> did your parents have to pay to send you elsewere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I was going through my son's memory box and I found his report card from 4th grade. He was always in some kind of mischief. Always makes me smile to read these memories. <endOfText>
<human> They grow up so quickly!  How old is he now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my sons school for an event. A child threw up right in front of me. <endOfText>
<human> wow that must be gross, i know it would make me feel like throwing up too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im so upset my neighbors do not clean up after there dogs <endOfText>
<human> thats not neighborly of them. i would be upset too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you ever cheated on a diet? <endOfText>
<human> yeah i think everyone has <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well for the past week ive been on a diet and i havent cheated.. so proud of myself. <endOfText>
<human> That is good most people have a hard time in the first week <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a kid i was afraid to sleep in my room because of my closet <endOfText>
<human> Did you think a ghoul or monster were in there? I had similar fears growing up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't been getting much sleep lately. Part of my rent on a farm property I live on is making sure hunters don't sneak onto the property. They always sneak in at the worst times. <endOfText>
<human> Have you set up cameras to monitor the property? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always like making sure I am ready for anything! I always pack a ton of food when I am on long car rides. <endOfText>
<human> I used to do the same thing when I went on long trips.  I would also bring extra things like blankets if it was winter. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too!! I also started wearing disposable underwear so I don't have to make any pit stops. I love being ready for anything. <endOfText>
<human> You're so lucky!  I would do the same, except they don't make them in my size. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In JR High, there was this kid who was always throwing apples at birds in the air. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible! Why would he do something like that??? Did you do anything to stop him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store last week, which is 30 miles away from my house, and when I got home, I discovered I was overcharged by $20. That made me mad! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible! Did you call and tell management? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot my brothers birthday and I tried to cover it up but he knew. I called him the next day but it wasn't the same. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate when that happens. Happens to me all the time. Did he forgive you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So  last Halloween i ate all my kids candy while they were asleep <endOfText>
<human> that sounded like an ambitious endeavor, you must have felt sick afterwards <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Right now I have my cat next to me, Infinity War on TV, and some spiced rum in my glass. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really good right about now!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds really good right about now! <endOfText>
<human> You got that right.  Can't ask for anything better after a long Monday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a flood in our basement and I lost a bunch of old photos. <endOfText>
<human> Man I bet you were devastated did you lose anything else? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my girlfriend got mad at me and destroyed my new car with a bat and knocked out my windshield. <endOfText>
<human> OMG!  That's insane.  How did you react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ah, I often think back to when my husband and I first met and started dating. It was so long ago, yet feels like it was only yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds wonderful!  Time flies, doesn't it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it does. So many good times and good memories. <endOfText>
<human> How long have you and he been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, I thought I had breast cancer. It was such a scary time, but I tried to think positive. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were terrified!  Did everything turn out okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my son with a baby sitter for the first time recently. <endOfText>
<human> Awww. I remember the first time I left my son with the babysitter. So many emotions. How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been talk to someone for quite a while and we finally expressed feeling for each other. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful!  Do they feel the same way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish I lived in Manhattan. My friend got lucky enough to get a job and move there. <endOfText>
<human> Manhattan would be a great place to live. you'll love it there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you ever received a bad hair do? <endOfText>
<human> Yes several times. I usually just end up cutting the hair shorter to get over it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got a awful haircut today, all i can do is put on a hat. just burns me up. <endOfText>
<human> I bet, I'm sorry you got one. All I can recommend is cutting it shorter and let it grow back out. Or find a cool hat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah, im gonna have to go shorter, i realize everyone can't do hair. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it is a solid art for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> and i still had to pay her. i feel like i got hustled. <endOfText>
<human> I'd try to get a refund! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom got scammed out of hundreds of dollars. <endOfText>
<human> Dude! That sucks! I am so sorry about that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad growing up. I always wanted a horse and my parents never got me one. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad, did you ever get to ride horses at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, I never did. That made me real sad as well. <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope you get to be around horses someday!  I don't know much about them but they're so cool. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some one broke into my hose and stole a old record player I had. <endOfText>
<human> wow that must be scary to have someone break into your house <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Grrr! I just found out someone got my credit card info. They charged a couple of hundreds of dollars on it. <endOfText>
<human> oh my gosh, did you actually lose the card? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nope. :( It's such a pain too. Having to contact the credit card company and get a new card issued. <endOfText>
<human> It is I have had that happen with 2 of my cards and my debit card. I managed to track down through the charges who used the cards <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been married and had someone hit on me recently, he was pretty good looking <endOfText>
<human> Oh, you go girl! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww, what a sweet woman you are. There aren't too many like you out there anymore. <endOfText>
<human> You have to think about your family, your kids, all of those you would hurt, for what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent a couple hundred dollars on a purse, which is A LOT for me, and it started fraying in days. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I would be furious, to say the least <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This week, I ran 60 miles in total.  After I finished up my long run on Sunday I just sat around for the rest of the day. <endOfText>
<human> i don't blame you for siting around all day. 60 miles, I do't think i walk that in year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have some blood work recently to see if I had cancer... It was so nerve wracking waiting for the results. <endOfText>
<human> oh that is terrible, it feels like your life is changing so fast, did everything turn out ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. Yes, it turns out I didn't have cancer. I was so relieved. <endOfText>
<human> that is a scary situation, so glad everything turned out ok <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one day my car would not start, apprehensively I went to a close by home and knocked on the door <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That sucks. Good thing you were close to home.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. That sucks. Good thing you were close to home. <endOfText>
<human> it wasent my home, but a strangers home, I knocked on the door and a very large tattooed man answered <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! That sounds scary. <endOfText>
<human> super scary, then he asked me to come on in!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> one time I saw an abandoned dog so I took him in and bottle fed him until he was way better to be adopted <endOfText>
<human> that is so kind of you, we once adopted an abandon dog <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my gosh! I was outside the other day, and what did my eyes see? A rattlesnake! Ack! I was never so terrified in my life! <endOfText>
<human> Those are nothing to mess around with. They can be deadly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes they can. Thank goodness my husband was home and killed that sucker! <endOfText>
<human> No kidding. I would hate to have to come face to face with one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost her oldest son in a car wreck a few days ago. I can't imagine the pain she is feeling. <endOfText>
<human> OMG that is horrible! :( Im sure she needs you right now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got spayed in the face with wound juices <endOfText>
<human> That is really gross. How did that happen?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> lol. We ran out of face shields and she accidentally sprayed me in the face. <endOfText>
<human> I don't think I would help again unless someone found me a face shield. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love playing table tennis, so I was pretty sure I was going to beat my Dad last time I played him. <endOfText>
<human> Table tennis is a wonderful game. Did you beat him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my goodness! I was really stressed out the other night and ate a whole container of ice cream by myself. <endOfText>
<human> A delicious delicacy! Why were you stressed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really hard test coming up and was afraid I wasn't going to pass it. I felt so bad afterwards eating all that ice cream. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! Bummer. Yeah stress gets to me too! Did you end up passing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my dog off the leash in the park the other day and he never strayed too far from me the whole time. He came any time I called him and is such a good boy! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great dog! what bread is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He is a cream color Labrador <endOfText>
<human> Labs are known for their loyalty and obedience. I bet he is a great companion  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel nervous most of the time but when my regional boss comes into town it gets pretty bad <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds awful. Just makes things worse when they show up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah im afraid i will make a bad impression and loose my job. The worst things possible always plays through my head <endOfText>
<human> Well it sounds like you've done alright so far I'm sure the worst is behind you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boys made me so happy last year. They both came 1800 miles away to visit me at Christmas. <endOfText>
<human> That was super nice of them, I bet it was a big surprise as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, it was. It was one of the happiest days of my life. My one son also got me a kitchenaid for Christmas. <endOfText>
<human> I love my kitchenaid. It has to be my most used appliance. I can see why you were so happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A coworker of the opposite sex was recently hitting on me and trying to get me to cheat on my partner. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that little rat! That was not nice of him. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awesome! There needs to be more people like you in this world. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, people are not very faithful anymore. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt sad that I was not asked to be the bridesmaid at a close friends wedding <endOfText>
<human> That is unfortunate, how long have you been friends with this person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I wasn't too sure about letting my dog off his leash but he seemed to be doing really well recently so I let him off and he was quite obedient and never strayed too far away from me! <endOfText>
<human> You are so lucky ! I still keep my 9 month old fur baby on a leash. What breed is your dog ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was playing a game recently and it reminded me of old times playing with my grandpa. We'd play Chess for so many hours. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats so sweet that he taught you to play, he sounds like he was a sweet grandpa. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am starting a new job and am so nervous but equally excited. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I hope you do well in your new job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been going to the same Thai restaurant for about 10 years now. It's the best and they always keep me coming back each week! <endOfText>
<human> they probably think you are part of the Thai family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I buy a lottery ticket every week. No luck so far but I'll keep trying. <endOfText>
<human> I do the same. At least we're contributing to somebody's fortune. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dream of winning. I need to break this cycle of living paycheck-to-paycheck. <endOfText>
<human> You and me both. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids started school last Tuesday and no school supply lists were put out online or in stores. I didn't get a list until 4 days before school started. I had to send them to school with no supplies until I could afford to buy them some on Friday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that sounds terrible. I would hate to have such a financial burden suddenly sprang on me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was cleaning up some old papers and I found something I wasn't expecting to see. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what did you find? hopefully not something ebarassing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I am feeling so proud of my dog today. <endOfText>
<human> that sounds great, what did your dog do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Guess what, I was really surprised today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh? What surprised you about today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I've been driving my friend's mom to and from the hospital for her chemo treatments. My friend is in the military and she can't drive so it's about the only way for her to get there. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that is very sweet, kind and thoughtful of you! Has it been troubling for you because I am sure you also have a busy schedule <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my mom gave me some earrings when i got married, they have been in our family for a long time. i was surprised that she trusted me with them. <endOfText>
<human> That's a nice gesture of her. It's nice that she trusts you like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i know, i couldn't believe it myself. i thought she would've given them to my sister. <endOfText>
<human> Well obviously you're the more deserving one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I was sitting outside relaxing with a drink in my backyard and just felt quite at peace with things and enjoyed the nice weather. <endOfText>
<human> i love peaceful moments while relaxing. i bet that moment was much needed . i really like nature too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You will never guess what just happened! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I can't wait to hear! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lent a stranger my phone and he dashed off with it!! I am so angry! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you trusted he would give it back and then he didn't. I can understand how angry you'd be! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have a new member of our family! <endOfText>
<human> Are we?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Are we? <endOfText>
<human> Huh? Anyway, the new member is a bunny! My daughter rescued it from an animal shelter. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> once I was in a drive-by shooting <endOfText>
<human> Oh dang that sounds really scary. I'm assuming that since you're still here that you are okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently my dog got out of the yard and ran to the neighbors and ran all around their house upsetting their dogs! It was quite annoying but eventually he came to me after I called to him for a bit. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too. I'd be so mad at him for getting out though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had a dog that got sick and vomited in the house? <endOfText>
<human> Omg my current dog does that sometimes. She pukes up bile if she doesn't eat, so I always have to make sure she is eating her food. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently went on vacation. <endOfText>
<human> Oh Fun! where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im Not the best looking guy ok. At a party I went up to the hottest girl in the room and started chatting with her <endOfText>
<human> That must have taken a lot of courage. What happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> she was nice but totally uninterested. I was proud I was able to do it though. <endOfText>
<human> That's great that you could do it. Maybe next time will go better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so ashamed today! :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> walked into my office late and in the middle of a important meeting <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man.  That's a terrible feeling. What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> On my way to work I say a guy doing a trick on his bicycle. It was pretty rad <endOfText>
<human> that must be cool to see, something to break up the monotony of the day <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You will never guess what I found today in the attic! <endOfText>
<human> what it is? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is embarrassing falling in the sewer because of texting while walking. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, please tell me that did not happen to you today. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> not today but last week. Its funny but embarrassing <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I hope you were alright! But yes that is a funny story to tell your friends :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man... i just lost the championship game for my football team <endOfText>
<human> You must feel terrible. That sucks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found a bat living in my sunroom! He seemed to be there for a few weeks now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that is interesting. I assume he leaves at night to go eat, since he's still alive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to staff at a teen camp and I had to prepare mentally and physically. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how was that? I've never been to camp. Was it fun at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been to Six flags? <endOfText>
<human> I have been to Six Flags as a matter of fact.  I cant say that I enjoyed it much, as I hate to ride rides.  WHat about you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview a while back, and on the bus ride over, I sat on some gum. <endOfText>
<human> Omg, that had to be embarrassing and a mess to get up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a few years back i was addicted to drugs and alcohol... i could not take care of my responsibilities... <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you're feeling better. I'm sorry you went through that, I hear that addition is tough and often starts after having a major surgical operation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm glad you got the help you needed and ended up in an actually helpful rehab. It's always good when you have control of the things in your life. Just remember to stay strong when things get tough again and to lean on your support structure. <endOfText>
<human> i will! a lot depends on the person in rehab and the attitude they have in there! thanks it was great talking to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling a little sad lately <endOfText>
<human> Aww, why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy!! <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad to hear it. What's got you so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read the driving permit booklet probably 10 times cover to cover, before I ended up taking the actual test. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! that is some real dedication you have! Did you manage to pass the test?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! that is some real dedication you have! Did you manage to pass the test? <endOfText>
<human> I did! I did tremendously, got them all right. I think I went a little overkill, to be honest.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I totally made a fool of myself at Walmart the other day, I was wearing a white outfit and there was a very attractive man in front of me and I tripped and fell. <endOfText>
<human> Haha! Poor you. Did you wreck your clothes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally had expired milk today and it tasted gross. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet, probably made you feel sick to your stomach after. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think so. I didn't have that much, thankfully, or else I would've probably spent the day vomiting. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, easy to quickly notice that awful taste. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You will never guess what happened today! I am so embarrassed!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped over a man's foot and landed right on top of a very grumpy man who shoved me into another guy! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Where did all of this take place? Sounds like a rough part of town?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was so weird watching As Told By Ginger and Hey Arnold and the Rugrats the other day, I had such a nostalgic feel <endOfText>
<human> I only used to watch Rugrats, and I still can't stand that show.  It was like the decline of the NIck lineup.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I only used to watch Rugrats, and I still can't stand that show.  It was like the decline of the NIck lineup. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, I loved it, by I tried letting my kids watch it and the ywould not have it, they were like what is this weird stuff haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite day of the week has been Wednesdays for the last few years. <endOfText>
<human> Wednesdays, why is that? I used to love Wednesdays because we always got out of school an hour early <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling a little jealous lately :( <endOfText>
<human> Aw, why is that?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so jealous of my friend, Mary, she has finally got accepted into Medical school, but I am still waiting on my application to be approved. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's hard but I'm sure you will get yours too. It's hard being patient though when others get theirs before you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw, why is that? <endOfText>
<human> I am so jealous of my friend, Mary, she has finally got accepted into Medical school, but I am still waiting on my application to be approved.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever stole candy from the store when you were a kid? <endOfText>
<human> Probably not, but I don't remember. I was always a scaredy cat as a baby. Have you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview for a hospital I want to volunteer at but I felt a little under-qualified <endOfText>
<human> That is not good what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't heard back from them yet! Hopefully they email me soon because I would love to volunteer at a hospital. <endOfText>
<human> Well I hope you here back from them and they will give good news. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old roommate got a boyfriend, and obviously, she started spending a lot more time with him than at our apartment. <endOfText>
<human> That happened my freshman year with my best friend. It really sucks at first, but eventually you get used to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for tomorrow night! <endOfText>
<human> What is happening tomorrow night? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is going to be a formal dance party! I have been practicing my dance moves all night and doing my make up! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I hope you have a great time at the party! Have some fun for the both of us! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid, I went on a few trips to the Mountain for some snowboarding lessons, come Christmas time you bet I was just praying for a snowboard of my own <endOfText>
<human> Did you ever get your own snowboard ? It looks like so much fun ! I see people on tv, where they are flying off mountain sides ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm SO afraid of my neighbors new pit bull ! Every morning our neighbor lets out the dog - he immediately heads towards MY driveway to get MY newspaper, runs off and tears it to shreds ! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, letting the dog roam free even when it's so new to the neighborhood? That seems like recipe for disaster. Your poor newspaper.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been really hopeful about the future lately! :) <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Have you been getting lucky recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling very angry lately! You will never guess what happened. <endOfText>
<human> do tell,  what happened was it bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bad experince when I was a kid when my dog ran away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, were you able to find your dog again?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, were you able to find your dog again? <endOfText>
<human> Yes when I came home the next day my mom had found him and boy was I happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I cosigned on my boyfriend's apartment a few year's back to make up for his horrible credit. <endOfText>
<human> How did that work out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In the 8th grade, my friend and I sold the most chocolate bars in our entire school. Our prize ultimately ended up being a pair of New Balance shoes. $1150 in sales, for a pair of $25 kids shoes, each. <endOfText>
<human> I would not of been happy with that were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Bleh, I just had the worst food ever. <endOfText>
<human> What did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at cMdonalds and was given a rotten cheese burger. I almost puked after I ate it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross, makes me never want McDonalds again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so disappointed in myself! <endOfText>
<human> Why! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother took my favorite tanktop from me to play basketball when we were both teenagers. He ended up getting into a scuffle with someone at the courts, and the shirt got torn in two.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did he replace it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so guilty... :( <endOfText>
<human> Why? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my dog alone at home all day because I had to go support my friend at a charity event. It lasted a lot longer than I anticipated <endOfText>
<human> Dang! Your dog must have been so excited to see you come back! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally stepped on someone's toe at the grocery store and they really looked like they were in pain <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you ask if they were alright and apologize?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, did you ask if they were alright and apologize? <endOfText>
<human> Of course! I probably apologized 20 times. I felt so guilty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, how did he take it? <endOfText>
<human> He looked like he understood that I was really sorry and that it was an accident but he couldn't help but grab his foot in pain!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you know that I am actually terrified of the ocean? <endOfText>
<human> I am a little too. Why are you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling very happy lately! :) <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Nothing like stringing together a long streak of feeling happy in the world. Anything in particular got you chipper? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, my boyfriend and I have finally started to get serious in or relationship. We have even started talking about marriage and children! :) <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's tremendous. Those are big steps, but if ever there is a good-sign of a relationship, it's when those topics are approached happily. Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> First time I ever went to a traditional Japanese cook-house I couldn't believe to variety of food. Moreover, I couldn't believe the variety of food that was still moving... <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I know what you ean! I have been to one before too and it was awesome!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I know what you ean! I have been to one before too and it was awesome! <endOfText>
<human> All of the food tasted so good, but I couldn't get over how recently they killed the courses. Still-moving octopus? No thank you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a kid, me and my friends would often try to find haunted houses in the old part of town. Can't quite explain that one night where I swear I saw something moving around in one of them. It felt and looked so real <endOfText>
<human> I have had an experience like that. I do believe in ghosts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know what's more terrifying, whether it was a ghost or that there was someone still inside.. <endOfText>
<human> Could be either! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> During a drive from Seattle to Los Angeles in the winter, I got stuck in my car because they closed a pass because of heavy snow. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh that's no fun especially with it being so cold. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt that I had not seen in 10 years came to visit me last weekend <endOfText>
<human> Wow. What for? Had you recently talked to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. I hadn't seen her in so long because she lived in Cuba for all those years. She recently moved to Spain and wanted to visit my family and I. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you guys had a lot of catching up to do! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so proud of my puppy! <endOfText>
<human> Aww! what for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He learned two new tricks today. I was able to teach him to give me a highfive and roll over! he is the cutest pup! :) <endOfText>
<human> My dog needs some good training! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so grateful that I have great friends :) <endOfText>
<human> Friends really are the best part of life, I'd say. I can't imagine what I'd do without some of those folks in my life.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I totally agree, the other day when I was at the bar, my best friend was so kind to make sure I got home safe after I had a little too uch to drink :) <endOfText>
<human> That's a good friends right there. Looking out for your best interests is a sign that they're truly a keeper. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Friends really are the best part of life, I'd say. I can't imagine what I'd do without some of those folks in my life. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I totally agree, the other day when I was at the bar, my best friend was so kind to make sure I got home safe after I had a little too uch to drink :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A school friend of mine got detention for a week after he was caught with a note that had some swear words in it. I was the one that passed it to him.. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did he place the blame on you, or did he just accept it and take the blame for you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He was a courageous one, and took the fall himself. Which actually made me feel even worse, but it taught me a lesson about integrity and honor. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that just shows that he is a great friend. Maybe you can treat him to lunch for the rest of the week for taking the fall for you. I am sure he would really appreciate that :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, did he place the blame on you, or did he just accept it and take the blame for you? <endOfText>
<human> He was a courageous one, and took the fall himself. Which actually made me feel even worse, but it taught me a lesson about integrity and honor.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son recently got married, and I gained a new daughter in law. The wedding was beautiful, everyone had a great time ! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awesome. Do you like her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i didn't cheat on my partner. <endOfText>
<human> That's good! Cheating is not good for a relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know it is hard to be an immigrant and be alone and far from your family <endOfText>
<human> I cannot imagine. Where from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am originally from Chile, but I live in Canada. It is sad to be alone for Christmas, new year or my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Can you facetime them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to borrow money from family, I hate having to rely on them but debt was just piling up <endOfText>
<human> I understand. I have had to do that before. My family was very giving. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever watched the Bachelor? <endOfText>
<human> No, I haven't. I've heard of it, though. What is it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so annoyed with my brother...ugh sometimes I wish I was an only child. <endOfText>
<human> I would think that being an only child would be somewhat boring and lonely.   HOw bad can it be with your brother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He borrowed my lucky pencil when he knew I had an important test today. And he knows I can't function without my lucky pencil during a test! :( <endOfText>
<human> That's not cool!  I hope you did well in spite of not having your lucky pencil.  Siblings can be quite pesky at times! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I went to downtown with an old pant and when I was in the street the pant ripped <endOfText>
<human> Wow, did anyone see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I attended a bachelor party this summer. Things got a little out of hand. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A while back, someone who was a good friend accused me of a crime that I didn't commit. <endOfText>
<human> Why would they do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got called into the bosses office last week. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, hope it wasn't serious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i believed a friend who was always telling me lies <endOfText>
<human> That must have really hurt. When did you realize he was always lying to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a car accident. I cant walk anymore. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry. That is horrific. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I visited to Greece and was amazed by all the beautiful landscape I saw! <endOfText>
<human> I had never visited there. But it reminds me of Athenas and that old cities <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do u remember the name of that Island? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it is called Mykonos. It's a very touristic location. <endOfText>

<human> Aw, that is really sweet of him. What did the note say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow. That is incredibly romantic. You're a lucky girl! <endOfText>
<human> yeah. I feel loved <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I volunteered to babysit my neighbor's children. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to go for nice long walks in the park with my dog. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, how long do you usually take your dog for a walk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was beaten by my ex, when I was pregnant of his child. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry! Report him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We made the most amazing meal tonight <endOfText>
<human> What did you make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh man I can't wait for next week! <endOfText>
<human> Why!? What happens next week? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Stuffed animals are always an endearing thing to hang on to. <endOfText>
<human> They are. I have several. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> god, im at the lowest point i've ever been in my life <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry. You should talk to a therapist. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I'm really happy that I'm able to attend a university and get an education on something I'm passionate about <endOfText>
<human> Congregation but what are you passionate about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I traveled out of the country for the first time last year. <endOfText>

<human> whoa that's nuts. how many did you have to kick to get out alive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a really good night last night after a lot of stress <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to unwind after a tough day. How did you celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh god ugh, I am so revolted right now <endOfText>
<human> Oh shoot, why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought I saw my friend at the store but when I said hi, it turned out to be a stranger. I went red in the face. <endOfText>
<human> how'd they react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didnt want anyone to talk with my boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished my final exams and have been constantly checking my phone to see if the marks have been uploaded. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, Do you think you did well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is truly been trustworthy, she never keep secret from me". <endOfText>
<human> Have you ever kept secrets from her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no intention of cheating on my partner and I hope they know this. <endOfText>
<human> Its good you made that decision <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just hope that they realise that. I would hate for them to ever feel unsure or insecure. <endOfText>
<human> Who are they you are referring <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine recently had their car breakdown. <endOfText>
<human> Dang! Did they get home safely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> : "My wife knows I could seldom lie to her,she can vouch for me". <endOfText>
<human> It's good that your wife trusts you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a phone, cards and money in the washroom at the mall. I gave it back in customer services <endOfText>
<human> THat is extremely noble of you!   YOu did the right thing!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> man I feel kind of bad for something that I did <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to meet up with someone to sell a belonging, but they flaked. I wasted my time! <endOfText>
<human> Dang, was it from craigslist? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently purchased a Nintendo Switch and playing it reminded me of my childhood playing games with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> Dang! What kind of games did you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am praying that I did well on my exams. <endOfText>
<human> praying won't do anything, but did you study well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> man, I can't believe how fast my best friend was in the 5k today <endOfText>
<human> Did he exceed your expectations? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is one of the best on earth, I feel proud to have such a wonderful family <endOfText>
<human> Family is one of the most important things to have in life.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Family is one of the most important things to have in life. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, just like my. Am so favoured, we shear so much love <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> do you havde children I do and my little girl made aF- on her spelling test last week. <endOfText>
<human> Yes I do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Has your house ever been caught in a flood or natural disaster? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, Hurricane Harvey destroyed my city! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We have 100 people coming over soon to pray over my sister and her house. I'm excited! <endOfText>
<human> I bet you are , So did she just purchase a new house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has been away visting her mother for 3 weeks now. <endOfText>
<human> Wow - that's a significant amount of time! How has that been for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son wet his pants at the park the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! I hope that he did not feel badly about it. That sort of thing is normal for children <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will be meeting my mom again after she went missing for 30 years. Meeting her soon, and I'm not sure if she still loves me or not. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing! A parent will always love their children regardless of past decisions. How did you find her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> do you have any kids in college? <endOfText>
<human> No. I have kids, but they are toddlers. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my boyfriend sometimes looks at his ex instagram or facebook. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that makes you angry , mine use to do the same thing and it made me furious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I blocked my ex from social media. But sometimes he watches my ex facebooks and instagram too. <endOfText>
<human> HJow do you put up with it , I Know I could not do it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well, life's looking pretty crappy for me now.....sigh <endOfText>
<human> What!? What's going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> god, I am going to SMACK my brother right now!!!! <endOfText>
<human> Why? Did he do something terrible? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> man, I was just looking through my parents wedding album.....I can't believe how young they were <endOfText>
<human> Dang! Do you look like your parents? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> many years ago when my wife and i first moved in with each other there were lots of debates about money <endOfText>
<human> Financial stress can be a major burden. How did you get over this issue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has a male friend she always confides in. I do not feel like she should discuss some of our personal issues with him. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. It took me many years before I learned to have complete faith in my wife. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great advice I truly appreciate it. I love her to death and we recently had our first child together. <endOfText>
<human> Love her while you can and enjoy your life together. Children grow up fast, i have two, a six year old girl and a nine year old boy. They are handfuls <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before any meeting I always make sure I am ready in case the boss calls on me. <endOfText>
<human> Does your boss call on you a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If one of my customers has an issue I always find them an answer. <endOfText>
<human> That's really kind of you. What good customer service! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I participated in a marathon with my friend last week <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is impressive! how long did you train for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son recently was jumping on the couch and broke it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Did you punish him or anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe in my son, I know he will make me proud when his result will be out". <endOfText>
<human> result for what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been cliff jumping before? <endOfText>
<human> Nope, it is too scary for me! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In High School I loved to play sports. Football was my favorite <endOfText>
<human> ah I was never much of a sports guy, but I do work out a lot. do you still play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no oh yes oh no oh yes!!! <endOfText>
<human> What is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> : "I am fully ready for my exams which is starting next week <endOfText>
<human> Wow what kind of exams are you taking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sick, but I needed some milk, so I let my neighbor take my credit card to the store to get some. <endOfText>
<human> That's very trusting. Did they come back with the milk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, he got the milk and brought the receipt to show that's all he bought. <endOfText>
<human> Good for them. Nice to know that there are good people left in the world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trusted my brother would pay back the loan I gave him <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it can get tricky when family and money are involved. Did he pay you back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh man! I hope it all works out for you. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks. I appreciate it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very angry, my boss embarrassed me for nothing". <endOfText>
<human> what'd he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dad bit someone <endOfText>
<human> Who did he bit <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got home from the hospital and we carried with us my first child! <endOfText>
<human> Wow congrats! Is it a boy or a girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently passed up for another promotion at work. <endOfText>
<human> I hope there was a good reason for that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I truly am starting to think my boss hates me. He never gives me the good assignments and always degrades my work. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should talk face to face with him next time you see him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> maybe you shouldn't have gone in that room. <endOfText>
<human> Why? what is in that room? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided one day that I would adopt an animal at an animal shelter, and I picked up a dog. <endOfText>
<human> Cute!!! what did you name it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad wants me to work this job that I am completely uninterested in. <endOfText>
<human> Have you voiced your opinion to him yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. He is very stubborn though and wants me to live the life he believes is best for me. <endOfText>
<human> Parents always think they know best. Until their children prove them wrong they tend to think that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still believe my hubby will remember our anniversary, cos he always forget". <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. are you angry at him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is helping out with the money for my marriage ceremony! <endOfText>
<human> you're very lucky to have such family! when are you getting married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so prepared for the track meet. I spent the previous 4 years getting ready for it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is a long time! How did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found out I need a root canal <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Have you ever had one before? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year I took a trip to Mexico and basically hung out on the beach for a week. <endOfText>
<human> You are so lucky,i have been long for such a break for so long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have everything I need in life. My girlfriend is amazing my son is kind and I have a new baby girl <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing! It is nice to hear that things are going so well for you and your family! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accepted a job in a career field that I know I am not interested in. <endOfText>
<human> Is it just temporary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I am just accepting it for the time being. Just taking the position for the money. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes things are a necessary evil. And who knows as long as you keep your options open the perfect job may be right around the corner. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I fell down on stage while dancing, I felt so bad". <endOfText>
<human> oh dear, that must've been embarrassing, are you okay though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend got me a new fridge for my bday! I am super happy. <endOfText>
<human> Girl,you are so lucky. You got a good one. better things are on the way for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my grandmother is so sweet, I love helping her :) <endOfText>
<human> it's nice to have someone who can help you always, i'm pretty sure she loves having you by her side always <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> she probably appreciate you so much for doing that. <endOfText>
<human> yeah and I bring her my best weed and she loves it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My landlords do not approve of dogs in my house so I had to leave my dog with my parents. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. I can't have dogs in my apartment either. Why won't they let you have one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently going through some cupboards and I found my old school tie and some photos. I'm not really someone who holds onto things, and I hated school, I don't really know why I kept them. <endOfText>
<human> Do they have any sentimental value for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I was having a couple of drinks with a friend and we started roughhousing and I broke my tailbone <endOfText>
<human> Wow, did you fall on your butt that hard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I was offered a new job but I dont know if I will take it. I am scared to leave my current job. <endOfText>
<human> why are you scared of leaving your current job? if you have been offered a better job then just leave you know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an hectic interview ,I really don't know what to expect ,I'm curious to know what's next". <endOfText>
<human> What made it hectic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really embarrassed at school one day when I made a fool out of myself in front of my crush <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This one time, a girl I've known for a long time lost her place to stay. She had a lot of cats but, I let her crash at my place for a while. <endOfText>
<human> What about the cats though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> mmmmm I just had the best meal and I'm super full <endOfText>
<human> What have you eaten? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You are living life. <endOfText>
<human> yep and now I'm going to sleep like a baby <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ok, buckle up this one's sad. My fiance died when i was 18 <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into a fight with my wife lately and we were so mad with each other. <endOfText>
<human> At least you have a wife. Probably would if it weren't for fights over dumb things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drove past a lonely road where is a hideout for criminals". <endOfText>
<human> Did you feel scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked a woman to keep an eye on my bag whilst I went to the toilet. <endOfText>
<human> Uhmnnn,you really did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My employer provides me with lots of training and support so I have become very faithful to them. <endOfText>
<human> It's always good to have a boss you can get along with.  It makes work a lot less stressful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You wanna know the most contented and peaceful time of day? <endOfText>
<human> Tell me more,i would love to know! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Drinking hot coffee outside. Your only company; the morning dew and the rising sun <endOfText>
<human> Perfect state of mind.  I will take that any day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well, my friend won the lottery <endOfText>
<human> your friend is probably one of the luckiest people on earth. how do you feel about it/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well, you know everything happens for a reason. <endOfText>
<human> to make me mad, yeah! he better give me a bunch of it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Would you like to hear about one of the most anxious and exciting times of my life? <endOfText>
<human> of course I would <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to work with a partner for my senior thesis and he did nothing! Do you like group work? <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hate group work for that exact reason. I'd rather just have company while I did the work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Remember our beautiful dog at home? Well unfortunately he did recently. The family are so so sad. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear about your dog. What happened to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At least he lived a long, happy life. <endOfText>
<human> He did. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job and had to ask my parents for money. I was so ashamed to ask for help. <endOfText>
<human> i'm pretty sure they were more than happy to help you because they are your parents in the end. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I would say Karma is due to bring me some good positive vibes today <endOfText>
<human> You are so hyped for the day. I wish that will be the same for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, my best friend did something I had a very hard time forgiving him for <endOfText>
<human> mind telling me what happened maybe i could help you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remained with my girl after a long distance relationship <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I never did a long distance one. But my brother did, and it was about 400 miles. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well, it's time. I'm going to ask the girl of my dreams out on a date <endOfText>
<human> That's a good idea! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I'm a musician and I recently had a really gratifying situation <endOfText>
<human> Great, what happend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it's time. I'm ready to go on the hardest mountain climb I've ever done <endOfText>
<human> sounds like a good adventure! where are you going to climb? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had always colored my hair at home but had a wedding comeing up so I wanted to finally get it done professionally. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it turned out great. Did you find a good hairdresser to do your hair? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental around Christmas. Christmases with my parents were the best but now they're gone. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so sorry to hear that, how long have they been gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time I got pantsed in PE class. The other girls thought I should lose my pants while we were playing dodgeball. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been embarrassing. Did the girls get in trouble for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom found my weed when I was younger <endOfText>
<human> Did she punish you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh boy....I just screwed my whole life up and I want to die <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Hopefully things right themselves for you soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time my friend dropped something heavy on my favorite guitar <endOfText>
<human> Was the guitar okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The most awful time of my life was when my wife went to jail for a month. I'm glad it's all over. <endOfText>
<human> holy cow! Why did she go to jail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you ever think you know someone and then you go to their house and find out their a HOARDER@ <endOfText>
<human> Woah, I never had that happen to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was really tough to watch my father struggle with cancer. When he got the diagnosys I was devastated for him. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure that was difficult.  How is he now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son wanted the tips of his new hair curt dyed blonde to start school. <endOfText>
<human> How did the school feel about it? Don't they have strict rules about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We took a big leap of faith with our teenage son this weekend. We left him home overnight alone for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that would have scared me, how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been a teacher for over 10 years. But have only taught the little kids. This year my district moved me up to the high school. <endOfText>
<human> That's a really big change, are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got into a fight with my brother this weekend. I said some things I shouldn't have said. <endOfText>
<human> if you regret what you did you should go apologise for you said to him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did apologize but I still can't shake the feeling that I went too far. I'm not proud of how I acted at all. <endOfText>
<human> i hope he can forgive you and help you forget about what you said. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so naive and trusting in the past and people took advantage of me a lot. I'm a lot more careful now. <endOfText>
<human> you'll need to be careful around me then. I'm the type of person who takes advantage of people <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well, I have faith that everything will turn out okay today. it's a big day <endOfText>
<human> Why? What's happening today?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Why? What's happening today? <endOfText>
<human> getting the results back on whether I have lymphoma or not. but I've been having positive dreams all week and know I'll be ok <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i play in a band and recently we had a concert and played to the most appreciative audience ever <endOfText>
<human> thats amazing. where was the concert? and how many people were participated? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i kept my friend's wallet which he'd forgotten at m y place and i felt trustful <endOfText>
<human> did he came back to take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm always scared that something bad will happen in my life. <endOfText>
<human> I think a lot of people feel the same, it's natural. Is there anything in particular that you're scared of happening?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am always scared that i can't control a lot of things that happens in my life <endOfText>
<human> There is a lot you can't control in life though. If you focus on the things you can control, then it might stop the negative feelings about things you can't control <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think a lot of people feel the same, it's natural. Is there anything in particular that you're scared of happening? <endOfText>
<human> i am always scared that i can't control a lot of things that happens in my life  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow, my son has completely let me down today <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry about that. What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought my wife had umbilical hernia. Which is a serious health condition. Doctor told her she might die or end up in an ER! <endOfText>
<human> well I mean...does she really? or do you just think she does <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was offered the job of my dreams, I knew I had everything I could ever need. I finally felt content in my life. <endOfText>
<human> that's great, what kind of job was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have always homeschooled my kids. <endOfText>
<human> That's really interesting. Do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's really interesting. Do you think it benefits them learning from you rather than qualified teachers? <endOfText>
<human> Well, we put them into the local public schools this year and even though its so scary for me, they are loving it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> as a writer i prefer to always be alone <endOfText>
<human> I see, being alone can be fulfilling to. It all depends on the kind of person you are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember I remember when I had my little Labrador puppy. But I had to give her away. <endOfText>
<human> why? i had the same thing happening to me with my dog. is she somewhere safe though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "Am very happy to have the best family in the world". <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing, It's always nice to get on with your family! Have you always got on with them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, we understand ourselves and know our boundaries. we are always happy <endOfText>
<human> that's so nice to hear. I have always been very close with my family too, but I have friends who aren't and it's horrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's amazing, It's always nice to get on with your family! Have you always got on with them? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, we understand ourselves and know our boundaries. we are always happy  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a girl pregnant without marrying her, I feel so terrible because I am a very religious person <endOfText>
<human> Well, if you provided for your child's care then you shouldn't feel bad. I mean, this isn't the dark ages. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved going trick or treating with my daughter. It used to get me so eager and excited every year. <endOfText>
<human> That's so good. How old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt comfortable and at ease with a new friend, she took the time to help me learn and be comfortable doing something new. <endOfText>
<human> that's really nice - it's always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around. What was the new thing your friend made you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that's really nice - it's always amazing to have friends who you feel comfortable around. What was the new thing your friend made you do? <endOfText>
<human> She had me go rock climbing with her at her gym. It was so scary at first! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when people tell me what to do <endOfText>
<human> Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do, or just figures of authority?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you hate when anybody tells you what to do, or just figures of authority? <endOfText>
<human> i don't think anyone should have the power or the right to tell you what's good for you if you didn't ask for help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unlike many of my friends I was confident when I went to job interviews and I always got the job. I guess I was lucky. <endOfText>
<human> I think if you're confident in yourself, you can talk yourself into most jobs. You should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think if you're confident in yourself, you can talk yourself into most jobs. You should give yourself more credit and not say you were lucky! <endOfText>
<human> I guess you're right and I appreciate the way you look at this. I did have the right qualifications, so maybe that boosted my confidence. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been eating pizza almost every day lately and I'm satisfied with it. I have no shame. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so jealous, I would eat pizza every day if I could! What's your favourite pizza?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so jealous, I would eat pizza every day if I could! What's your favourite pizza? <endOfText>
<human> I like any kind honestly. But Hawaiian wins my heart! Pepperoni is good too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> when i left my family's house to study in another city i got upset. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. What are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am loyal to my wife and i'll always be. <endOfText>
<human> That's an amazing attitude. Not many people are like that nowadays. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone slapped me, I got so mad <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, was in unprovoked?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, was in unprovoked? <endOfText>
<human> I didn't step on her intentionally, that was a temper issue <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is starting his senior year.  I am finding myself feeling so emotional about it. <endOfText>
<human> You must be having bitter ,sweet emotion.I remember my mom was also emotional when i left boarding school for the first time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a fight with my mother and i said a lot of horrible things, i regret doing that. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Did you apologize? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was in a yoga class last week when something happened... <endOfText>
<human> what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife have been with me through thick and thin for 30 years <endOfText>
<human> That is extremely loyal! You must have a really happy relationship?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes we have 4 lovely girls, they are all graduates of Ivy league universities. 2 are married <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like you really have had a good life so far! It makes me feel happy hearing good news stories like this  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is extremely loyal! You must have a really happy relationship? <endOfText>
<human> Yes we have 4 lovely girls, they are all graduates of Ivy league universities. 2 are married  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied very hard before exams. I tried to make sure I was always prepared. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice of you. Hardwork pays <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the public toilet and went out with a toilet paper sticking out of my pants... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's awkward. Are you able to laugh about it now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been married for 30 years. I love my husband but I kind of miss the fun of flirting and dating someone new. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, maybe that's a sign to bring fun and adventure in your relationship? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Probably so! I am very loyal and I would never cheat on him! He's a good guy. <endOfText>
<human> That's good, there is a lot of ways to make the relationship alive and interesting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I missed my good friend's birthday party last month because I was too busy and forgot. <endOfText>
<human> That's such a shame! Were you honest with your friend, and did they forgive you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's such a shame! Were you honest with your friend, and did they forgive you? <endOfText>
<human> I was honest, they were still upset which makes me feel bad. I tried to make it up to her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If she is that good a friend, I'm sure she'll forgive you soon enough. <endOfText>
<human> I hope that she does, it made me feel awful. But here's to good thinking and positive vibes, she will come around! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat died last week, and i can't get over it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so sorry. Losing a pet is never an easy thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went skydiving a few years ago. It was a rush! <endOfText>
<human> skydiving is insane to me, how did it go? what reminded you of it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Earlier this year I was going through a very hard time with the illness of a family member. Out of the blue, my dog died. <endOfText>
<human> That's incredibly sad, I'm so sorry for your loss. How long had you had your dog?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had him about 7 years. I loved him so much and having him die when he did was more than I could take at that moment. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have close friends and family that can help to support you through this time?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's incredibly sad, I'm so sorry for your loss. How long had you had your dog? <endOfText>
<human> I had him about 7 years. I loved him so much and having him die when he did was more than I could take at that moment.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have close friends and family that can help to support you through this time? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, everyone was great and I am feeling much better now. We did get a new puppy, but I still miss my old dog! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was shattered by the news today, seeing all those innocent die made me very sad <endOfText>
<human> Oh, No! What caused so many innocent deaths? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cooked a big turkey and served it to my in-laws. I embarrassed myself because it was terrible in the end. <endOfText>
<human> did they anything mean to you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> did they anything mean to you? <endOfText>
<human> No. But I used sugar instead of salt. It wasn't good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had a slight financial struggle recently. I  don't see a way out of it. <endOfText>
<human> How did you get into this situation?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has gone a little crazy with spending frivolously. <endOfText>
<human> well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I've hadhad an epiphany. After not being serious about religion ever, I may have to turn it over to God... <endOfText>
<human> Well I have never heard of God helping with financial situations but perhaps if you pray and scrape together enough money for a ticket to Las Vegas all your troubles will be gone <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lol... I went to a Christian school. Never cared before  but now I'm 47. Maybe He can just give me a quick loan??? <endOfText>
<human> This is a lot to ask for. I recommend going straight to the pope for something of this magnitude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How did you get into this situation? <endOfText>
<human> My girlfriend has gone a little crazy with spending frivolously.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts <endOfText>
<human> I think I've hadhad an epiphany. After not being serious about religion ever, I may have to turn it over to God...  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sent a parcel to my cousin recently and it never arrived. It cost me $50 <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! Some delivery driver must be excited about their latest acquisition! <endOfText>
<human> I did think that it had probably been stolen but I try to see the best in people so I hoped it had just been delayed. That was 2 months ago and it still has not arrived. Maybe it is time to move on <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I hope they can trace it for you. Better late than never. I wish you good luck with that! <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for your kind words and wishes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am satisfied with my current life. <endOfText>
<human> I'm really glad to hear that! That's one of the best feelings I think! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A tornado hit our home and destroyed it, as well as our car. <endOfText>
<human> oh god, that sounds horrifying, are you and your family okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "A 10.2 magnitude volcanic eruption shattered my neoghborhood.I lost a fortune!" <endOfText>
<human> Oh, my goodness! Are you and your family safe though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY wife racked up a lot of debt on our credit cards which put us in a lot of debt. I am furious with her. <endOfText>
<human> Well,shes your wife after all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a 10k race on the weekend <endOfText>
<human> Oh amazing! How long were you training for, and how many people did you beat?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh amazing! How long were you training for, and how many people did you beat? <endOfText>
<human> I trained for 2 months and beat 300 people to get the gold. It was a very humid day so everyone struggled but I can only run in my lunch break when it is hottest so I was used to it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The dog I grew up with died a few years ago. I was really sad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Aaawww,  I'm sorry you had to go through that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm 47 years old and have been taking psychotropic meds for well over 30 years. I'm having more and more trouble with them working properly. It's happening a lot now. I'm at my wits end <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry you are going through that. Have you tried to go back to your doctor and discuss making some changes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yesterday i ran into an old friend and i was so surprised he changed a lot. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been so nice for both of you. Had he changed for the better? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really disappointed when the bank told us our loan wasn;t approved. Now I can't buy our dream house. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's so sad, i'm really sorry about that. Is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that's so sad, i'm really sorry about that. Is it possible to apply for a loan again in the future for the same house? <endOfText>
<human> Not with the same bank. That house will be long gone by then anyway, unfortunately. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yesterday at work some guy ran his work truck into our building <endOfText>
<human> oh no, what a nightmare! Was anyone injured?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh no, what a nightmare! Was anyone injured? <endOfText>
<human> no thankfully it was just the cover out front but it destroted it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust so easily, I love dating guys that don't go after women <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, a good relationship is based on trust  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's cool, a good relationship is based on trust <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, being trustworthy can make both of you go a long way <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor recently had a baby! I brought her and her family a ton of food. <endOfText>
<human> I like food.  What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I never miss making coffee in the morning and delivering it to my wife in bed. <endOfText>
<human> Aw that is very kind of you. I love morning coffee! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter called and said she had bad news for me which made me apprehensive. She apparently scratched the car. <endOfText>
<human> oh no. How bad was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can see how it would make you anxious. <endOfText>
<human> Nothing happened to her, which is what counts. She was lucky. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel alone most of the time and I kinda enjoy it <endOfText>
<human> Is it because you are surrounded by people most of the time? I get that way sometimes too, so I can relate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really love being scared, but I'm also a chicken. My friends convinced me to go to a haunted house! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like so much fun! Were you scared? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kitten caught a cockroach in my kitchen last night. She then proceeded to try and eat it in front of me which was disgusting. <endOfText>
<human> Yuck! At least the cockroach isn't in your kitchen anymore! My cats like to catch mice and bring them to the front door. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work at a milk plant and today my coworker left early on me. He's always leaving me with tons of work to do! <endOfText>
<human> Oh I bet that is frustrating!  Can you report it to someone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to buy a vacuum and finally found it on sale. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of vacuum is it? I bought a Dyson recently and I love it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pregnant with my son and my husband would bring me chocolate shakes home every night. I would get so excited for him to be home with it! <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet Literately. He seems like a nice guy  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's so sweet Literately. He seems like a nice guy <endOfText>
<human> He's the best! I had such a craving for chocolate. Plus it didn't hurt that we lived right down the street from Dairy Queen! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am depressed most of the time. Im going to therapy and taking meds. I feel like im broken <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm sorry that you are going through that. Have you discussed changing your medication up with your doctor? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my stepmother for the first time in 15 years since my daddy passed away. It was totally unplanned and It was quite a shock to see her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, It must have been quite an overwhelming experience for both of you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Most definitely. It brought a lot of pain to the surface that I thought I had gotten past. I seem to be dwelling a bit now. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats because I know you will definitely overcome the pains <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  provide for a family of 8. It's tiring but rewarding <endOfText>
<human> Wow! The struggle is real. I hope you're not too tired and stressed. I wish you luck for being so selfless!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got lucky :) <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! You won the kiddo lottery! I wish you all the best of health and happiness!!!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! The struggle is real. I hope you're not too tired and stressed. I wish you luck for being so selfless! <endOfText>
<human> I love my wife alot, we had a set of twin 3 times in a row so the children are 6 plus myself and her all 8 <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do twins run in your family or are you just lucky? I mean that seriously, not sarcastically <endOfText>
<human> I got lucky :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello. I just wanted to say my dog died today and it's been absolutely devastating for me. He was my best friend. <endOfText>
<human> that's sad I hate to hear that how long did you have him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got promoted! It's been a rough 5 years but I got it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Congratulations on getting promoted, that is awesome!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted to make my husband feel better since he was sick for a few weeks. I made him soup, rubbed his back, and ran him hot baths. <endOfText>
<human> You are the best wife ever! I can't believe how lucky he is! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What did he get sick with? I hope it's not contagious! <endOfText>
<human> He had the flu unfortunately. I'm so glad I didn't end up getting him, but just thankful he is better now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was to check my name on the list of students that passed, I got so tensed <endOfText>
<human> oh yeah, did you end up passing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone tried to break into my house last year. I was pretty scared. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrifying!  Did they catch the guy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I defended my thesis last year, with a raging ear infection. <endOfText>
<human> You must have been in so much pain. How did you manage to endure it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Starting yoga recently has left me feeling a ton better about my body and the way I can move! <endOfText>
<human> I really want to try Yoga! Would you say your back feels better? This sounds so fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I recently got a new puppy! We haven't had a puppy in such a long time. <endOfText>
<human> oh that's awesome what kind of puppy did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So it's been raining a lot lately after being relatively dry. I wanted it at first but now its destroying my garden. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome rain is good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a little bit uncomfortable with knowing that my Ex has HIV <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness thats terrible. How did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to close my zip after using the washroom and I walked into the boardroom unknowingly <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, the dreaded fly being down for the big meeting. How'd it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so pity for the children I saw begging for food yesterday <endOfText>
<human> That's truly heartbreaking. Were you able to help them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's truly heartbreaking. Were you able to help them? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes, I gave them some money, though I had little, really wished I had much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on my way home last night. I saw a lady on the side of the road hitchhiking. I wanted to pick her up.. <endOfText>
<human> So what happened then <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid recited the periodic table of elements to me. It was amazing. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How old is your child? That's very impressive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents always teach my toddler son the worst grammar. It is infuriating. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. Maybe you can have a chat with them about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have tried so many times. They just continue to do it. <endOfText>
<human> That must be so infuriating. I'd get upset if it were me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won off a scratch off ticket! I have the absolute worst luck with these things too! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm such a dummy, I left a door open in my car overnight and now the battery is dead. <endOfText>
<human> This happened to me! Don't feel bad, it happens to people such as us! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was getting excited about my upcoming birthday, I didn't know if my husband had planned a secret party! <endOfText>
<human> Has he given you any hints that he might be planning a party? That would be so much fun to be with all your family and friends in one place to celebrate you!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother was diagnosed with stage four cancer. I feel helpless. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I am so sorry to hear that. That is awful and makes me sad. Have you talked to anyone about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you for the kind words. It gives me hope for the future. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad, I hope you have a great day today! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I have been together for 7 years. Last night she went out with her friends but I know she would never cheat on me. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's so cool of you. You really trust her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Absolutely, she's always been good to me and has never given me reason to not trust her. <endOfText>
<human> I really admire your love life.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost a loved one last week, I felt like I was loosing my breath <endOfText>
<human> Are you ok? That's absolutely devastating. I hope you have people to confide in right now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't eat carbs but I am still fat :( how come i am the only one that have to pass through this ? <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. While diet is most of it, exercise can play a role too. How active is your lifestyle? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a home loan and I'm waiting to hear back on it. The waiting is driving me up a wall. <endOfText>
<human> can't you place a call to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, policy recently changed at work, not due to anything I did, and they are now paying me extra money! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! Congratulations. What was the policy that changed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked a friend I'd had for a very long time to be in my wedding. She agreed and then completely disappeared from my life. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that's rough.  Did you ever find out why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked hard at winning a competition and ended up losing to my coworker, it made me pretty upset. <endOfText>
<human> How close did you lose by? I bet at the next competition, you'll wipe the floor with them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father passed away over the winter and we are huge baseball fans. This is the first season not watching games with him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness that is so sad, I am sorry to hear about your father. Are you handling him being gone okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sneezed on my coworker by accident yesterday! She was horrified and doesn't talk to me anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is really embarrassing. Hopefully she can move on from it and you can laugh about it one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There are a couple barn cats that live on my property. One likes to bring dead mice to my front door! <endOfText>
<human> I think it's so weird that cats do that. It's like they are bringing us trophies or something! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very certain about my girl's love for me <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet. It's good to have that kind of faith in your relationships. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my cat and can't find her. She just disappeared one day and I don't know where she is. <endOfText>
<human> have you called any rescue center yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> after quitting school for two years I am finally going back <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, good for you. That education will help you the rest of your life!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, good for you. That education will help you the rest of your life! <endOfText>
<human> yeah I hope so it's exciting and scary at the same time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my boyfriend speaking to his ex girlfriend at the store. The way she looked at him made me so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I would have been really frustrated. Does she know he is dating you now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the car dealer to buy a new vehicle several years ago. I always get so nervous when I have to talk to the dealers. <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand the anxiety. You never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal. Did you get a new car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having difficulties when I think about my father. He died one year ago and it's still hurting very much. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear about that, it must be awful. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sorry to hear about that, it must be awful. Do you have friends and family that you can talk to about this? <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for your kindness. My brother is around to listen but he lives a very busy life so it's hard to find someone to turn to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a friend that was always there for me, he took me as a sister, I missed him <endOfText>
<human> Aw, he sounded like such a great friend!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw, he sounded like such a great friend! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, but he died last month <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I met my girlfriend she had a 5 year old son. We have been together for years now and I consider him as my own child. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sweet.  I really commend people who treat kids like their own, it's so important for a kid to grow up feeling like they have a lot of people in their corner.  I have a stepdaughter myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 5 year old stated Kindergarten last week. She was really nervous and a bit scared so when I went to leave her she cried and clung to me. Her teacher pulled her away but she had ahold of my shirt and ended up pulling it down and exposing my bra and chest. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no now that's a sticky situation! How'd you manage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just totaled my car recently. I had it for well over a decade, it was like a part of me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I am sorry! I have been there, it sucks! Are you okay though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I needed to get a loan from the bank the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really?  What was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so ashamed when I farted in a mall <endOfText>
<human> Thats aweful! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has been so supportive,we dont keep secrets <endOfText>
<human> That is great, that is the beginning of happiness <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got so embarrassed  when I farted in a mall,  my crush was just beside me <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did they react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They all looked at me surprisingly <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? I would just laugh it off. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter kept talking to me while I was trying to work. I didn't get much done at all. <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame, I'm sorry. Does she have anything to keep her occupied while you work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just got a new puppy! Our old dog passed away recently but this new one is such a pleasure to be around. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear about your dog passing away. But, I'm happy you have a new friend in the new one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i don't like it when my girlfriend goes out without me, I feel insecure and feel like something bad will happen to her <endOfText>
<human> I hear you! Is she going out with her girlfriends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i farted in a board meeting <endOfText>
<human> How mortifying! Did anyone hear it? Did it smell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just turned 11 and for her birthday we are taking her to Universal Studios for the first time. She is finally tall enough to ride all the rides. <endOfText>
<human> happy riding to your daughter <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have this boyfriend,  he's so nice,  I promised not to cheat on him <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, I hope he returns the favor as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had a rough summer taking care of my kids, they've been so active. But school's starting back up and I'm ready to kick back. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah,  I've been there,  I really understand  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah,  I've been there,  I really understand <endOfText>
<human> Thank you for your understanding. They're in a camp right now before they go back to school, so I've certainly been relaxing as of late. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just sent me a box with bath bombs and a spa kit! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds wonderful!  Do you get to use them yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, I am embarrassed to say, but my daughter got in a ton of trouble the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Kids do that sometimes. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got all it takes to pass my exams tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds good!  I'm sure you studied lots? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm leaving on vacation next week. We will be in Florida. I have packed at least 3 bags.. <endOfText>
<human> hey that's not too bad how long are you going for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had the chance to cheat on my girlfriend the other day and I didn't <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how did that almost happen? I would rethink my options. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hired someone to clean my house last week! <endOfText>
<human> Did they do a good job of cleaning your house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That would make me nervous, you never know if they are looking through your things. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah but they had really good reviews and were reccomended to me by my neighbor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite cake stand that my aunt gave me was stolen. <endOfText>
<human> That's a shame. Do you know who stole it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out recently that my school processed my financial aid paperwork improperly. So I won't be able to attend school this semester. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That happened to my sister last year. We were able to work out a plan, but she had to get a loan temporarily. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got that raise I asked for. I worked so hard to get it. <endOfText>
<human> Ok ,how much raise did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Theres this particular staff of mine that i can rely on,others have disappointed me" <endOfText>
<human> Too bad you've been let down so often. I'm glad your new worker is satisfactory. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss my old neighborhood. I had such fun there as a child. <endOfText>
<human> Do you still live nearby? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried a new grocery shopping service called Shipt last week. <endOfText>
<human> Did you like it? What did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i got cheated and broken up with last night I can't believe it. I'm so angry. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry, you must feel terrible. It's their loss in the long run. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I saw a kid at the park fall off his bike. He looked like he was in a lot of pain. <endOfText>
<human> oh man that's not good at all! Did he break anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is my best friend. I am so glad I get to share life with him. <endOfText>
<human> It's awesome to have a partner like that. That's certainly why they call it "the other half." <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, makes day to day life more enjoyable. <endOfText>
<human> I second that. Finding that eternal partner is one of the greatest joys a human being can experience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family put me in charge of the thanksgiving turkey. Everything was going right and I was so pleased as punch to be in chage. <endOfText>
<human> How did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello! We just moved to a new area of town. <endOfText>
<human> Cool! Where did you move too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i miss when i was in grade school, i didn't have to pay bills and worry about politics. The good old days <endOfText>
<human> i understand, life can do that to you, and looking back always bring fond memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried shopping at a new discount grocery last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! Did you find any good deals? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just recently registered for a flag football team, i just hope I am good and don't embarass myself <endOfText>
<human> Flag football is so much fun! What position would you like to play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother passed away recently. It's been really rough getting by without her, but she left our family her greatest quality, strength. <endOfText>
<human> that's really good... I am very sorry for your loss. It sounds cliche but it gets better with time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend promised to take care of my pets while I was on vacation. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of them, what kind of pets? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My child was sick last week. I had to stay home with them. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, sorry to hear that. There is something going around these days. I hope they are better now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> university is starting soon and i never felt more ready in my life <endOfText>
<human> i know me too! Why are you ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i bought all my school supplies for this semester already. I think I am good to go <endOfText>
<human> you are prepared more than ever ! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever tried to steam clean an antique rug? <endOfText>
<human> I have not, I feel like it should be done by a professional.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have not, I feel like it should be done by a professional. <endOfText>
<human> Well I figured that out. I cleaned mine last night. They are clean but now they smell horrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe the dirt adds to the whole antique feel of them. <endOfText>
<human> LOL, yeah! so true. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went down South with a really good group of friends about a month ago and it was the best time. <endOfText>
<human> That must've been fun! What did you guys do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went boating and fishing. I had such a good time that when we got back I sent them a photo and wrote a note telling each of them how much I appreciated their friendship. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds like so much fun! sounds like you are very grateful for good friends!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day i was in my car with the windows down singing. I didn't know anyone else was around. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a really lovely way to go somewhere in a car! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i've been working on my game for months now, and i believe in my abilities and i believe that this game will do amazing! <endOfText>
<human> What game do you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend flying in from the other side of the country next week. <endOfText>
<human> wow, is it the first time you're gonna see him? is he going to stay at your place? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sounds like you planned for everything! enjoy yourself! <endOfText>
<human> I am excited!  I sure hope it will be fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Next week I'm leaving the company I've worked for for 3 years and taking a totally new position at a new company. I'm nervous! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, never settle for less. Always strive for more! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes this is definitely an upgrade! I'm just going to be the "new" person and I really do like my current co-workers. <endOfText>
<human> Well hopefully you can still maintain communication with them. It's normal to be nervous though, just go in confident <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in the market for a steam cleaner and did tons of research til I chose the best one. <endOfText>
<human> That's the best way to do it. Read before you buy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever been overcharged for something you weree told was only one set price? <endOfText>
<human> yes, my internet provider is notorious for that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband got a nice raise at work! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been a good thing did y'all celebrate. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever let some one borrow you car? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, my cousin actually borrowed my car to take his driving test <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was taken by surprise this morning when I went out back on my lanai. <endOfText>
<human> Omg, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever had a family member everyone else doubted all the time. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes I'm worried that I'm that family member, but I'm not sure what to do to make them have confidence in me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my dog Buddy died, I was horribly upset. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry that happened . I have 3 dogs myself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my little cousin to the community pool the other day and it reminded me of when I was in his shoes. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, yes I remember those days too so clearly. Such carefree day, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> went to the bathroom and saw something you don't see everyday. <endOfText>
<human> What did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I enjoy reminiscing on the better times in life. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. About friends an d family. Things I got to see and do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was caught cheating on a math test... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How did that end? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my co-workers got to be a close friend of mine. Then she decided that I was advancing faster than her and sabotaged my job. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so selfish. Did you try and get back at her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tend to let my better half make all the important decisions in our life. <endOfText>
<human> Is it because you trust their judgement or is there a different reason? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to pay the electric bill last week so a lady came a turned the power off. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate that! So what did you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog really seemed out of it and depressed the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Poor dog! Did you find out why? Is it better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the worst nightmare last night. I woke up screaming and shaking. <endOfText>
<human> Oh! What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was gardening last weekend and have to move pots that have been sitting outside for years. I knew there were spiders! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate spiders! Were you able to avoid them and move your pots? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend and I haven't been friends for super long, but I believe we will be in each other's lives forever. She's such a great person. <endOfText>
<human> I have a friend like that. We lose touch but we will always be great friends. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to visit my mm last weekend. We enjoyed talking and looking through old photos. <endOfText>
<human> Do you guys live far away from each other? I love talking with my mom about her and my childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once, I bought this really pretty dress to go on a date. Then the worst thing happened! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  Did he stand you up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is going to accept a new job.  He's going to be out of state for two months. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like good news and bad. I hope you will be going with him someday. :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was cloudy outside earlier today but the weather is fickle so I can't count on there being rain. <endOfText>
<human> Rain is relaxing to myself, odd  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Rain is relaxing to myself, odd <endOfText>
<human> Yea I like the rain too especially during the summer. I meant that my local weather often seems likely to rain without actually doing so. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey there, I have feelings for this girl <endOfText>
<human> That's a wonderful situation to be in. Are you planning to tell her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going to go see a new movie that came out last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really what movie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend I'm going on a road trip to visit friends who live 8 hours away. <endOfText>
<human> I love road trips, sounds like a good time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night I just felt like a couch potato and watched some movies. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds relaxing! What did you watch <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My puppy just passed away <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry. What kind of dog was he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a teacher.  School starts back for me in two weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, I guess you'll have your hands full. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke up with my abusive boyfriend of five years. <endOfText>
<human> Thats good. Abusive relationships are the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of cats decided to poop on the tv remote last night, even though I had just changed their litter box. I love him, but that really grossed me out. <endOfText>
<human> Yuck. Did you throw the remote out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, my boyfriend cam over to help with some yard work. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get all of it done? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ordered a sandwich from KFC the other day and i told them no pickles. Yet as soon as I bite there are pickles. <endOfText>
<human> Mistakes are made, but still. I can how that would be annoying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got my associate's degree last year.  I had to get an A on my last final exam to get an A in my last class. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that must have been pretty challenging. Where you able to do it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I took a two week vacation last year, and a friend of mine watched the house for us while we were away. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome!  Did everything go well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey i went ot the pound today. <endOfText>
<human> Did you adopt an animal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt was rushed to the hospital a few days ago. They are currently monitoring her condition. <endOfText>
<human> i am sorry to hear that, i know she will be better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, when I was riding my bike home from work, I was struck by a van on my right side. My right lung fully collapsed and my left partially collapsed. It was a scary situation. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it was, I'm glad you are doing better now.  Did they find the person driving the van? Did they even stop? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, thats awesome you were only in for a few days.  I guess I haven't had an accident that bad before but I would have thought it would have been a longer time period. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I was pretty lucky. I had a chest tube put in, and once my lungs were inflating normally again, I didn't really need any more treatment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was the first day of school for my kids.  It was also the first day of pre-k for my 4 year old.  He was supposed to ride the bus home, but when the bus got here, he wasn't on it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!! Haha. The first days of school can be so hectic! But soon the routine will set in again and all will be good. :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I saw a spider run right across my desk.  I screamed so loud. <endOfText>
<human> I would of did the same. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What the hurricane did the Caribbean last year made me sad. <endOfText>
<human> It was a very devastating storm. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend my son came third in his jiu-jitsu competition <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! You must be so proud of him. What an accomplishment! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother called me to tell me he just bought a brand new car. <endOfText>
<human> oh wow that is cool, i don't think ill ever purchase a new car. a good used one will be my best option!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> oh wow that is cool, i don't think ill ever purchase a new car. a good used one will be my best option! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, me too. He got an infinity! It's so nice I wish I could have one of those! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> last year i had put a nice chunk of change into crypto-currencies like bitcoin... although they went up in value a great deal, they have came back down before i actually took any profits. feels bad! <endOfText>
<human> I watched that happen. Been thinking about doing some research on trading with bitcoin. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up one night and realized that a roach crawled on my arm. I jumped up screaming before I killed it. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! I'd have jumped too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son placed third in his jiu-jitsu competition. He surprised me with how well he did <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome. It's important for kids to know self defense and also to be active so all boxes are checked. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to write and play music. I've been practicing a new song and I know I'm ready to play it on stage in front of people <endOfText>
<human> that sounds great you must be jazzed up about it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a cat get hit by a car this morning <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is terrible! Did you try to save the cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, unfortunately, because I was on my way to class and I was already driving so fast. I feel so bad for it. <endOfText>
<human> Ahhh, what a horrible thing to see in the morning! Hope your day went well after that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ahhh, what a horrible thing to see in the morning! Hope your day went well after that. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks. It kind of started my day off on a bad note, but I'll get over it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my wife and I went to New Zealand last year, we went swimming at a hot water beach. It was a really fun, interesting experience. <endOfText>
<human> I've never heard of a hot water beach.  What's it caused by? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She acted as though I am a magician and can do 12 things at once <endOfText>
<human> Who are we talking about? I'm sorry you're upset. Maybe you could talk to her and let her know you need help. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss sorry im venting <endOfText>
<human> It's okay. We all need to vent sometimes. Bosses are the worst people to deal with sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I went through Hurricane Irma last year. It was pretty scary. <endOfText>
<human>  i must have been terrifying, I am glad you both made it through it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i must have been terrifying, I am glad you both made it through it <endOfText>
<human> Me too! We got all the supplies we needed and put up the shutters ahead of time and sat it out. I'm glad we didn't need to use any of the supplies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The neighbor's dogs next door won't stop barking and let me sleep! <endOfText>
<human> That is awful!  I can deal with dogs barking during the day but at night is no good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The last time my mom was in town, she brought some photo albums from my childhood and we spent a while paging through them. <endOfText>
<human> That must've been nice. I bet that reminded you a lot of when you were a kid. Did you enjoy your time with your mom? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little brother is in high school, and he had a music performance at school last week. He's a guitar player, and when I saw him up there, I was so surprised by how good he's gotten! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awsome hopefully he sticks with it. Its a chick magbnet <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I think my cat is just plain rude! <endOfText>
<human> Haha, yeah cats can be rude! I prefer dogs myself. They are much sweeter. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old stuffed animal in my closet yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a koala? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was raining pretty hard the other day, and I normally walk to and from work, but my wife vey kindly decided to pick me up and give me a ride home that day. <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like a keeper <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter had an end of the year play at school and I was one happy dad <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Did she have a good time doing the play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been pet sitting for my mom while she's on vacation, and I've been alone in her house for a couple weeks now. It's tough being her by myself. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, you must be lonely. At least you have her pet with you, right? What pet does she have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A car nearly hit me yesterday just because they wanted to change lanes while turning <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that is terrifying. I'm glad you didn't get hit. What kind of crazy person tries to turn and change lanes at the same time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My primary care doc moved to a new office.  She's about half an hour further away from me, but I decided to stay with her anyway. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is definitely difficult to change doctors. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm feeling pretty lucky this month. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, did something in particular make you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom told me the other day that they found out my grandma has Dementia, and is degrading pretty fast. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I'm sorry. That's a tough one to go through. Mine had the same. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey! Yesterday, I signed for the gym near my house and an introductory personal training class with one of the trainers. Before leaving, I felt unsure if this was a good choice and what I should do. <endOfText>
<human> you will regret not going I think you should go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah! I ended up going yesterday and it was a great time. I can't wait to go later today! <endOfText>
<human> see you made the right choice and you will always be glad you went <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad is throwing a big party at his house. He want me to fly up to go to the party. <endOfText>
<human> cool! are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out I get my birthday off from work and still get paid! <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Is that a perk of your job or did you have to use a vacation day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You should watch this movie, I just watched it and it was really good, but also a bit emotional. . <endOfText>
<human> What's the movie? I love watching new stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was Christopher Robin! When I watched it, it was really heartfelt and wholesome. It made me thankful and grateful for everything in my life. <endOfText>
<human> I'd love to see that. I was a big fan of Winnie the Pooh growing up, so I bet I'll love it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my coworker's has been over 30 minutes late everyday for almost a month now. It's driving me crazy, and giving me so much more work to do. <endOfText>
<human> Aw dang, that must really be pain for you. Have you talked with anyone else about this? I'm sure other people are having problems with this coworker also . <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate it when you order food and you wait with anticipation. your food arrives and it's not what you ordered? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes! I really hate that. It has happened to me more than I like. Did you get a refund at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt bad I missed my grandfathers funeral a while ago <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that is so sad. I am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no, that is so sad. I am sure it would of meant a lot for you to be there. <endOfText>
<human> I just didnt want to remember him like that you know <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received an excellent grade on an exam I studied really hard on <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That is always a great feeling! A reward after such hard work. :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been thinking about applying to this job that looks great, but I'm not sure if I'm qualified for it. <endOfText>
<human> It can't hurt to try, might as well give it a shot, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't make decisions when buying things if there is too many choices <endOfText>
<human> Do you run into this issue a lot?  I could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate it when you find hair in your food?! <endOfText>
<human> I do!  It grosses me out, even when it's my own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While I was walking to class yesterday, I tripped over some loose bricks and fell down. The ground was wet from rain, so I was filthy when I got up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking home from work, and I saw somebody put their used gum in a homeless man's cup! <endOfText>
<human> That's just disgusting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't sleep well last night, and then my son was being extra demanding of attention. I got upset with him, but realize he'd really done nothing wrong <endOfText>
<human> It happens to everyone, being tired makes people so irritable. Being a mom is tough as it is. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just felt so bad for getting upset with him. <endOfText>
<human> Just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him, and I'm sure all will be forgiven! :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a business meeting on Friday this week, and it's with a big client for my company, so I really need to make a good impression. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you've had to do a lot of prep work.  Do you feel ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't raised in religious household but when I was a teenager I found god. <endOfText>
<human> That's very inspiring. How has it changed your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have found that it is to trust and accept events in life. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I think everything in life happens for a reason and we can't change that. I'm glad you had your breakthrough! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week my son went to visit family for a few days on his own. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Did you not want to go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a wisdom tooth bothering me and I knew what I had to do but didn't want to. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have to get it pulled? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got tickets to see my favorite band at Red Rocks Amphitheater. Seeing a show there is on my bucket list <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, I haven't been to a concert in ages. Who is the band? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son went to stay with family for a  few days all by himself. <endOfText>
<human> How do you feel about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found old home videos of me as a child while cleaning out my living room cabinets <endOfText>
<human> Those must have brought back some great memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Having a child changed my life. I never imagined I could be so protective of something. <endOfText>
<human> I have heard the same thing from my friends who have kids!  They say it's like a force takes over as soon as the baby is born <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes you want to sheild them from everything bad and nurture them. <endOfText>
<human> That has to be a very powerful feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has been messaging another guy from work a lot recently. <endOfText>
<human> do you think they are up to something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our lawnmower is broken, and our neighbour offered to help us out by mowing our lawn. <endOfText>
<human> That's nice, pretty rare to have good neighbors these days it seems! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got his first ear infection last week. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. Is he better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've only been with my boyfriend for 2 years, but I can't think about anyone else but him. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's so sweet!  Do you see a future together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bunch of surgeries this year. I"ve never felt more relaxed then when I found out I was clear and they were over with. <endOfText>
<human> That had to be rough, and glad to hear you're better. Do you have any follow-up appointments to go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes I have to be monitored for the rest of my life. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least you have some relief for now.  I hope that it stays in remission. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been going to the gym a lot lately and have lost a good bit of weight and toned up. <endOfText>
<human> Hey, good for you! That takes dedication. I admire that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, good for you! That takes dedication. I admire that. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks!  I went shopping over the weekend and got some new clothes.  I'm finally feeling good about myself again! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter starts her first year of university in another city next week. I'll really miss her. <endOfText>
<human> That's really exciting for her!  But I'm sure being apart will be difficult for both of you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dishwasher leaked and it damaged the floors and kitchen cupboards. <endOfText>
<human> Man, that really stinks.  Did insurance pay to repair your floor and cupboards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My stepmother just died. I am very sad <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that.  Death is not an easy thing to cope with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No its not she was only in her 50s life is short <endOfText>
<human> It's a difficult way to realize you should live every day to the fullest potential. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going on a trip to New York City in December. <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! first time there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Whats it like? I have never been there. <endOfText>
<human> It's so much fun!  There is always something to do, even in the middle of the night, and the food is amazing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to watch Sailor Moon as a kid, and when they made a reboot, I got to share that with my daughters. <endOfText>
<human> Sailor Moon~!  That was the best show!  I've shared it with my kids, too.  And the laugh at the picture of me dressed up as Sailor Jupiter from loooooong ago! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking down our downtown club area one night a friend bumped into me and I tripped over a little fence. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, man. Did you end up falling? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah took a hard fall. right on to my knees. No way to catch myself at all. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch.  Did you get bruised up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My stepmother just died. I am very sad <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that she passed away.  Had she been sick a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No not at all. Her Aorta ruptured suddenly <endOfText>
<human> Wow.  I hope she wasn't in any pain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was ashamed once when I recieved a report card when I was young and I performed poorly. My parents trusted me to do well and I did not do well and slacked off.". <endOfText>
<human> I think most people have been there.  Its tough disappointing your parents and even worse when you know you could have done something about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was once given a watch and I got the opportunity to make a lot of money off it, but I kept it for it's emotional value.". <endOfText>
<human> How much money are we talking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did the final exams for my course last week, and I did so much studying and cramming, I'm sure I aced it. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully, your hard work payed off. Where the finals hard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in the second grade my parents planned a trip to Disney World. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, lucky! That is one of my favourite places on earth! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't stop thinking about it. I would have trouble sleeping at night waiting for it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you enjoy it once you got there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes it was worht the wait. They don't lie the place is magical. <endOfText>
<human> It really is. I've been to both disney world and dsiney land, I think I prefer disney land.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really is. I've been to both disney world and dsiney land, I think I prefer disney land. <endOfText>
<human> Why Disney Land is like one quarter the size? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my car into get serviced and it ended up costing twice what I had budgeted. I'm going to be short again this month. <endOfText>
<human> That's really bad, what are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure, I might have to ask my mom for a loan. <endOfText>
<human> Well at least you have a safety net.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well at least you have a safety net. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but I really don't want to. I might try to sell a few electronics.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's back to school time. I am a teacher and I spent time getting my classroom ready today. <endOfText>
<human> That's got to be exciting!  [And as a parent, I salute you!]  What grade do you teach? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I teach high school cooking! It's a lot of fun! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow!  That does sound fun!  Just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, we eat almost everything we make. It's a great practical class. <endOfText>
<human> What sorts of things do the kids learn how to make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We do everything from baking to pasta, starches, meat and poultry...we run a little mock restaurant for other teachers. <endOfText>
<human> I wish they had that when I was in school in 199*coughcough*  :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going camping tomorrow, it's one of my favourite things to do in the summer! <endOfText>
<human> That should be fun! Do you go every year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, we have a very small travel trailer so it's easy. <endOfText>
<human> very cool! That's awesome you have that opportunity to do something you love every summer! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate mowing the lawn. I wish I had a riding mower. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, lawn mowing sucks!  Do you have a large lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> not large but large enough that it's a pain. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe that riding mower would be a worthy investment? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a brand new mom, I had to run to the store for pumping supplies and my son would not.  stop.  screaming. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds miserable.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds miserable. <endOfText>
<human> I got so flustered, I just left the store and asked my mom to get the supplies for me. lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is finally able to come back to school after an academic suspension. <endOfText>
<human> That's good!  Was there a reason for the suspension? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a meeting one time talking about a serious subject. The most mortifying thing happened! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About 10 years ago my boss fired me out of nowhere. I was sick of making money for other people so I started my own business. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I'm sorry about getting fired, but it sounds like you've got guts! How do you like the business? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love set my own hours, do lots of different things, and make about the same I was making. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so great. So many people fantasize about doing that.  Congratulations! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a bunch of dresses online to try on for my brother's wedding. <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool! Have they arrived yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw the most terrifying movie a few weeks ago, called Hereditary. I was so scared! (Sorry hit send my accident) <endOfText>
<human> I love scary movies!  What was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's about a very disturbed family. You need to see it! It's fantastic. Toni Collette is in it. <endOfText>
<human> I love her!  I'm definitely going to see it, thanks for the rec! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She ran her mouth to everyone.  I was surprised <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I hate when people do that. It can ruin things. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah my nephew and I were playing the other day in the house, he got into these old porcelain pug figurines my mom used to have out and at first when I saw he had them I was apprenhensive about letting him fool around with them. I decided to just see what he would do, and he did end up ramming them together like cars, but they didnt break and we both ended up happy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didn't break.  Did you mom  know what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter won an award at her school for best artist. I was so happy for her. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds amazing! What kind of art does she want to produce? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She likes to work in oils but lately she's been doing sculture too. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Sculpture. Very impressed.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow. Sculpture. Very impressed. <endOfText>
<human> She's in grade 12, not sure if she'll persue it in university.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every year I get ready for hurricane season the day the season starts. <endOfText>
<human> Is it that time where you live? How do you prepare? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah it has been for about two months and will be until November. We stock gas and extra water and food. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. that must make you nervous. Where do you live? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know a secret that could destroy my best friends marriage, but I don't know what to do. <endOfText>
<human> What is the secret?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Her husband is fooling around. <endOfText>
<human> That's something she should know.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What is the secret? <endOfText>
<human> Her husband is fooling around.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's something she should know. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I'm just not sure how to break it to her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day i ordered a large group of books i've been wanting forever. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome, were they for school or for fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For fun. I'm very excited! <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome! Theyll come in handy on those rainy days or nice relaxing days! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is getting ready for his senior year in high school. I have mixed feelings about it! <endOfText>
<human> your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went to a friends getty the other week after a long opening to closing shift at work and had too many drinks and ended up peeing myself and blacking out! <endOfText>
<human> OMG that sounds awful!  Was your friend upset? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor just bought a new apple computer. <endOfText>
<human> He must have saved up quite a bit for that. They're pretty expensive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a gorgeous morning today, the sun was shining as I walked my dogs and I'm still on summer holdiays. <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  How many dogs do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today! Yikes! Not till September 4th up here. <endOfText>
<human> This is the earliest they've ever started here. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just got back from the trip of a lifetime, to Barcelona. She took her whole family, 4 kids. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds amazing! were you a little jealous? Did they have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! It's just hard realizing that I won't be taking any trips like that any time soon. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. We are only lucky enough to travel local. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago a lady at my job got a promotion i thought i was going to get. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nope. I think it was just favoritism to be honest. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, that happens.  Again, very sorry. Maybe you can find the silver lining in it. Or, find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough. <endOfText>
<human> It was really a tough one to swallow. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a research study for parents where you discuss and review an education website. It takes an hour of your time and you make $125. I applied and told my friedn about it so she could apply. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's a good deal- I wish I knew how to find that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was! Unfortunately for me she got chosen to participate and I did not. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, that's disappointing. Sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't stop thinking about my dog that died a year ago this week. <endOfText>
<human> Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. It's hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so hard! I honestly mourned for so long. Sorry about your cat. <endOfText>
<human> It will get easier. Hang in there! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks, I am thinking of getting a puppy. It might help. <endOfText>
<human> It does. I just got a new kitten a few weeks ago. It helps to have her to cuddle with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview later today. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. Is it for something that you're keen on pursuing a little longer term? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey. I dated with my ex girlfriend for more than a year and i was never with another girl, not even once <endOfText>
<human> That sounds sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate the way people drive. <endOfText>
<human> They usually use their smartphones while driving, which is very bad for everyobys safety <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's not just smart phones. They seem to love riding in blind spots or under taking. Very dangerous things to do. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, we as a community must teach people how to drive properly without any risks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had been unemployed for a long time until earlier this year. I originally wasn't sure if I was going to even interview for the position I did, but I'm glad I decided to. I got a call in late may from a merchandising company. I went back and forth in my mind after being rejected from many interviews over the past couple years. In the end I went for it, the interviewer liked what I had to say, and I was hired the same day! I've been working there ever since. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  That's awesome.  Sometimes it's scary to risk rejection, but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case.   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congratulations!  That's awesome.  Sometimes it's scary to risk rejection, but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I'm happy I kept at it :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm about to switch careers, so I'll be doing the interviewing thing soon. It's scary. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently added to a team of people to work on a new project at my job.  I'm not really sure the goal of the project is a good idea, so I've been reluctant to really jump into the project fully. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, how's it going? I was just thinking about my highschool days & I got really emotional. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, really? Was it a long time ago, or did you graduate recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I interviewed for a new job last week. I felt like it went great! Really excited to hear from them. <endOfText>
<human> That's so great! I hope you get the job - assuming it's one you really want. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids are driving me nuts! I can't wait for back to school time! <endOfText>
<human> Mine went back to school today!  I watched the bus drive off and I kinda looked around and said to myself, "Well shoot, what now?" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I'm jealous! Mine are just little and they have too much energy. <endOfText>
<human> Mine are older and think they're too cool for everything.  I took my usual 'first day of school' picture and I got, "Mom, aren't we too old for this?" <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day i was asked to bake a cake for a birthday party. I love baking cakes. <endOfText>
<human> That's so fun! I've always wanted to get into baking. How did the cake turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It turned out great! I knew I was going to be able to do it but made me so happy to see the outcome. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were so proud of your creation! I hope everyone enjoyed the cake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend recently moved to another state and I haven't seen her in a while <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. I bet you miss her a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a set of DVDs for the old 1970's Land of the Lost TV series. <endOfText>
<human> Wow!  Where did you find those?  I remember watching that series as a kid! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son got brought home by the police last week for spray painting an abandoned building. I was furious with him! <endOfText>
<human> You must've been really disappointed in him. Did you talk to him and find out why he did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tell my mother all of my secrets and I know she wouldn't tell anyone. <endOfText>
<human> You're lucky to have her! It's hard to find someone to trust.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Totally. I'm so grateful to have her. <endOfText>
<human> Moms. They are the best.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You're lucky to have her! It's hard to find someone to trust. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I know! I have friends that are great but my mom seems to be the one person I can count on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw, I'm sure you tell her. I hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. She's a great example. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aww, I'm sure that's been nothing but positive for you. <endOfText>
<human> Totally. I'm so grateful to have her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Years ago I had a friend who would tell me everything and told me she would always be there for me <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a great friend to have. Do you guys still keep in touch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been saving up some money for my trip to Universal in October! <endOfText>
<human> Sounds fun! How close are you to your target? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to write a essay for class. Luckily it was on a topic i love. <endOfText>
<human> Those are the most fun sorts of essays to write - and the easiest.  How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a wallet and returned it. <endOfText>
<human> That is very kind of you.  Im sure the owner was very appreciative! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone. I can't seem to break into the social circles at work. <endOfText>
<human> These things take time.  Have you met any of your neighbors? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I guess it does. I haven't- it's a big apartment building. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors.  Or look online for meetups for hobbies that you're interested in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to drive an hour longer to different school to take a math course I failed twice at my main university <endOfText>
<human> Ah. that sucks. Long commutes are miserable! hopefully you do better at the course this time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> do your neighborhood have lost dogs? mine does. i always find them roaming and keep them until i find their owners. <endOfText>
<human> Thats really nice of you.  Do you feed them too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes and i provide fresh water for the fur babies. <endOfText>
<human> Awww, have you adopted any that you brought in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had an interview for a promotion at my current job <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  How do you think it went? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like I blew out of the water! I was the main one answering questions compared to the other candidates. <endOfText>
<human> With that kind of confidence, you should be a shoe-in for the promotion! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me and my partner adopted and dog and took great care of it. <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's wonderful! What kind of dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hey do you like to plant flowers <endOfText>
<human> not really I kill everything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> are they carrot flowers? <endOfText>
<human> no, just roses and another kind. they eat everything <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family knows almost all of my secrets <endOfText>
<human> really, did you tell them your secrets? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty excited about this new Spider-Man game on PS4. <endOfText>
<human> i see you are a PS4 fan <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you ever walked and tripped? <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, many times. Not a whole lot of fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no, thats what happened to me today walking to my car. everyone seen me trip. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. I hope you didn't hurt yourself! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been saving up for my trip to Orlando in October! <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting!  Are you hitting up one of the amusement parks? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor was walking her dog the other day who she knows is aggressive towards other female dogs. She allowed her dog off leash to run up to my dog and they got in a fight. <endOfText>
<human> Were either of the dogs hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex girlfriend told me a secret I promised never to tell. I still have told no one <endOfText>
<human> really, what is the secret?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> really, what is the secret? <endOfText>
<human> She is a lizard person <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow, that is some secret. <endOfText>
<human> I kid. That would be one hell of a secret though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am currently waiting for my nephew to be born <endOfText>
<human> oh nice! first one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! i cant wait to spoil the lil guy. <endOfText>
<human> I bet. Do you have any children of your own? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend from high school and I pulled out our old year books the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Thats awesome! I was actually looking for mine the other day.  Were you looking up anyone in particular or just for fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am waiting for my sister to arrive into town. <endOfText>
<human> Ooh, sounds nice, Always good to see the siblings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just put in an application to adopt a police dog who failed his training. <endOfText>
<human> I didn't even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training, how did it fail do you know? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I was working and doing a little side Mturking. A Co-worker walked in and caught me on the website. I had to explain what it was and that I wasn't working at the moment... <endOfText>
<human> Uh-oh that's not good!  Did they understand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had a jiu jitsu competition a couple weeks ago. He placed third. <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Was he surprised, or hoping to do better/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There have been other times I felt like a poor parent and provider but that was one of the most memorably worst. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I finally graduated from technical school it was the greatest satisfaction. <endOfText>
<human> That must have felt very good. And taken a lot of determination. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dishwasher leaked and we had to have our whole kitchen and living redone due to the damages. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible!  Are you repairing it yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just finished third in a jiu-jitsu competition he was in. <endOfText>
<human> No way! Thats awesome!! How old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to look for another house but couldn't find anything for three months. I thought I was never going to find one. <endOfText>
<human> Did you finally manage to find a house you like? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so embarrassed at work last week.  My boss keeps bringing up a mistake I made months back. <endOfText>
<human> That happens, you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did though, I've apologized repeatedly.  we've discussed it multiple times.  It's hard because she brings it up in front of others. <endOfText>
<human> Oh well that seems improper, you should bring it up to her supervisor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No matter what other people say I always buy the newest Nintendo console. <endOfText>
<human> I hear that.  I can't afford all of them, but I have several.  Nintendo forever! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes in college I used to drink too much and made bad decisions which led to regret. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. You must feel apprehensive. You forgive yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About a month ago i found an old family photo album that i hadn't seen in a while <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice. Did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get my tag renewed last week as well as change my address. I had to get all the paperwork I needed together. <endOfText>
<human> That's so stressful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't sleep well last night, and then my son was being extra demanding of attention. I got upset with him, but realize he'd really done nothing wrong <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it can be hard to be patient, I can totally relate to that. Not sleeping well can make you really irritable sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a teacher and school starts back in two weeks. <endOfText>
<human> are you excited to get back to work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom has turrets and screams at people for no reason. <endOfText>
<human> That must be very challenging to deal with at times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for a couple more weeks and football season will start. <endOfText>
<human> You must be excited! Are you a huge fan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so the other week a barista at a coffee shop i frequent remembered my order before i even spoke. <endOfText>
<human> Well that must have been nice!  I assume you wanted it and not something different? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Two of my co-workers got into an argument in a meeting.  Loyalty is out the window now. <endOfText>
<human> i hate when coworkers fight, it is so uncomfortable and you don't want to take sides <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was looking through some old photos the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I love to look at photos <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love to go to the movies and spend time with my boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like a lot of fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Two co-workers got into a verbal sparring match during a meeting.  It was so shameful, ugh. <endOfText>
<human> That's not something that should be done in a meeting. If they're going to argue it should be done in private. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year a student I teach had a house fire. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  How terrible.  I hope no one was hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you have any teenage kids? <endOfText>
<human> No, im 20 years old. Dont plan on having kids for another couple years! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching my dad's friends dog and when I left him in his dog pen when I went to work, he had jumped out of it and made a mess of my living room! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodnes that must have been a lot of fun! How long did it take? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ok... So I am feeling great about the decisions I made. <endOfText>
<human> What did you decide on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to visit my parents yesterday and it seems like everytime i see my old photos from growing up that new memories flood my mind. <endOfText>
<human> Funny how that happens, isn't it? Any memories in particular stand out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so happy one of my students went above and beyond for class <endOfText>
<human> What class do you teach? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year has been the worst for rains and flooding. My house was recently affected and heavily damaged. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that do you have insurance to help you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so lucky to have my mom. She told me she wants to help me pay for college <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! You are fortunate to have a mom like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel horrible. I lost my temper and slapped my dog :( <endOfText>
<human> Thats not good, Did he do something to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So last weekend all my firends went out to a party but i was left out. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that. Did you ask them why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hasd such a sad day yesterday helping support my friend with a dying pet. It was so sads. <endOfText>
<human> Im sorry to hear that, how old was the pet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy i have good insurance to cover my car wreck <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear you had a wreck but thankful you had insurance <endOfText>

<human> What are your favourites options?  <endOfText>

<human> Why strange, its one of the happiest moments <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was kind of bittersweet. i kept looking back on my time there, and it made me feel nostalgic <endOfText>
<human> memories can give you mixed emotions sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Since it's summer vacation, I don't get a lot of "me time." A few nights ago, my husband took our daughter to the fair, and I stayed home. <endOfText>

<human> Oh no, why do you think that?  <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> it is good idea. You will be happy helping others. <endOfText>
<human> I haven't recieved that satisfaction yet. Just an unavoidable sense of forgiving. <endOfText>

<human> Awww. : ) What secret is this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to trust that my boyfriend would be where he said he would be after boot camp. He wasn't allowed to use his phone until after the ceremony, so I waited patiently for him in a crowd of people. <endOfText>
<human> You are such a good and patient person,you must really love him <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bumped into an old friend not to long ago! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been exciting. Was your friend much changed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know my wife used to enjoy flirting. But I believe she would not cheat on me. <endOfText>
<human> Flirting is fun. women enjoy it a little more than men do, I believe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my dog. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet. What kind of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A bus hit my car once. It came out of nowhere! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Hey i had a lot of fun graduating! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on your graduation! You must be so proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to steal money from my dad's wallet as a kid. I feel bad about that today. <endOfText>
<human> How old were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a biopsy. I haven't heard the results yet. <endOfText>
<human> Gosh. You must be anxious. How are you coping? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I've finished all my work for the day, and I reward myself with Youtube and a nice comfy sit-down, I feel at peace with the world. Know what I mean? <endOfText>
<human> I know exactly what you mean. Achievement and productivity then rest and relaxation provide a certain level of contentment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like I've done so many wonderful things in my life. I'm just pleasantly peaceful. <endOfText>
<human> That is so great to hear. I hope to be able to say the same one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just came home after totally embarrassing myself. My coat got stuck on a shop's product-display and the whole thing came crashing down! <endOfText>
<human> Well, it will get better. Life happens all the time. We have to just accept it and move on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad and I used to play chess together. I miss that. <endOfText>
<human> Why don't you two play chess together anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are going to the beach on Saturday. It takes a lot of planning to get ready! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I can't wait! We have already started loading the car with some of the things we'll need. We'll be there for a week. <endOfText>
<human> I am so jealous! I hope you pack lots of sunscreen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter s so thoughtful. She hugs me daily before I leave for work. <endOfText>
<human> That's very sweet. My daughters do that too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a wonderful colleague who is awaiting biopsy results. It's so concerning. She's a lovely person. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, dear! You must be anxious for your colleague. I really hope everything comes out alright. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Same here. I'm trying to do everything I can to be supportive while trying to distract her from worrying. <endOfText>
<human> You are a good and caring friend. She is lucky to have you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Some of my friends brag too much about the things they have. It makes me a little green sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> I totally get that. My sister does the same thing. It's hard not to feel envious even if you have a good life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, what happens next? <endOfText>
<human> So i safely reached home. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be able to ride a bike and I enjoyed it, then I injured my leg. I miss that now. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. In time you will be able to ride again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> had to leave my kids with my grandma ,my hubby and I went to Bahamas for the summer holiday <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun. Sometimes its good to get away without the kids. I'm sure they are having  a blast at grandma's house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked very hard and got a lot of raises. I am sure I can get another one <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! It's great to work hard, especially when you people show they actually appreciate what you do.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's awesome! It's great to work hard, especially when you people show they actually appreciate what you do. <endOfText>
<human> Yes. It helps to know I did everything I could and delivered what my boss wanted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently forgot my parent's wedding anniversary. My mom's feelings were really hurt. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sad. did you apologize to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom recently figured out how to use a dual monitor set up at work! I told her I was proud of her. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I bet she is so excited. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She is. She's not very tech-savvy so I was shocked she figured it out! <endOfText>
<human> I can see where you would be shocked. I'm happy for her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> after all it wasn't a good experience <endOfText>
<human> What wasn't a good experience? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I threw away a lot of artwork that my kids did when they were little. <endOfText>
<human>  i can imagine how they felt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i can imagine how they felt <endOfText>
<human> It seemed they mass produced art in preschool and elementary school.  They would come home with scribbled on paper, swirls of fingerpaint, things covered in construction paper.  It was ALOT <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope they didn't get mad at you, some  things like are so precious <endOfText>
<human> Well I did it secretly over the years.  I picked out some of my favorites and tucked them away in a box.  We just found them and it was fun to look at the stuff. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife is having twins soon. I am eager and scared of the delivery date. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! When is she due?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Congratulations! When is she due? <endOfText>
<human> In a few weeks. I'm beside myself with joy and worry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband drove 30 hours this past weekend to get the puppy of my dreams. I was really thankful and excited. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Your husband sound like such a sweet guy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just told me they're going to tour Asia and I was so seethingly jealous I became really awkward. I just started talking super-formally and I didn't know what to really say. <endOfText>
<human> You should ask them if you can tag along! I'm sure they won't mind one bit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These days I feel like I got it all. I'm not rich by any means but I am enriched by a loving wife, children and a dog. <endOfText>
<human> I think I have a problem with jealousy because it's starting all over again. What sort of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was invited to a friend's party the other night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds like a blast! Did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I slipped an fell at work today. I felt like a total fool and had to be taken offsite to a medical clinic. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, that's really rough!  You shouldn't feel foolish though, it could happen to anyone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My small dog lunged and killed a baby bird that had fallen out of its nest. <endOfText>
<human> Did anyone else see what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been with my girlfriend for years and we are celebrating our anniversary soon. I feel like I need to marry her because she's the one for me. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  Do you want to marry her though?  Don't jump into a marriage because it's what people expect. If you're happy as you are, just be happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first ever race, a 5k, is coming up in a few days. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must have trained hard for that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the dog rescue shelter the other day to get a dog. <endOfText>
<human> I love dogs!  Did you find one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to propose to my girlfriend soon. We have been together for a long time and I know she wants the same as me. <endOfText>
<human> That's great news! I'm so happy for you. I've been with my wife for 15 years. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am so sorry to hear that.  Want to talk about what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I had a good friend who just lost their child to leukemia. <endOfText>
<human> im so sorry to hear that :/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog shredded my son's favorite toy. <endOfText>
<human> How old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I have been loyal to the Dallas Cowboys since I met my current love." <endOfText>
<human> Ah, the love is a cowboys fan? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so embarrased when I got the hiccups at my kids sports game <endOfText>
<human> I can totally imagine. Did you do anything to stop them from coming up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried holding my breath but I failed horribly. <endOfText>
<human> That's a bummer! I've always found drinking a bit of water and then holding my breath helps a bit. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's great to be in a committed relationship. Many people might be unnerved at their SO leaving for a week long kayaking trip, but not me. <endOfText>
<human> I agree. I think it is important for couples to be secure enought to be happy that way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a promotion at work! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations. Did you get a raise too? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was wanting my morning cup of coffee before I even went to bed last night <endOfText>
<human> ahh, I know that feeling.  Did you have a stressful day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was invited to a party but I refused because I am married and my spouse was not home. <endOfText>
<human> Is your spouse jealous? Why did you feel you couldn't go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago I lost someone dear to me tragically. It broke my heart and left me feeling like I should have been able to stop it. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear about that. It is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person, especially the good memories.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so sorry to hear about that. It is very hard to lose a loved one but treasure the memories of that person, especially the good memories. <endOfText>
<human> It's really hard. She killed herself. I feel like I failed her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm eagerly awaiting another festive season,especially the black friday". <endOfText>
<human> I stay home on black Friday. Too many people for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so frustrated yesterday. I had to have my mom pick up the kids from school because I had to work late. I'm just glad I can trust her to do that. <endOfText>
<human> It is such a wonderful thing to have a mom who one can depend on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking on the road, hurrying and I slip and fell. There were several people on the road. I felt really bad. <endOfText>
<human> Were you hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thankfully nothing was broken, but I got medication.. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can see envy in the eyes of my colleague after I was promoted". <endOfText>
<human> Did this cause trouble for you at work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought we we're going to be able to close on a new house recently but it didn't work out as planned. <endOfText>
<human> Just remember things happen for a reason. When one door closes another one opens. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Am certain I will make it during my promotional exams". <endOfText>
<human> It's good that you're confident. What subject do your exams cover? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My spouse gave me a gift, a watch. A friend of mine wanted to borrow my watch but I could not lend it to her. It values a lot to me <endOfText>
<human> If it is a treasured gift, your friend should not be asking for it! how did you feel when she did ask you?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If it is a treasured gift, your friend should not be asking for it! how did you feel when she did ask you? <endOfText>
<human> I was surprised because she knew who gave me the gift, but she insisted. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did she understand when you gave her the reason you didn't want to lend it to her? <endOfText>
<human> No! She didn't speak to me for days, she said I was mean and selfish. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She doesn't sound like a good friend to me! <endOfText>
<human> That's exactly what my sister said. She should have understood the reason why I could not lend her the watch. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a test last week and I'm still waiting on the results to come in. <endOfText>
<human> That can be very stressful. I hope you did well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe Janie let me hold her today. it was one of the best moments of my life <endOfText>
<human> Who is Janie? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in a really hot climate and I'm a really sweaty person <endOfText>
<human> That must be really hard to deal with.   have you tried an aluminum free deodorant?  It helps me  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must be really hard to deal with.   have you tried an aluminum free deodorant?  It helps me <endOfText>
<human> That might help my arms, but one time I sweat so much on the way to the store that I had a big sweat stain on my butt! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working at Dairy queen for 5 months now, its fun!\ <endOfText>
<human> I just moved to a small town and we don't have a Dairy Queen here. I used to go to one where I lived before. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared to move so far away from where i grew up and everything I knew but I've been presently surprised by where I am now. I really love it here. <endOfText>
<human> I think i would like to move eventually, but for now i'm barely learning how to be independent, i started abusing drugs at age 14, now 15 years later im barely starting to "grow up" almost a year sober now. hopefully within the next few years I can experience that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family always loved Christmastime. Thinking about christmas makes me happy. <endOfText>
<human> What is your favorite Christmas memory? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can you believe that my child learned how to tap dance at the age of 4? He is now a professional tap dancer! :) <endOfText>
<human> That is so incredible!!! Does he make a lot of money doing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes he does! He is one of the best tap dancers in the world! <endOfText>
<human> That's so awesome.  How old is he now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so grateful to my parents for everything that have done for me growing up :) <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Not too many children are grateful of their parents.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, they really took care of me and were very kind to me growing up. I am so thankful that they were my parents. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! They sound like they are very good parents.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is great. Not too many children are grateful of their parents. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, they really took care of me and were very kind to me growing up. I am so thankful that they were my parents.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is amazing! He's been in the National Guard for 9 years and is a Sargent now. <endOfText>
<human> Wow!! That is amazing! Good for him. You must be really proud and you have every right to be! :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I am. He is an awesome son. <endOfText>
<human> I bet he is! :)  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow!! That is amazing! Good for him. You must be really proud and you have every right to be! :) <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I am. He is an awesome son.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling a little lonely lately.. :( <endOfText>
<human> I can relate, feeling lonely isn't a good thing. How are you coping with it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, recently my best friend moved out of town, so I haven't really had anyone to hang out with. I have been trying to join community events to find new friends. <endOfText>
<human> Losing the companionship of a friend really changes your routine. I'n sure you'll find another friend and you won't be lonely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can relate, feeling lonely isn't a good thing. How are you coping with it? <endOfText>
<human> Well, recently my best friend moved out of town, so I haven't really had anyone to hang out with. I have been trying to join community events to find new friends.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm afraid of heights, but love riding roller coasters. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, yeah I can relate. Being really high up is terrifying, but at least on a roller coaster it is only for a really short and fast period of time!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I remember going to my first theme park. My friends begged me to get on roller coasters and I wouldn't. I finally did and ended up liking it. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, yeah that is great! I am glad you enjoyed the thrill of riding one :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, yeah I can relate. Being really high up is terrifying, but at least on a roller coaster it is only for a really short and fast period of time! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I remember going to my first theme park. My friends begged me to get on roller coasters and I wouldn't. I finally did and ended up liking it.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, how are you doing today <endOfText>
<human> I am great! HOw are you doing today? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Lately, I've been thinking a lot about my grandmother. She passed away recently. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember my grandma being in the hospital a lot when I was little. We were called in quite a few times because she wasn't expected to make it through the night. <endOfText>
<human> That is extremely sad. That must have been difficult. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went shopping this weekend and learned something about myself. <endOfText>
<human> What a strange place for introspection! What did you learn? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so very sure I'd aced my GCSE History exam. I'd written fluently and passionately for the whole hour, and I enjoyed it! <endOfText>
<human> Wow testing that is hard. Glad you enjoyed it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had to go to my old High School. And as soon as I walked in I started thinking back to my teen years. <endOfText>
<human> Very cool, was it for a high school reunion?  Hopefully it brought up good memories! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The memories were good. I was invited by the football coach to talk to the football team. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome!  Hopefully you gave them the motivation they needed for the new year! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend let me borrow some of his old headphones and now I have lost them. <endOfText>
<human> oh no! what are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to meet up with someone who was going buy a guitar from me. He lived 30 minutes away. The guy never answered his door when I got there. <endOfText>
<human> I hate it when that happens. I don't feel like it is necessary to flake,they should be sure before they lead people along. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was so mad.  it was a $400 guitar I was selling or I'd not have driven out that way. I had him banned from the sales app i was using. <endOfText>
<human> That's completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason. hopefully another interested buyer pops up soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just received a phone call that I didn't get the job I applied for. I am devastated. <endOfText>
<human> Aww what a bummer! I am sorry to hear that, there are plenty of more jobs out there though, keep trying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought the cutest little red strapless dress last week, I feel wonderful walking around in it <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Where did you get it from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to spend the day relaxing at home with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds awesome.  Did you guys do anything with the day off or just hang out watching TV? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have had the worst day. This morning, I found a dog lying in the street. It was still alive, so I drove it to the vet. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. That is terrible.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. That is terrible. <endOfText>
<human> It is. I hope everything is going to be okay with her. I have been waiting to hear back from them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Me too. That was very nice of what you did for that dog. <endOfText>
<human> I have a couple of dogs myself, and I know that I would want someone to do that for them, if I wasn't around. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was training a new employee at work last night. She seemed pretty competent. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How did she do by the end of the day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband just bought me a new truck out of the blue! I had no idea I was going to be getting a new one. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!  Are you happy about the purchase? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes! I needed a new one. The other one was falling apart. I am so excited! <endOfText>
<human> I would be too! What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever think you've seen a ghost? <endOfText>
<human> I have seen things I can't explain. I didn't stick around to ask, I ran. But afterwards I was thinking it was a ghost.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I coved my head with the covers and asked them to go away. I never saw them again. found out later that an old couple died in my home. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's scary. And I would have probably done the same thing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have seen things I can't explain. I didn't stick around to ask, I ran. But afterwards I was thinking it was a ghost. <endOfText>
<human> when I was little and moved into a new home I saw lights moving around in my closet one night when I went to bed. I thought it was my brother messing with me but no one was around <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's scary. I'm not sure what I would have done if that were me. What did you do? <endOfText>
<human> I coved my head with the covers and asked them to go away. I never saw them again. found out later that an old couple died in my home.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother just died a few months ago from cancer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm so sorry. How old was she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you. She was 83, She lived a good life. It was just hard watching your best friend suffer in her last days. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, It's nice that her struggle is over and she is in a wonderful place now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to draw a lot when I was younger and I put a lot of emotion in to my work. <endOfText>
<human> Do you still draw? I was never talented in drawing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my spouse was out of town, a friend tried to kiss me! <endOfText>
<human> wow, i do not know either to say, way to go or you better not <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the best day yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby had his first day of school yesterday! It was a huge day, but I made sure to have everything I needed ready to go, to help things run smoothly <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Was it Kindergarten or Pre-School? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my coworkers tried to flirt with me. I told him no because I am happily married. <endOfText>
<human> It's good that your standing up for your marriage like that. A lot of people aren't that committed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, they aren't. But I love my husband so much, I could never do that to him. <endOfText>
<human> You are a wonderful person then. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It took me 26 hours to go from Colorado to Tennessee via gps the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Why do long? Did you walk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That stinks, but I am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery. <endOfText>
<human> Flat and cows for all of creation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad. I ate the rest of husband's cheesecake. I feel like I need to hide from him for a while. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe he will understand, but just in case I'd make him a new one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, just the other day I decided to believe a woman I know about her renting her home to my family. I really thought it would happen, but she will not call me back and it has been days. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow. I hate it when people do things like that. They should just be honest and upfront to begin with instead of causing drama. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waiting for my financial aid to be disbursed. It seems like it's taking forever. I really need to replace my car. <endOfText>
<human> Yea I hate the wait for aid and all the paperwork. Hopefully it is resolved soon so you can ride comfortably. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ran into a street performer recently and I enjoyed his music. <endOfText>
<human> Cool. What kind of instrument were they playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work as a Paramedic and I try to approach each patient as if they were my grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful! It sounds like you really care about each patient.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's wonderful! It sounds like you really care about each patient. <endOfText>
<human> I try to! It can be difficult sometimes which is why I try to have that mindset... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend couldn't make it for Thanksgiving last year. My family and I felt let down about it. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes things come up. It's hard to travel during the holidays. Especially if your friend has kids. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My first dog was the greatest dog ever. Just thinking about her makes me smile a little. <endOfText>
<human> Dogs are really the best aren't they? They are the greatest friends we can ask for. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yeah, I was feeling kind of bad because I ended up lying and canceling plans with a close friend. <endOfText>
<human> maybe you had a good reason to do this <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad saved a piece of pizza for his lunch the next day. he was not happy when he woke up and checked the fridge. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, did someone else eat the pizza?  Was that someone you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell of my motorcycle in front of a crowd. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! That's terrible! Were you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I met my friend for coffee this morning, I had indigestion. I passed gas and it smelled terrible. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you walk away lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew just asked me for advice about his girlfriend. His friends were telling him that she was cheating on him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's terrible. What did you tell him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told him that he needed to be prepared if he finds out the truth and it's not what he want's to hear. He said that his friend said she was meeting some guy at the movies. I gave him a ride to the theater. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's good advice. I hope it worked out for him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, when I was cleaning the cupboards, I dropped an antique tea cup and it shattered. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased. Either way I'm sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. Was it something that was in the family or was it something that you purchased. Either way I'm sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<human> It was my grandmother's so I was very sad about it. Thank you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have two uncles and they both died within 3 months of each otehr <endOfText>
<human> That's very sad, I'm sorry. I have had family members pass as well and it is never easy.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you! I felt awful for my grandmother since they were her two only sons. <endOfText>
<human> That poor woman. Hopefully she is going to be all right.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's very sad, I'm sorry. I have had family members pass as well and it is never easy. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you! I felt awful for my grandmother since they were her two only sons.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a theme park recently and got on this roller coaster <endOfText>
<human> Really! Did you have fun?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not really. :( It didn't seem very safe.. it was a really old rickety, wooden one that looked like it was about to fall apart. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That sounds scary. Some of the rollercoasters can be very well built while others are very sketchy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Really! Did you have fun? <endOfText>
<human> Not really. :( It didn't seem very safe.. it was a really old rickety, wooden one that looked like it was about to fall apart.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got all of my vaccines I needed for a trip to Asia. They cover everything and now I feel fully prepared to go! <endOfText>
<human> Cool, is there a particular country that you're visiting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched the movie Ponyo with my kids last night. It was quite wholesome, cute, and we all liked it! <endOfText>
<human> I've never heard of it - what's it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This spring I got to go visit with my dad who I haven't seen in ten years! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great! Did you have a good visit? I hope it wasn't awkward.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds great! Did you have a good visit? I hope it wasn't awkward. <endOfText>
<human> We went camping and fishing and we really had a great time catching up. We didn't miss a beat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Very cool. My own father passed away a few years ago. I miss doing things with him. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, I'm so sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not long ago a met a woman and felt totally in sync with her, right off the bat. We started dating and things were going really well. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome when that kind of thing happens. Are you guys together now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nope. Things went incredibly well for about a month, then she broke things off abruptly. Totally unexpected. <endOfText>
<human> Aww man. Well be thankful it happened sooner than later. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've had a 20 year relationship end. Compared to that, this one was easy. <endOfText>
<human> My brother just went thru the same thing recenly. He is so much happier without this girl he was dating. she was alot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hopefully, he'll find the right person for him. <endOfText>
<human> I think he has already. lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just tried a new restaurant that everyone has been talking about? <endOfText>
<human> Did you? Was it good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was better than I thought it would be. I was pleasantly surprised. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. I may have to try it out. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday, I spring cleaned my entire house. Then I sat down and enjoyed a book. <endOfText>
<human> That's a great achievement! What book did you decide to read? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the airport and someone cut me in line. It was ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! That stinks! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on my way to work and I met a stranger who offered me a ride to work. <endOfText>
<human> Well that was nice.  Do you normally walk? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the store about two weeks ago and I didn't know my shirt was inside out and backwards until the cashier told me. <endOfText>
<human> I could have took the day off,but I went in anyway. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was it a good decision? <endOfText>
<human> Yes it was <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cheating at anything is just not my cup o tea <endOfText>
<human> I agree, cheating isn't rewarding.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, cheating isn't rewarding. <endOfText>
<human> At all dont do anything during the day you cant sleep with at nite. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree with that one hundred percent. <endOfText>
<human> yes  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son starts high school this year. It seems like just yesterday, that he was a toddler in pre-school. <endOfText>
<human> Time flies. Does this make you feel sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been dieting the last two months, and so far, I've lost aboout 30 pounds! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's amazing! You must be proud! What is your secret? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was babysitting for my daughter and she didn't come back until 1 am! <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, that's pretty darn late! Did you ask her why she was out so long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday is coming up later this week. I'm so excited! <endOfText>
<human> Well Happy early Birthday!  I hope you enjoy it, when it comes.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well Happy early Birthday!  I hope you enjoy it, when it comes. <endOfText>
<human> Thank you so much! I can't wait to have a special cake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm excited football season is right around the corner. <endOfText>
<human> Me, too! Do you have a favorite team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do, The Dallas Cowboys.  Do you have a favorite team? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, that's my favorite team, too! Yay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just made a huge move across the country , and I don't know if it was the right choice. <endOfText>
<human> Oh thats scary. I've been there. Just give it some time to feel right. Home is where ever you want it to be. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found something tucked away in my closet that got me choked up and sad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a hand written note from my dead mother. I never had read or seen it before. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that must have been very shocking. At least you can keep it to remember her by. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter's boyfriend got drunk and attacked my husband. <endOfText>
<human> my goodness i feel terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i sure wish my family didnt find out <endOfText>
<human> What? You think you might be in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The ducks that visit my back yard had babies! They're so soft and fuzzy. <endOfText>
<human> Ducks are really cute, especially babies. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend invited me over to share Thanksgiving with him and his family a while ago. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds lovely! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw an amazing deal for a car on Craigslist! I couldn't think about anything until I got a chance to see it! <endOfText>
<human> That's cool, what was the deal for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> visiting an old place is great <endOfText>
<human> Did you visit one recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is in the Army and recently he graduated first in the class from recruiting school at Ft. Knox. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I am so proud of your son, you should be proud as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom was sick and I took a couple days from work just to take care of her. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you. Is she feeling better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I took a test for a promotion at work. I felt pretty good about it. <endOfText>
<human> Did you pass? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to have a bunch of surgeries this past year. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no, I hope you're okay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I'm good now. I feel like things are going to be good for the foreseeable future. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I hope things keep looking up for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was just a little kid my parents let my brother and I get a dog, and he was the best but unfortunately he passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is so sad. What kind of dog was he. How long did he live for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Probably the worst time of my life was when my second marriage ended. It lasted over 20 years and much of my life and plans for the future were intricately bound within that relationship. <endOfText>
<human> I can imagine that would be very painful. Are you doing better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it's been a few years and I've managed to chart a new course for myself. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad to here that, I'm sure that moving forward after something as difficult as that is very emotionally difficult. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a teenager, I once snuck out of the house at night and didn't get back home until 4 am. When I got back my mom was waiting for and had been worried sick all night. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get in much trouble? I was allowed to kind of run wild, so never had any issues with staying out till sunrise.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you get in much trouble? I was allowed to kind of run wild, so never had any issues with staying out till sunrise. <endOfText>
<human> Not huge trouble. I was generally a pretty good kid, and it wasn't like I had gone out drinking as I have never enjoyed the taste of alcohol. She told me I just needed to be honest with her and check in when I was going to be out late. I still felt bad about it worrying her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I went on a first date with my now fiance, he picked me up in his black shiny new Cadillac XLR. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, it sounds like a great time with him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a hurricane on the way to my home. I have all my emergency supplies ready to go. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I'm glad you have gotten your self prepared for a big blow. I hope you stay safe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently asked a coworker of mine to cover a shift for another employee. <endOfText>
<human> Where they able to cover for the other employee? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little sister told me last week that she is going to name her son after me! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats to your family! What an honor that is. May I ask the name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, I let one of my friends take my Benz one day to run some errands. I really thought she would be careful with it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! Did she damage your car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, she hit a parked car at the super market. She's okay, but I am not sure I will let her use it ever again. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. I would be extra careful if I was driving someone else's car...especially Benz! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my neighbor mowed his lawn yesterday, he ran over my flower bed. All of my flowers were destroyed. <endOfText>
<human> my goodness so terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just feel lost <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no. I'm sorry you feel lost! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just don't know what to do. I was in such a rush. Should I go back? <endOfText>
<human> No just go ahead and keep going.  It will be fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared at first because the water looked cold and the pool was deep.  When I saw my Dad's face however, I knew he would catch me so I jumped in the water. <endOfText>
<human> So... was it cold? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost gave away my steam cleaner because it was leaking all over the place. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Have you looked up the user manual, or taken it to a repairman to get it fixed/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to try and fix it which I did successfully. Yesterday I spilled my drink on the carpet and used my now fixed steam cleaner to clean up. glad I didn't get rid of it <endOfText>
<human> That takes some real hard work to fix something like that. I am sure it came in handy for cleaning up that stain. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's one more thing I know how to do. good for saving some money for sure.; <endOfText>
<human> That is true, being able to fix your own stuff is a valuable skill to have.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was pretty nervous for my first date with my now girlfriend. I had previously been in a relationship for a long time, and it had been quite awhile since I'd been on a date. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that's understandable. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid, we used to make caramel apples every fall. They're such a wonderful treat. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I love caramel apples! They're one of my favorite treats in the fall. Did you guys make your own caramel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> have you ever had some do something for you that you were not expecting? <endOfText>
<human> yes. both good and bad. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We used to be best friends but when she became president she started excluding me from everything <endOfText>
<human> Who did , tell me more <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son showed up at our door unexpectedly one day. He is in the Army and stationed in California! <endOfText>
<human> wow, that must have been a surprise and a joy for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I planted vegetables in my garden. I can't wait until they sprout! <endOfText>
<human> Nothing like fresh veggies! What did you plant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once we were taking a drive and our dog got loose. He came home a few days later. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! That must have been so scary! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling really down that he would be gone. He blew me away with this, never saw it coming. <endOfText>
<human> Hi friend! I am not sure who you are talking about. Who blew you away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband gave me a really beautiful ring that belonged to his great grandmother. I cherish it every time I wear it. <endOfText>
<human> that is so nice that he trust you with such a keepsake <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. It means a lot to both to us. She was a very lovely lady. <endOfText>
<human> i'm sure sure was. was it a special occasion when he gave you the ring? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so this past sunday i cooked my first meal for my family. it turned out really good. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sounds so exciting! What did you make? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> seafood pasta, im so proud of myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, sounds yummy! I love seafood.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, sounds yummy! I love seafood. <endOfText>
<human> me too, i even made my own sauce <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a little girl, we had a house fire and it burned to the ground. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  How did that happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It came from next door. Someone knocked over a kerosene stove. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible.  I hope you and your family made it out okay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at my mom's house doing some pet sitting for her recently, and I found an old family photo album. It was interesting going back through it and reminiscing. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a lot of fun! Did you discover anything new? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh gosh I just got in a wreck and totaled my brand new car!!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!! That is terrible! Are you ok? Will your insurance cover it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion I wanted, even though my boss said it was virtually guaranteed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Did he give you a reason why? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A close family friend died in a car accident recently. I had know him since I was a kid, so it was relly painful for me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that, Are you handling it ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father died a few years ago, and I keep his cologne to remember him by. <endOfText>
<human> It'd nice you have a memento like that to remember him by. Did he wear it often? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend and I did a lot around the house last weekend. It was nice he didn't have to work. Come monday morning I knew I was really gonna miss him. <endOfText>
<human> That's so nice! He sounds like a keeper! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so behind on my housework. I have a pile of laundry that I've been neglecting... <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I hate it when that happens. Makes you feel disorganized in your thoughts even. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lived with this girl once and I trusted her. Found out I never should have. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, sorry to hear that man. Yeah girls are hard to trust these days. What's up with that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We were driving and suddenly our car stopped working in the middle of the freeway. It was shocking, and our hazard lights weren't working. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible! I hope no one got hurt.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is terrible! I hope no one got hurt. <endOfText>
<human> We were safe! Thankfully someone was able to tow us away quickly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sad. My 15 year old cat just died. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry that is tough. What breed was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was a Siamese cat. It's been a week and I can't stop crying. <endOfText>
<human> Aw! Life ends sadly. Have you thought about getting another cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the store yesterday to see if the bakery had fresh baked glazed doughnuts. <endOfText>
<human> I love doughnuts. Did they have them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the grocery store, while at the cashier i realized that I could not find my debit card. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you end up finding it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, I felt really bad. I ended up leaving the groceries. <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's too bad. Sorry to hear. I lost my debit once, I don't think I ever found mine either.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke up with my girlfriend a week ago so now I'm adjusting to single life. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that. That can be a hard adjustment to make.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that. That can be a hard adjustment to make. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, I'm taking it one day at a time and I realize that it will be a process. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was about 5 I saw my dog get run over by a tractor. The vet said we should think about putting him down because it could have brain damage. I threw a fit in the clinic when he said that. <endOfText>
<human> That's crazy, I can't believe your dog survived. Did you end up putting him down? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No Dobie was around when I graduated High School. That was one tough doberman. <endOfText>
<human> That's really impressive, I'm glad he was able to keep living and supporting you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had this really hard test at school the other day. I am pretty sure I aced it. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What class was it for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Bio-engineering. It was really hard. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! You must be very smart. There's no way I'd be any good at bio-engineering. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I were really struggling to get pregnant. I was very upset about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm sorry. I can image how you feel. My son and his wife are trying to get pregnant right now as well.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, I'm sorry. I can image how you feel. My son and his wife are trying to get pregnant right now as well. <endOfText>
<human> I ended up having to go to the doctor because I was so freaked out. Eventually it just happened though and now she's 9 months old! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This morning, I went outside to harvest vegetables from my garden. I discovered that animals had gotten to them first, though. <endOfText>
<human> How will you keep them out? It must be something that you can do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend proposed last night!! <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! That's awesome! How long have you two been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We bought a barn cat and he is super annoying. He always sits at the front door of our house instead of staying at the barn! <endOfText>
<human> LOL that sucks. What are you gonna do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got invited to a party by some friends. I felt a little down because I got invited and I didn't try to get my brother an invitation. <endOfText>
<human> Do your friends not get along with your brother? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been pet sitting for my mom while she is on vacation, and I've gotten close with one of her cats. She's just the sweetest little thing! <endOfText>
<human> That's so great! What type of cat is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was crashing on a boy once and he came to me to tell me he was in love with my best friend <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That must've felt awful, I'm sorry! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so at ease and happy when my husband is home with me. I don't like being home alone <endOfText>
<human> that's sweet. You guys must have a great relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, we do. He just makes me for so happy and satisfied. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. How long have you been married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife bought us a super comfortable double recliner, and every since we got it, I never want to get out of it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice! I need one of those! My couch is so uncomfortable. It would be hard to get out of a new recliner for me as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got to use my new coffee pot from a brand I've never tried. wow, that's good coffee! <endOfText>
<human> Nice that it worked out so well for you! What brand did you end up going with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So a few nights ago I was awoken to a spider crawling across me in bed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh heck no! Were you able to get back to sleep? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> once i got my favorite pen with me and i got full score.. is it not a lucky charm? <endOfText>
<human> I suppose it is, but I wonder if the fact that you studied might have had more to do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i do accept , even then i believe in miracles!! <endOfText>
<human> Well I am glad you got a good score. And faith is not a bad thing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went through some pretty tough times. Still, I believed things would get better eventually. <endOfText>
<human>  it is a good sign of positivity i guess..  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Absolutely. Things did get better as a matter of fact. <endOfText>
<human> yes.. only thing we should do is to be patience and the rest will be okay .. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it is a good sign of positivity i guess.. <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely. Things did get better as a matter of fact.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i waited years and years but i finale did it <endOfText>
<human> Oh really! What did you do?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I'm gonna lose my doggie soon. <endOfText>
<human> oh no what happened <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my first trip overseas was to Rome as a college freshman. that was many years ago. hope to go back soon. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I've been to a lot of countries but would love to go to Italy. I am envious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I are taking a vacation to Maine this fall, and I've never been before! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting.   What do you plan on seeing while there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My most treasured item is her ornament that she had for her cat Barney.   That cat was her world. <endOfText>
<human> I had a cat named Barney too! We was a one-eyed grey tabby. What kind of ornament is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Junior year in high school we made it to the state championship in football. The coach would let the captains say a few motivational words before we got off the bus. So he called me to say something. I told my teammates that if they didn't plan on winning the trophy don't get off the bus then I sat down. <endOfText>
<human> That's not a bad response, how did the team take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They were quiet it was supposed to be a two minute speech. The bus driver said you guys better listen he looks serious. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, Did yall win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> WE won 60 - 3 <endOfText>
<human> congratz! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I accidentally got someone fired for something at work. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds bad. I know it wasn't intentional but what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds bad. I know it wasn't intentional but what happened? <endOfText>
<human> The person bragged about doing something, that they didn't actually do. Which was highly inappropriate for the job we had. I had to tell the manager due to liability issues. All for it to not even be true. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well you did what you were supposed to do. It's their fault for saying what they said. <endOfText>
<human> I agree, but still feels bad to get someone fired at times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i tell you i was red all over <endOfText>
<human> Why? were you mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was trying to use my smart tv to watch a movie and my internet kept disconnecting. <endOfText>
<human> awe man thats the worst <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried reconnectiong and it would work for a while and then disconnect again. it was a really good movie too! <endOfText>
<human> thats really sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> what an odd memory to crop up. my dog jetted outside anytime he could and one night managed to get out and the car that hit him had no time to stop.. dark and right in front of our house. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's awful!  What happened to your dog? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> years ago I think I was in middle school at the time, he'd gotten out and met his fate when a car couldn't stop in time. It's an odd memory to pop up. maybe because i've just seen a bunch of pet posts from my friends on fb. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that.  That must have been tough at that age. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a water park years ago. Aas I was going down one of the slides, my top slid up and I was exposed. I was so humiliated. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds terrible, but I'm sure it's happened to other people before.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, but ever since then, i refuse to go down slides at the water park. <endOfText>
<human> You shouldn't let one bad incident ruin water parks for you. You're probably the only one that remembers and still thinks about that incident. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds terrible, but I'm sure it's happened to other people before. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, but ever since then, i refuse to go down slides at the water park.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was working on this project for 6 years and the deadline was coming up. I knew we should have asked for 7 years of funding but my boss said 6 would be enough. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? Did you finish the project? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my daughter totally lied through her teeth right to my face yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Hopefully that is the first time that has happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> 101 degrees this weekend. I would rather go out to a brewery. Instead I promised friends I'd help them move. SMH <endOfText>
<human> Help them move and then have them take you out to the brewery as thanks. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ooo i like your way of thinking. <endOfText>
<human> I don't drink so have a drink for me lol.     <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't drink so have a drink for me lol. <endOfText>
<human> if we're not dead wiped out from the heat of the day i'll have a beer for ya. if we are, i'll be drowning myself in ice cold water and we'll definitely drink more than a few of those for ya! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still feel the loss of my 19 year old cat Lexi.  She was my first pet as an adult. <endOfText>
<human> oh man. was just talking to someone about that type of thing. i had a pet dog who was hit by a car back when I was in jr high. i have friends who have recently lost their lifelong pets and i know they're still reeling to some extent. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it hurts but I felt lucky to have had her in my life.  Send your friends a hug from me. <endOfText>
<human> i will indeed. thank you. back at ya. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am sooo excited! I just found out my husband is buying me a new car for my birthday! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Do you know what kind of car you're getting yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello, how are you today <endOfText>
<human> i am very good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate that my daughter is growing, she wanted me to drop off at the movies <endOfText>
<human> Was she wanting to go with friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know, you just never know how she will handle a dangerous situation. I talk to mine all the time about things that could happen. <endOfText>
<human> i agree <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just knew my daughter could pull it off! <endOfText>
<human> pull what off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been happy married for 10 years. <endOfText>
<human> That's a long time! You and your partner must really love eachother. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> just moved into a new apartment last weekend. pretty happy with it. a little smaller but a 5 yo complex as opposed to a 45 year old complex. modern amenities are nice. also, i'm going to visit my family tomorrow. good week so far. <endOfText>
<human> It feels good to be in a new place, but the moving process sucks. Is it a new part of town? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, what's up? <endOfText>
<human> hey, how are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate taking test <endOfText>
<human> Me too, it is to stressing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom borrowed my car last week. I wasn't worried. <endOfText>
<human> That's good! It can sometimes be hard trusting others with expensive belongings. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My very first boyfriend ever cheated on me. When I found out I was so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Well, it is good that you did not marry him. I had a husband who cheated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> beautiful friend of mine. i had gone to visit and walked in a room i normally put my coat when i get to her house and she was in various states of undress. i don't think you've ever seen anyone turn around and get out of a room so quickly. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you were embarrassed.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you were embarrassed. <endOfText>
<human> very much so. we laugh about it now years later but yeah talk about turning 5 shades of red quickly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i want it to rail today <endOfText>
<human> Did you mean rain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like rain myself. We've been getting a good amount here, during the past month or so. <endOfText>
<human> its been so hot and dry here <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We've had an uncharacteristically mild summer. I'm hoping it continues. <endOfText>
<human> consider yourself lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A close friend of mine recently told me he was filing for divorce. I've known him and his wife for decades, so I'm concerned for them both. <endOfText>
<human> thats horrible, divorce is the last result.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. Unfortunately, they have kids as well. <endOfText>
<human> are the kids old enough to understand whats going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. They're in their early teens, or near it. <endOfText>
<human> i guess thats a positive. they can understand that their life will be somewhat different <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> thats horrible, divorce is the last result. <endOfText>
<human> Yes. Unfortunately, they have kids as well.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember my mom taking be to my dorm to check in for college. I was excited and nervous at the same time. <endOfText>
<human> I remember that too, it's interesting transitioning to a more independent lifestyle. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's what I was excited about. Independence and starting something new. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, I imagine that you still missed your family while getting involved and having new experiences. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was babysitting a few days ago and my cousin kept throwing her food on the floor. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been frustrating. What did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must have been frustrating. What did you do? <endOfText>
<human> I kept cleaning it up and put down a bunch of towels around her to protect the floor. I think it comes with the territory, she gets what she wants. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my close friend stole from me, im upset! <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible. Did you confront your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was rear ended last Friday while sitting at a stop light. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did they stick around to exchange info? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I have the info. I just left the adjuster a message before I started talking to you. <endOfText>
<human> Oh good. At least they were responsible enough to that with you. I'm glad your ok. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished eating a fantastic meat loaf. I've been cooking a lot lately and am pleased with my results. <endOfText>
<human> i love meat loaf <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It keeps my blood sugar from spiking. <endOfText>
<human> ok, i do low carm too <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to a local restaurant , but the gloves that they wore touch everything including my food. ugh <endOfText>
<human> You mean the kitchen staff? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I try not to think to much about kitchen sanitation when I go out to eat. <endOfText>
<human> neither do I, but i seen it with my own eyes.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think someone stole my headphones recently. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Do you have a suspect? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man, my best friend just got a Lamborghini! I am so envious of her. I've always wanted one. <endOfText>
<human> She's balling hard, I'm sure that her new toy will serve as motivation for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, hopefully someday I can have one. At least she was nice and gave me a ride in it. <endOfText>
<human> That's splendid and it should help you decide if you want an interior similar to hers or completely different in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> growing up my mom played a lot of Aretha Franklin. Naturally when I heard she passed I was shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Awww. I'm sorry to hear that. Aretha means a lot to you I see <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I have a special place in my heart for classic music. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure. She was a very good singer.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching Aretha Franklin videos this weekend and it made me think about being young and my mom listening to her albums. <endOfText>
<human> Aww, my mom used to listen to her too? Did she sing along and dance like mine did too? Used to love that when I was little. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That made me smile. My mom and your mom are soul sisters. <endOfText>
<human> Ain't that the truth! Miss those days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One birthday I could not believe my eyes! <endOfText>
<human> Why, what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's a present that you love and it can love you back. That's the best present. <endOfText>
<human> I know! I named him Jake. He is laying next to me by my feet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm listening to this audiobook and it's so scary, I could cry <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it's good to face our fears, or turn on every light in the house. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will always remember the day I found out I was pregnant with my first child. I was so happy and hurried out to get a card and gift for my husband to surprise him. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. My wife and I will hopefully be in that same boat soon. Was he excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was on pins in needles waiting for the arrival of my first born <endOfText>
<human> but i bet you feel all better now right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am finally pregnant after years of trying! <endOfText>
<human> wow, thats so awesome! make sure you take care of yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i stole some money from my brother and he realized it was gone, but i haven't said anything. I think I should <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it might be a good idea to tell him. But you may want to have the money to give back to him first.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah it might be a good idea to tell him. But you may want to have the money to give back to him first. <endOfText>
<human> well I feel bad because I used it... on some drugs that I needed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I checked the mail box one day and had a letter from a University I wanted to go to. <endOfText>
<human> hey that's awesome! You won't have to steal money like me. Which University was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Texas Christian University TCU. But the stealing thing is going catch up to you. <endOfText>
<human> Oh a Christian University that is nice. Well I needed my drugs <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The only thing christian about TCU is the name. I'm on scholarship. <endOfText>
<human> oh okay that's good. I should apply because of my diabetes insulin is expensive.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was dating someone else when I met the man who is now my husband. I thought he was just going to be a friend, but I eventually developed feelings for him. <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Did the other person know what was going on? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my daughters boyfriend is so respectful. I really like him. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. I hope she found someone who treats her well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm supposed to visit my sister's family for thanksgiving this year, but I'm not really looking forward to it. We haven't gotten along over the past several years. <endOfText>
<human> Sibling rivalries are unfortunate. Hopefully you two can patch things up one day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe. She has a lot of mental difficulties that makes it hard to be around her. Short visits are okay, but anything longer than that gets uncomfortable. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, i see. I hope you end up going and find a way to enjoy yourself. Family is all that matters in the end.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel like things are falling into place with my life <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Any specifics? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just with my career, relationships and family. I was a little lost there for awhile. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad things are on the right track. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son recently came home from his grandparents and had a gift for me. I was so excited! <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that's sweet. What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was outside watering my flowers and seen a snake <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, how scary! What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going on a vacation, so I made sure to pack everything that I would need. <endOfText>
<human> nice, its good to be organized before you go on vacation <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is installing a wood boiler for our home to heat our house this Winter. I'm so impressed with him because he's doing it all on his own. <endOfText>
<human> That is impressive.  Is he normally pretty handy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got a $50 gift card that I'm really looking forward to using. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I'd be excited too. What are you going to get with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm looking at some D&D/RPG stuff. Maybe the Avengers Infinity War Blu Ray. <endOfText>
<human> That's fun. I just watched that move this weekend. I really enjoyed it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am eagrly awaiting fevershly <endOfText>
<human> Is that uncomfortable for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was recently promoted at work, I was a bit surprise but happy. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! Did they just come in and say hey guess what you're getting promoted <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was talking to my mom one day and she was telling me that my step dad was having some heart issues. He was in the middle of a big garden project and could not finish. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Do they know what the issue with his heart is.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sorry to hear that.  Do they know what the issue with his heart is. <endOfText>
<human> They ran some tests and could not pin point what was wrong so he is just taken it easy. I decided to take a weekend and go over and finish the garden. He was pretty happy about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's good. I'm glad it wasn't something urgent and he got to finish in the garden. <endOfText>
<human> Yep, now all he has to do is water it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a huge football fan but wasn't happy about last season. <endOfText>
<human> Did your team not do so good? I know mine sure didn't. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dallas <endOfText>
<human> Nice, I like them too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister took my best friend to the movie instead of me, I was really sad. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me sad too.  Was there any reason she took your friend and not you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i lost my sisters dog <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I hope that's not the end of the story. Did you find it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no. I hope that's not the end of the story. Did you find it? <endOfText>
<human> no, looked everywhere <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's sad, hopefully it finds its way home. <endOfText>
<human> yes, hopefully he can find his way back home <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got bar-b-que from a place a few weeks ago and it literally tasted like the got it out of a dumpster. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, who messes up bbq <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have no idea but it was the worst taste ever. It tasted rotten. <endOfText>
<human> probably bad meat <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone knocked on my door the other day. I peaked around the corner so they could not see me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh boy, was it someone you didn't want to talk to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know anyone and was alone so I wasn't sure if I should answer the door. Things are getting pretty scary in the world. <endOfText>
<human> You can never be too careful! I've heard too many things in the news. Who did it end up being? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i walked in there and strutted my stuff like a peacock <endOfText>
<human> haha good for you!  Where were you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was 17, I held a neighbor's baby and she puked alllll over me. <endOfText>
<human> my dear thats gross <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it's annoying isn't it? You're expecting a check or something else to be delivered to you based on what you were told and yet it looks like that schedule won't be adhered to. That's where I was a few weeks ago. <endOfText>
<human> Yes that is annoying! How long did you have to wait? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the darned thing arrived while i was out of town. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thats no fun at all. I guess you could look at it as money saved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Had my daughter over a couple weekends ago. She had brought a scrapbook she put together herself of us. <endOfText>
<human> very cool! how old is she? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that's incredibly thoughtful! <endOfText>
<human> I know. Love her to death. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i love having my kitty friends i make them dinner everyday <endOfText>
<human> Is it a stray or a pet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im excited about the holidays, i love christmas <endOfText>
<human> Oh me too. Have you been saving up for a good one this year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was happy my mom gave me her old car but then I wasn't as much later down the road <endOfText>
<human> what changed your mind about the car <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I attended a Tony Bennett concert in April. It was amazing! <endOfText>
<human> Ah that is cool. Good to get it while he is still performing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I was walking my dogs today and I tripped over Boomer's feet! As if that wasn't bad enough I was in front of the school and everyone saw me fall that was dropping off their kids <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did anyone come over to help or did you try to get out of there asap? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you just love buying brand new sheets? <endOfText>
<human> I do love new sheets. The higher the thread count the bette, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my final exams and I am awaiting the results. I pray that I will pass with a good grade. <endOfText>
<human> Whew, always a rough time. How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job once that I really wanted. I can remember nervously waiting for a call back. <endOfText>
<human> Did you end up getting that job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, they called me back like a week later. <endOfText>
<human> Oh awesome. I would have been nervous to if it was something I really wanted. glad you got the job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Don't you hate it when you swimming with someone who's got a big bugger hanging out of their nose? <endOfText>
<human> Yes that's the worst. And I laughed when I read that.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes that's the worst. And I laughed when I read that. <endOfText>
<human> once in my early twenties I remember going to a party and everyone was in the pool. I got in the pool and splashed around and didn't realize I had a huge green bugger coming out of my nose. A really cute guy pointed that out for me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That had to be traumatic. <endOfText>
<human> Omg. my face was so red it was purple! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, when I was first out on my own, my car got broken into. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's awful, was anything valuable stolen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I left my wallet on the train last week, i was so relieved once i had found out it was returned back in. <endOfText>
<human> Close call! i would be pretty upset to lose my wallet.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Close call! i would be pretty upset to lose my wallet. <endOfText>
<human> I was at the time! It had a ton of cash and cards in too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the DMV for my drivers license. It was my first time going there. <endOfText>
<human> Exciting! Were you nervous going in?  Did you take your test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have this huge presentation at work tomorrow and if the investors like my idea I can land 3 big accounts for my company. <endOfText>
<human> That is very exciting, I bet you are nervous for your presentation. A lot is riding on it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is normal to feel nervous when working on something so important. I try to remember that it will soon be over. That helps me sleep. <endOfText>
<human> I have a feeling I'll be counting lots of sheep tonight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently decided to start blogging again and feel pretty good about it. I used to have a decent sized audience, so hopefully I can build it back up. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure if you can let people know that you're back blogging, they'd come back to see what you're up to now!  What do you blog about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Old school tabletop RPG's. The blogging scene is still fairly active so getting back involved with the network should be easy. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds amazing!  I haven't played tabletops in forever.  The last one I played was called "Car Wars" and it was at a New Year's party.  It was loads of fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I parked my car at the Walmart parking lot and someone used a car to hit my car. <endOfText>
<human> that is terrible, i hope you were not hurt <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband might get transferred to a new position and that means we might get to move closer to family. <endOfText>
<human> that is nice, family is fun to be around <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm working on a new Dungeons & Dragons campaign for my players and have been busy in my spare time getting everything ready. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like fun. When will you play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually run games on Sunday's but it'll be another month or so before we start. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like you will be well prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Goodness, I was working the concession stand at Emma's ball game. I bent over to grab a box of crackers and split my pants open!!! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh!!! That's pretty funny. Did anyone see what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thankfully you had a sweater, but geez how embarrassing. <endOfText>
<human> No doubt about it, next time I'm wearing an extra pair of pants! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I go to a bar with my girlfriends and a guy offers to buy me a drink, I always decline because I have a boyfriend. I wouldn't want to lead anyone on and have them spend money on me! <endOfText>
<human> Girl, take that drink and don't be ashamed. At least you wouldn't have to pay for the drink! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my kid starts preschool in a week. <endOfText>
<human> That is really exciting, I bet it will be hard to let them go. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will probably cry then celebrate. I'm excited but a little sad at once. <endOfText>
<human> It is so exciting to watch them grow up, I am sure it will be an emotional moment. But it will be a good one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few days ago, I was looking through a bunch of old photo albums. <endOfText>
<human> Were you looking for something in particular or just for fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year our football team managed to win the league despite being underdogs the entire season! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! Congratulations. I can just imagine how excited you were. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the day that I met my husband. A friend introduced him and he was very shy. <endOfText>
<human> How many years ago was it? What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work 24 hour shifts and have been working so much lately. I have two beach trips coming up in September and I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> You must be really looking forward to that. Sounds exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really looking forward to Christmas, I would like to get lots of presents. <endOfText>
<human> Christmas is so much fun! Are you asking for anything in particular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughet made the volleyball team <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Congrats to her!  I bet she worked hard. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This year will be my very first time hosting Thanksgiving. <endOfText>
<human> really, that is awesome. you will have fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my kids made it back from summer break <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice to hear! You have a full house again! Did they have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i ate all of the ice cream today, i feel bad <endOfText>
<human> Why? How much did you eat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was waiting on my best friend to come over so we could watch a movie but she did not show up. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. I now that must have been a let down. Can you guys reschedule? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my sis ate all of my snacks yesterday <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! I bet you were mad! Was she very sorry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our little dog got out of the yard and got hit by a car... <endOfText>
<human> sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a 50-50 raffle ticket last night at the fair. <endOfText>
<human> That is daring! I do hope that you will win. What are the prizes? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving and I saw a man hitting a dog. It got me so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That is horrible! Did you do anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stopped, got out of my car and told him to stop. I then called the police. <endOfText>
<human> Good for you! Animals need people like you! Very heroic!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good for you! Animals need people like you! Very heroic! <endOfText>
<human> We as people need to protect animals. They are innocent. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dog got out of the gate and got hit by a car <endOfText>
<human> Oh yikes! Is your dog ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my father died, I thought me and my mom were alone. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear about that, treasure the memories that you have about your dad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened my patio door and saw a big rat. I was so frightened. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! What did you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i los left my purse in the restroom at the local store, its gone <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that is terrible. Hopefully you did not have much money inside. I guess the worst part is all the cards that have to be replaced. So sorry to hear this. :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so tired of seeing half naked women aka the Kardashians all over the tv and internet. <endOfText>
<human> i agree with you on that one it can be very frustrating seeing that all the time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved across country with my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> That's a big change, adjusting well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice, sometimes a change of scenery is good. I need to move out of this crap state. <endOfText>
<human> What state is that? Bound to be better than TN was for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my daughter past her drivers test <endOfText>
<human> That is great news!! ...... but a little scary at the same time. lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I have been worried about my hubs working out of state so much. But he is always calling and texting me while he's gone. <endOfText>
<human> Well that's a good sign. He knows you probably miss him and he wants you to know he's thinking aboutcha. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a 50-50 raffle ticket at the fair a few nights ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, have they done the draw for that yet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so excited to get my dog DNA test back. I can hardly wait! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I've never heard of a dog DNA test before. What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yes, he is going to be really mad. He loves his car, it's like his baby. <endOfText>
<human> I bet he does.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet he does. <endOfText>
<human> I want to tell him about it but I don't know how. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so afraid about my sister's illness. What will we do? <endOfText>
<human> That is gross. Did you find out who left it there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i dont have to cook tonight <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awesome, how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I once on my first day of the job as manager slipped and fell in front of my coworkers. <endOfText>
<human> omg, did you hurt yourself bad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time when i was little i threw a rock at a glass door and broke it and then blamed it on my brother. <endOfText>
<human> I'm pretty sure I've done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life, so don't feel bad, lol. He would probably laugh about it now if you told him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend told me a secret <endOfText>
<human> Was it a good one? Did you keep it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> lol, its one of the them <endOfText>
<human> Well tell them I said Congrats on whatever it is. As long as it's not a baby marriage. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man on the months before my move across country, Time seemed to go so slow. <endOfText>
<human> cross country, thats awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a brand new car from my dad, it is an expensive car and I love it. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, how amazing of your dad! We're you surprised?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, how amazing of your dad! We're you surprised? <endOfText>
<human> I was indeed surprised, I was not expecting it. I have always tried to be a good child. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago I ordered a custom birthday cake from somebody. The lady did incredible work on it. <endOfText>
<human> What type of cake was it. I love cake, wish I could have a slice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i trusted my friend with my credit card <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh.... I'm afraid to ask, how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hello how are you? <endOfText>
<human> I am great how are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm doing great. So I've got something I've got to get off my chest which isn't easy for me to speak about. <endOfText>
<human> Sure, vent whatever you need. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> LOL! Great guess! Yes I experimented a bit. Unfortunately it creates tension with my current relationship. <endOfText>
<human> Well, if you feel that's truly you be honest, and if they can't handle it find someone who can.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> If I am being honest, I was bummed when my brother got a full ride to college. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh most definitely, I am in a good place now, and so Is he, once I got older I knew it was a petty feeling. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. It seems like you've only gotten stronger and that's an important trait to develop in life. Be proud of what you can accomplish on your own and your independance! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son scored 2 goals in the football game. I was jumping and shouting his name. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Is he a starter? I bet you were super proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once a lady just randomly paid for my coffee as she was in line ahead of me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awesome, Was she paying it forward? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I believe so. She really made my day. <endOfText>
<human> It's always nice to get unexpected good surprises. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview a while ago that I worked hard for. <endOfText>
<human> You must've spent a while preparing. Did you get the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved across country recently and everything went exactly as planned for once. <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing! Where did you move to? Did you lose anything on the way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a teaching award last year for my work with at-risk youth. <endOfText>
<human> How commendable! Congratulations! That is a wonderful accomplishment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking bare feet outside and stepped on an earthworm. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gross! Did it feel slimy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes it did, It was not a nice feeling at all <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry! That would be unpleasant. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the rescue today. Huckleberry turned another corner.   He sat in my lap today.  We think he will go off meds soon <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to adopt him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last summer I stayed with a friend as I was nearly broke.  I went the store to get food and got back $20 extra in change from the cashier and ended up keeping the money. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, so it was extra money that was not yours? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope she didn't get in trouble for being short $20. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I thought about that. She was still working there weeks later so I was happy she wasn't fired. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Two weeks ago my neighbour got a brand new sports car! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that sounds super fun! What color? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I caught one of my friends doing something unforgivable. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Sounds rough.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 21-year old daughter recently moved out and she came back to visit! <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great!, was it a surprise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so glad i finished my meeting at work. i was so worked up about it. <endOfText>
<human> I bet it was way easier and less of a pain that you anticipated it would be. Are you ready for the rest of your work week now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I do a weird thing to cheer myself up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, like what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day i saw the craziest thing. <endOfText>
<human> What did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved across country while looking to my future life there. <endOfText>
<human> That's very brave. Did you run into any obstacles? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I once ordered something online, and was waiting for it for a long time. It was kind of fun to wait for it and look forward to it coming though.". <endOfText>
<human> It's always exciting when you know a package is on the way! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lives outside of city limits, but still only about 15 minutes from me. I told her that since recycling isn't available where she lives, she could bring hers to my house. <endOfText>
<human> That is thoughtful. Recycling is a great way to help the environment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I was really craving krystals after moving. <endOfText>
<human> The hamburger? Those can be tasty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad after selling my truck. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new dog! <endOfText>
<human> hey, that sounds wonderful. a puppy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went into a pizza shop a while back and saw something gross. <endOfText>
<human> What did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog did something horrible yesterday. :9 <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh, What did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the doctor for medical problems. <endOfText>
<human> How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend from childhood came into town last week and we made dinner plans. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that sounds like fun! Has it been a long time since you have seen him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the scariest experience the other night. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After a few years in the service industry i decided to go back to retail. Over the years I was away things had changed so much that i have to rely heavily on my trainer. <endOfText>
<human> Awww man, yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up, and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again, but I'm sure you can push through!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awww man, yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up, and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again, but I'm sure you can push through! <endOfText>
<human> Yes its kinda like riding a bike in some senses there are familiar parts. A few small differences and details that you have to make sure have been pointed out to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Dang, i messed up today. I spent the last 4 days cramming for this final, but still ended up having to guess on some of the questions on the test. <endOfText>
<human> Well hopefully the 4 days did good and hey guesses are 50-50 right. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah man! I'm hopeful that I can still pass haha. I'm just really glad that it's over and I can focus on other things now <endOfText>
<human> I think you did fine, even if you had to guess you probably made an educated guess, hopefully your subconscious remembered more.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an auction last week and saw this guy spend so much money! <endOfText>
<human> Did anyone try to bid against him?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did anyone try to bid against him? <endOfText>
<human> Yea some other guy but no one else. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I snuck out of bed the other night and ate someones food. <endOfText>
<human> Haha, did you eat some ice cream? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so lucky to be alive. i almost got in a horrible wreck the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Wrecks can be a scary thing to just miss. Was it the other persons fault? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Split second decisions save lives <endOfText>
<human> Sadly thats true. I just hope that person doesn't endanger others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think fondly of the Christmas I got my N64 . <endOfText>
<human> Thats cool. The N64 was a huge step up for enjoying your alone time for me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rode on my boyfriend's motorcycle for the first time on the highway and I was a little anxious about it <endOfText>
<human> Haha bikes can be very scary. Did you lean the wrong why, i did that my first time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This girl I know quit her job with me to follow her dreams. <endOfText>
<human> that was brave of her <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea, She became a body builder and goes to tournaments. <endOfText>
<human> wow, she must be really good. to quit herself.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so scared to attend my 5 year class reunion <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I feel so bad today. My grandmother past. <endOfText>
<human> Ohhh, I am sorry to hear that. I know your pain very well. Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my father died, so many people helped us and lended us support. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear about your father. That's so awesome to hear about the support you received, though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's funny you say that. There's so much going on right now, I wonder what the future holds. <endOfText>
<human> Anything you have in mind for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I decided to get another dog. I was nervous to tell his parents about it. <endOfText>
<human> Haha why is that? Do you already have too many? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt pretty sad the other day. my friend who i had plans with for the past month cancelled on me. <endOfText>
<human> Aw I hate when that happens. Did they have a valid excuse to cancel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I miss having coworkers to talk to, now that I work from home. <endOfText>
<human> Yea being alone can really get to someone head. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom can be really mean sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> My mom can too, What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to leave my dog behind when I moved. <endOfText>
<human> OH NO! Will he/she be ok? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I pulled out of my driveway during a horrendous rain storm and accidently ran over my neighbors cat <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! It isn't your fault!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had the worst experience eating out with friends. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you eat? And what happened? <endOfText>

<human> I hate when that happens. <endOfText>

<human> That is good that you feel better! What happened to change your perspective? <endOfText>

<human> im sorry, did you say anything to him"? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im excited my birthday is coming up and i know my wife is getting me something good <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun.  I'm sure she knows you well enough to get you something that will suit you well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember going to college out of state and being scared of the unknown since I would be so far away from familiar surrounding. <endOfText>
<human> i can imagine but it is good to get out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son and his wife are expecting their first child this fall. I am so excited and looking forward to being a grandmother. <endOfText>
<human> thats so awesome congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yep watched a guy do some tricks on a skateboard <endOfText>
<human> Was he any good or talented at it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month, my family and I drove to Colorado to visit my sister. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun how long has it been since you have seen her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so i did not get the promotion at work. they selected Steve to get it <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. You must be disappointed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks! Please wait while we match you up with another worker. (Sometimes this takes a few minutes if there aren't many other workers available <endOfText>
<human> Hello! How are you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A scammer called me on the phone today, he tried to get me to sign up for a service. <endOfText>
<human> oh no, were you polite to him? It can be pretty frustrating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt nostalgic the other day when I found a photo of my pet who died some time ago. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah i have a photo album and every time i look at it i smile <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was at a trivia contest and won! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting.  Was there a prize? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so happy with my fam <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. What do you like about your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The new school year has begun and I'm can't wait to see what the future has to offer <endOfText>
<human> awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, I'm a nursing major so I'm excited to begin volunteering at my local hospital. <endOfText>
<human> thats sounds fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my past successes was receiving an internship offer! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That's impressive, those can be really hard to get. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last Halloween, I went to a really scary haunted house. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What was scary about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i live alone work alone eat alone <endOfText>
<human> oh man. That is not good. Do you feel okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yea just need a friend <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry man. You can reach out to me anytime. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my girlfriend in a week, I'm feeling pretty alone at the moment. I need some quality time <endOfText>
<human>  i hear ya there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hear ya there <endOfText>
<human> yeah man just need some companionship. Good thing I got you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found the mug my grandfather used to use every day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is wonderful I know that means a lot to you. It has great sentimental value I am sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really brought back some great memories of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> I am sure it did and I know you will treasure that mug. Put it in a special safe place on display so you see it every day.. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister in law has it made in the shade. She has a new car, new house, shops all day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow. Good for her! Does she have a great job to afford such a great lifestyle? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm sure that much be hard to stand by and watch as someone who works hard for their things. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it is. I want to live that life. The hardest part of her day is scheduling hair, nail and tanning appointments <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently stopped at Sonic and got a carhop classic. It reminded me of when my Grandfather used to take me there as a kid. <endOfText>
<human> I love Sonic! I used to go as a kid a lot as well. They have the best shakes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i need to hear from a friend hes been ill <endOfText>
<human> That's an unfortunate situation. What's the diagnosis? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was late for work today and in a hurray I fell down some stairs <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible to hear, hopefully you didn't injure anything more than your pride. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bombed so bad on my first attempt at the SAT that i didn't talk for a week and paid 150 bucks for a prep course <endOfText>
<human> Wow im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i need to go to bed <endOfText>
<human> Are you tired, or do you have early plans tomorrow? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, that's exciting! There is nothing like relaxing on the porch in the evening. <endOfText>
<human> naw its for my birds <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago, I accidentally shoplifted a 12 pack of Coke from the store. <endOfText>
<human> oh myy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drove by the town i grew up in and made a few stops. it was a good time <endOfText>
<human> Sounds lovely! I bet it brought back a lot of memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we just found out my friends mom has cancer <endOfText>
<human> That's so unfortunate. My condolences. Is there anything you can do to help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A monkey jumped on my back and stole my banana! <endOfText>
<human> What did you do! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im so mad i fell <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are you okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last two cookies in the jar. I don't know if what I did was right. <endOfText>
<human> Well it should be ok and don't feel guilty. Two cookies are not that big of a deal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am up for a promotion at work. There are three other people up for it too but I am sure I will get it <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on getting that far! What position is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel kind of blue today. <endOfText>
<human> That's terrible, what's wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just told me their secret <endOfText>
<human> Is it a good one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nothing is going my way today. <endOfText>
<human> Why, what's wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I needed someone to watch my dogs last week <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to find someone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a child, my Mother and I took care of a garden allotment. I always think back on that time fondly, it was the best time of my life. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds so sweet, it's always nice to look back on fond times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I flirted with a married woman yesterday <endOfText>
<human> You're such a naughty person.  What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel really lucky even though I don't have much. <endOfText>
<human> What makes you feel lucky? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man i hate when family dies..:( <endOfText>
<human> Im guessing you must have had a family memeber die?   Im so sorry for your loss.    <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im guessing you must have had a family memeber die?   Im so sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, it seems my elders are on their last legs and i just lost my father. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope to save up enough money to run my own guest-house one day. I daydream about it all the time. <endOfText>
<human> Does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt like i can't buy a car. <endOfText>
<human> Why's that? Are you worried about driving? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw another woman looking at my boyfriend up and down while we are in line at the store <endOfText>
<human> Wow, I wonder if she knew that you two were together. Did she know that you saw her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the pound today and i felt like taking every animal home. <endOfText>
<human> I have been there, done that.  I used to be a dog groomer and I love dogs.   Its so sad to go the pound and see all the homeless dogs. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched a horror movie and I was afraid at night <endOfText>
<human> I'm such a scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies. What was the movie about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was feeling a little insecure so I decided to get a haircut and change my hair color a bit. I feel like a different person! <endOfText>
<human> wow. That is amazing, I love to change. What color did you choose?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to get dirty blonde highlights, just to add some dimension to my hair. I feel so beautiful now! <endOfText>
<human> Nice. I would like to do the same, but it is very expensive where I live. I hope I can afford it one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> wow. That is amazing, I love to change. What color did you choose? <endOfText>
<human> I decided to get dirty blonde highlights, just to add some dimension to my hair. I feel so beautiful now!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait to leave the country! im going on vacation soon! <endOfText>
<human> Woo! Where are you headed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I went to Venice, which I absolutely loved, but it was very crowded. I hear Florence is beautiful too! In Greece, I recommend Santorini, or Mykonos if you wanna party! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! Santorini here i come! lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Before Hurricane Irma last year, we quickly installed shutters, bought water, and bought shelf stable food just in time <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow where you in the area when it happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, and my family was too stubborn to evacuate, but I think the shutters kept us very safe <endOfText>
<human> Thank Jesus! lol I am glad you are OK. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its time for quarterly taxes but I feel good about it. I have been very diligent about recording keeping <endOfText>
<human> How did you accomplish this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a big rubbermaid portable file box that has folders <endOfText>
<human> Do you have some sort of method of organizing everything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I actually was able to keep my promise to this girl I was seeing? <endOfText>
<human> Well its always a good thing to keep a promise. Can I ask what the promise was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today when I picked my children up from school, I went the wrong way and almost got stuck. I had to turn around. I was ashamed. <endOfText>
<human> Ah its ok, we all amke mistakes. Are you in a new town? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did you move in a better home? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I did. Its much larger, and my children attend school on the same street.. its about a mile long <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my younger brother makes more money than i do. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least you dont have to worry about him begin ok in life. He can take care of himself, now. You can give him tips on making better choices with his money <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I got back from vacation, most of my garden was dead. My roommate promised me she would water it! <endOfText>
<human> I will go out on a limb and say she didn't hold up her end, hope you get your garden back bright and beautiful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Found a baby bird out of his nest in my front yard, even though I was afraid that the mother wouldn't take him back I helped him back in the nest <endOfText>
<human> Awwww.. what a heart warming moment. That was so sweet of you to do!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awwww.. what a heart warming moment. That was so sweet of you to do! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I love pets, got turtles running around loose most of the time when I am home <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my work issues laptop crashed and won't boot. But, I am hoping I can fix it myself, we all know sending it to IT takes forever! <endOfText>
<human> Good luck.  That sounds really frustrating.  Hope everything was backed up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a great time this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? Nice to hear. What exactly did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Years ago, I was trying to get pregnant. I took a pregnancy test. <endOfText>
<human> What happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Few years ago i was in shock when my dog died <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I'm so sorry. How did it happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my cat dead in the middle of the street. She was run over by a car. <endOfText>
<human> ooh, sorry to hear that, was it by itself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have recently started a business with my spouse. We knew it was going to work out! <endOfText>
<human> wow. Am happy for you, just commit to it and it will thrive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to watch a movie and sat behind a group of kids who talked the whole time. It was hard to enjoy the movie. <endOfText>
<human> did you tell them to stop speaking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was speeding when the police was behind me <endOfText>
<human> Oh, dear. did they pull you over? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The last 2 years I helped my mother get out of a bad relationship and brought her to live with me and my family thinking that it would help her move forward in life and enjoy it but come to find out it was a plot between her and my sister to push me entirly out of everyones lives in my <endOfText>
<human> oooh, thats so scary and bad of them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lived by myself during my twenties but didn't like it at all. The house was always empty. <endOfText>
<human> My friend and I were out at the bars one night, doing the usual young people thing. They had been acting off a little all night, and when I asked if they were okay, they told me everything was fine. I knew this wasn't true since I had known this person for years, but the night came to a close and we got a cab home.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend and I were out at the bars one night, doing the usual young people thing.

I knew this wasn't true since I had known this person for years, but the night came to a close and we got a cab home. <endOfText>
<human> Well, I'm glad it worked out well in the end. I on the other hand didn't have friends waiting for me home and felt kind of empty. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We rode in the cab, and my friend looks at me with the most serious face and tells me they are Bi-Sexual. Though they said they usually only date the same sex and they hadn't ever told anyone about it. <endOfText>
<human> Your friend must trust and care for you a lot to confide in you like that. how did you react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told them that it didn't matter to me, and I still loved them like family. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. you must have been surprised by the confession. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband went away for a weekend to celebrate his friend's bachelor party <endOfText>
<human> Wow! I hope he doesn't do anything too crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother recently lived , to start his life over he is finally liking the place , i have faith he will have a good future there <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's great. Were you able to help him move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really should have studied more for my math exam in college. I decided going out with friends would be more fun. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes going out with friends can relax the mind, who knows you might ace the test . <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I was having a hard time recently <endOfText>
<human> hello, why whats happened ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend told me a secret about his girlfriend and i didnt tell to anyone . He always tell me his secrets . <endOfText>
<human> What was the secret about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a microfracture in my knee that needed surgery to heal correctly. It wasn't fun thinking about the surgery but I liked my doctor well enough. <endOfText>
<human> I am really sorry to hear that.  How are you healing from it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just celebrated 25 years at my job. <endOfText>
<human> I mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party. It's pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hi, I just bought a new tv! <endOfText>
<human> thats great, are you enjoying it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month I had to give a speech in front of a lot of people. I was nervous when I first found out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I'm so socially awkward and anxious I'd never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandmother is sick and in the hospital. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am so sorry to hear that. :( I hope that she will be alright. Is it serious? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to be able to depend on others. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to stay with my current company even tho I was offered another job. <endOfText>
<human> It's nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you.  Is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It sure would be thoughtful if they did! I doubt it, but I still feel I made the right choice. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you choose to stay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am on a diet but I am having a hard time sticking to it. <endOfText>
<human> Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up! <endOfText>
<human> I won't but I am so desperate for good food.  I actually ate the leftover burger scraps off a plate at a restaurant the other day.  I am humiliated by it, but I really wanted a burger. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning out my bathtub drain this morning with bleach and hot water. My cat has never done this before but she jumped in and got covered in bleach and water. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my that must have been frightening! Poor little cat, what happened afterwards? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend Karl had a party, he invited a lot of people and I was not invited. I felt really bad. <endOfText>
<human> That sould make me feel sad. Did you talk to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate a small pizza to myself.... literally no self control! ugh <endOfText>
<human> I certainly know that feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im supposed to be eating healthier, and major failed this week. <endOfText>
<human> You can always improve that anytime you want to.  I have faith in you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took money from my brother's wallet to buy beer. <endOfText>
<human> Do you plan on paying him back quickly?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Do you plan on paying him back quickly? <endOfText>
<human> I might, but I feel really guilty about admitting it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to work as a flooring specialist at a major chain home improvement store. It was a good place to work until I got a new supervisor who thought he could disrespect me without consequences. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We got into several arguments and management decided to ignore  the problem and hope it would blow over. After a few weeks I turned in my resignation. <endOfText>
<human> Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again, I wish you had been treated so unkindly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had my own issues at work.  I was gossiping at work the other day with a coworker of mine. <endOfText>
<human> Something juicy I hope.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something juicy I hope. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah...just as I called the boss fat and lazy, she comes walking around the corner and hears me. I felt pretty vulnerable at that moment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i was putting some stuff in my attic and i noticed a terrible smell. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter borrowed my car the other day and you won't believe what happened. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The day finally came for me to move and to my surprise my family came over to help. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that's really great that they pitched in to help. You must be happy about that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made a deal with myself to work out more to get leaner. I've been so down on myself about it lately. <endOfText>
<human> Making moves to do better is all you can do.  How has it been going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got invited to speak at a conference, but I'm not sure I want to do it. <endOfText>
<human> What were you invited to speak about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take a test for work and didnt have time to study so i snuck notes in so i could get a high score. <endOfText>
<human> i hate to ask what happen, I imagine something went wrong <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> no i actually got promoted because of my high score, but i felt bad for cheating. <endOfText>
<human> that is the problem with cheating, you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious, all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I pretended not to hear a friend of mine when she was calling to me from down the road. <endOfText>
<human> Had she been bothering you recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grocery delivery was 2 hours late. They said they'd give me one discount but gave me two. I should probably tell them but I'm keeping them. <endOfText>
<human> What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they' <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well I kinda feel bad because they essentially gave me $40 off an $80 order. <endOfText>
<human> Oops, sorry, I didn't finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth $80.  Plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my school started back up this week. I was so ready to take on the year! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. It's wonderful to feel prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought my first new car last week. <endOfText>
<human> Congradulations.   You must be excited and proud.   Are you enjoying the new car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh no!  Hopefully you have full coverage? <endOfText>
<human> Luckily I was required to have it, but my insurance rates are going to go through the roof. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My fiance is having her bachelorette party. I'm excited for her. <endOfText>
<human> That is great!  When is the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last weekend at walmart the cashier gave me too much change, even though I noticed this i kept it <endOfText>
<human> How much did she give you over <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night i was running and a cat jumped out of this bush and almost gave me a heart attack <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like he startled you quite a bit, hope it wasn't a black cat. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had seven fishes in my aquarium, I came home from work one evening current went out and five fishes were dead. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. How did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Since this incident the have not spoken to me since. <endOfText>
<human> I have not seen the message about the incident but I do hope that person will speak to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally have enough money to quit my bad job. It has made me miserable for years. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry you had to go through all that stress. But yay for you being able to leave that situation! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lent my friend a thousand dollars recently. <endOfText>
<human> Do you trust your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if I should take the job offer I got today. <endOfText>
<human> Would it be a promotion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aliens came down the other day for the first time, and they wanted me to check out the inside of their spaceship! <endOfText>
<human> That is a pretty weird thing to have happen <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am on a diet and last night i cheated.. <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like somebody needs an accountabili-buddy... <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the mall with my friends. I had my purse and someone hit me on the shoulder causing my purse to slip off my shoulder unto the ground. He did not apologise <endOfText>
<human> That is not ok to do. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the fair is in ton and i took my son you shouuld have seen his facve <endOfText>
<human> He must have been very excited! That is awesome. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was caught drunk driving last night on my way home from the bar. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did they take you to jail? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes. I am so ashamed of myself but glad I did not hurt anyone. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I wouldn't feel to good about myself either but at least no one got hurt including yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my brother for ten years before he came to visit me in January. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, it must have been an exciting time for you seeing your brother after such a long time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned a friend some money believing they would pay me back in a week. I have not heard from them since. <endOfText>
<human> you should go to their place <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All day at work my coworkers would laugh when I'd pass by. I had no idea what was going on until I got home and noticed I had a giant candy stuck in the back of my hair! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  They are mean to not have told you.  I would've told you.  How did it even get there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going for an interview for a job on Monday and am feeling nauseated when I think about it. <endOfText>
<human> Hey, I bet you'll do great! Nothing to stress about.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Hey, I bet you'll do great! Nothing to stress about. <endOfText>
<human> I just really want this job more than any others and its hard to get in.  I'll be crushed if I don't get it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've trying for years to get a great deal on a pizza oven at home. I finally was able to secure a real brick oven for cheap! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, you must really be excited. Do you have room for it in your kitchen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found the baby book I made for my baby when she was born... she just turned 21. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations on the good raising of the kid! I bet you were just flooded with all kinds of memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got to visit with some of my old high school friends a few weeks ago. It's hard to believe it's been over thirty years since we first met. <endOfText>
<human> I bet that was nice though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, there's only one of them I really keep up with. I'll probably never see the other two again. <endOfText>
<human> Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My puppy fell off the couch and hurt his paw. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what happened next, is he alright? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a hard time choosing which phone to get. I ended up getting a new phone with all the specs. <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  What did you end up with? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember playing catch with my dad. <endOfText>
<human> You must be very fond of such memories. Do they make you feel nostalgic? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my son drive the car for the first time. I felt he was ready. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, he did he do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to up my average amount i can bench press the other day! <endOfText>
<human> What am amazing feeling that must be!  Did it take you a long time?  Must have felt so satisfying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow we celebrate my daughters 16th birthday. I can remember when she was 6 and obsessed with unicorns. Time moves so quickly. <endOfText>
<human> I agree! Is she excited? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't get myself to sell my grandpa's old Cadillac. <endOfText>
<human> Feeling sentimental much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet snake died <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. I hope you're not feeling too sad.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had him for 18 years. <endOfText>
<human> I had no idea snakes even lived that long. I am sure he was a faithful buddy to you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that. I hope you're not feeling too sad. <endOfText>
<human> I had him for 18 years.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So , my step daughter just bought a brand new car. wondering what the heck am I doin wrong here. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe its time to find a new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found the baby braclet they put on my father when he was born at the hospital. <endOfText>
<human> oh my goodness. Thats so cool. who did you show it to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a bad headache this morning. I had coffee delivered and was so thankful for it. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't seen my boyfriend in about a week. <endOfText>
<human> Why not? Is everything okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well it is always like this, we spend one week together and one apart, so he has time to be with his kids. <endOfText>
<human> That must be somewhat frustrating at times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to put my ferret to sleep last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is awful. The loss of a pet is just the worst <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust in my brothers, they very rarely let me down <endOfText>
<human> It is good to have people you can count on. If you can't trust your family, who can you trust? :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took some copy paper from work today and got caught. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get chewed out too badly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just had a house fire one month ago. We lost most of our things and our dog, Pudges. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, it must be absolutely devastating. But you must stay strong. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got an email today that my dream college just rescinded my admission offer. <endOfText>
<human> What? Oh no! Can they do that?  I would fight it and see what happened.  You must feel sick. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cats for the most part are angels, but they've absolutely destroyed a very nice sofa bed my grandmother left me when she passed. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I take they still got their claws. mine is the same way but there is one piece of furniture he just insists on ruining. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Have you ever gone to an open mic night? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I've gone a few times actually. Do you like them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so bad about breaking my moms picture display, it was very elaborate and nice <endOfText>
<human> Oops! Do you think that you can replace it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister let me take care of her dog whilst she was away. I really enjoyed taking care of him. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you to do. What kind of dog does she have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wrote a 20 page paper for a class. I walked away from the computer for a second and when I returned I had lost all of my work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, do you have a draft saved. Or was that the only copy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I put in a bid to purchase my first home! <endOfText>
<human> That's amazing!  Did you get i? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I take my family to the local soup kitchen to volunteer a couple saturdays a month and we really enjoy helping. <endOfText>
<human> That's really great. You're setting a good example for your kids, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> For the first time in my life I am financially secure, have my own home, and a new car. <endOfText>
<human> That is a good place to be.  Are you happy with your job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just had our third kid and I think I'm good with just these three. <endOfText>
<human> Yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yep more than that and you will need a big house and lots of toys! <endOfText>
<human> I already have all that, but three seems to be just perfect.  I love these little ones. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my Tesla drive on autopilot for four miles yesterday! <endOfText>
<human> Really? That must be fun <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up this morning and saw a scratch on my car, I have no idea how it got there. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh do you have any security camera that might have captured what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Unfortunately not. I know it is going to cost a lot to fix it. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so too. Its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so too. Its really annoying when that happens and just ruins your day. <endOfText>
<human> Yes it does, it totally ruin my day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for my test. I studied for 5 hours striaght. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do very well! What subject? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When we moved, my grandfather gave me a lamp as a gift.  He attached a cut out of a spider to the inside of the shade. <endOfText>
<human> Haha! That definitely must have scared many people that did not know what it was. That must be hilarious to watch! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband was sick with a really bad cold a few weeks ago. I tended to him to make him comfortable while he got better. <endOfText>
<human> And you know when men get sick, they're on their death bed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> LOL!!! Yup! But seriously, I was happy to do it for him. He always does the same for me when I am sick. <endOfText>
<human> And you know when men get sick, they act like they are dying. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had always thought I could have faith in my mom to help me out when things when tough but I was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry about that. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, that stinks. Hopefully she will be there for you next time if you ever need help again. <endOfText>
<human> She's very unreliable so I'm not holding my breath! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my mother recently, she was sick with hypertension and diabetics <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really excited about this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! What are your plans for this weekend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Several years ago I got to be on a game show! I hoped to win a lot of money. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! What show? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 10 year old cat is starting to get sick a lot. I'm worried about her. <endOfText>
<human> Has she had a history of illness? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is watching over some possessions of mine while I leave for a trip. There's some expensive exercise equipment he has to look after. <endOfText>
<human> I have some of that too. It would make me a little nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was not at all patient with my little brother. <endOfText>
<human> Really? Why you should have been patient. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got one thousand dollars from my father for my birthday. <endOfText>
<human> WOW! That is really cool! What will you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have not figured it out as yet <endOfText>
<human> Have fun spending it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I still remember when I used to wait tables back in college and dropped the plates when serving an important patron. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been embarrassing, wasnt it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was ashamed when I broke my moms vase. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a prestigious or expensive vase? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview coming up! I'm nervous, but I think I'm ready! <endOfText>
<human> Great, since you are prepared I'm sure you will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a wonderful family and my health that has been horrible, is finally turning around with my hard work. I am happy with life. <endOfText>
<human> I am so glad to hear everything is going well for you!. It is good to hear your health is improving. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister fell ill a few weeks ago. I went to her house to take care of her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Is she okay? That is so great that she has you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Earlier a phd student posted he wanted to talk to someone on a fb online forum , i did he sounded like a nice kid , he promised to pay me , i trusted him <endOfText>
<human> That's good that you trusted him. Sometimes I miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> These days I'm trusting my intuition and following my gut to achieve my goals.  They've gotten me this far and haven't let me down yet <endOfText>
<human> your intuition seems to be trustful and the right way to go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had a group meeting at work and there was some leftover pizza. While everyone was getting ready to leave and they weren't looking, I snuck the rest of the leftover pizza in my purse and slid out! <endOfText>
<human> haha... you little thief! (joking) That must have been some good pizza! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, is it wrong to not want your child to join a sport because you just don't want to have to take them to practices? <endOfText>
<human> Haha! No! It's not wrong! My son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ballfields! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently visited my hometown after being away for 20 years! <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really late to work the other day, and my car was running on fumes. <endOfText>
<human> That would really stress me out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors left their trash in the hallways. It is attracting flies. <endOfText>
<human> Oh they need to take care of that asap! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing a presentation at work and in the middle of it my computer crashed! I couldnt believe it! <endOfText>
<human> That awful!  Were you able to continue without it?  That must have really messed up your rhythm. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my friends was telling me to not include my best friend in a movie night. I told her if I couldn't invite her then I wasn't going to go either. <endOfText>
<human> You are a good friend. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> me and my mom have been feeling blue , ever since my brother moved far away <endOfText>
<human> Why did he move so far away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally broke a vase at my moms house on sunday. <endOfText>
<human> i hope your mom can understand , it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hope your mom can understand , it was an accident and everyone makes mistakes <endOfText>
<human> I haven't told her yet, she didn't notice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went back to my old neighborhood to see friends and it was a crazy feeling. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a good feeling or a bad feeling? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started working out again after almost 20 years and I was very nervous at first. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, that's a long break. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> August is coming to an end. I always go back to my childhood when the last week before school starts were some of the most exciting times of my young life. <endOfText>
<human> What did you get up to in August usually? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just avoided cheating on my girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa that's out of left field, how'd that happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just got a new rabbit as a pet! <endOfText>
<human> Aww, so cute! I bet your having such a fun time with him/her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "Last weekend, I slipped on some wet grass and slid, hand first, into a pile of dog poop. In front of everyone at a BBQ. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! How gross! That must have been so embarrassing! Were you able to clean yourself up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't have much more money to keep living as a college student. But I just have one more year left. After that, hopefully things stabilize. <endOfText>
<human> It's great that you only have one more year left! What are you getting a degree in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Is it wrong to be jealous of your best friend? <endOfText>
<human> I think it's just human nature. Even if it were wrong, there may be nothing you can do about it. But I think there are ways you can take your negative emotions and put a positive spin on them, in order to motivate you in a more healthy, conducive way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's true. She just sold her book to a publisher and it is just a little weird. <endOfText>
<human> I could see that... Yeah. Well, I hope you are able to re-invest that energy into your own passions. I think you could do a lot for yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I've been having a problem lately. <endOfText>
<human> Ok, and do you want to share this problem? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad got my brother a watch but not me. <endOfText>
<human> Did you want a watch? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's friday. I'm going to go home and grill a steak and have a beer. <endOfText>
<human> It's your right as an American citizen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stepped into my Ferrari F-40 the other day, and I shed a tear. <endOfText>
<human> Is it your first ferrari? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor asked me out on a date, even  though he knows I am married. I told him no. <endOfText>
<human> What did he say in response? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was quite an experience flying for the  first time. <endOfText>
<human> I can just imagine, it must have been exciting for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every single person I know got to go on a vacation this year except for me. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there a reason why you couldn't? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing my garage burn was insane. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that is terrible! I hope you and your family evacuated safely. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally left the screen door cracked open and my beagle got out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Were you able to find him/her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read an article the other day about a noble politician. he gave his salary to charity! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that's cool.  And surprising haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to try sushi at some point soon. <endOfText>
<human> I love sushi its delicious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my mom shes really nice and helpful <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure she is a lovely woman. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine got first place in her age category in a triathlon! <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting news! You must be so happy for her! Are you going out to celebrate? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a fresh haircut, shaved my beard, and a new suit for my date! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you have a good time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a Cobb salad for lunch earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Hm sounds like a healthy choice! Do you feel good about yourself now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a job that pays very well. I have money for everything that I need. <endOfText>
<human> Good.  Money, while important, is certainly not everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I forgot to put on my e-brake in my car the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How did that work out for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been practicing driving all week for my driver exam. I think I am ready! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you will ace it! what kind of car are you taking the exam in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looked up the recipe and went shopping and have everything I need! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what will you be cooking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Five is a great number, but six is even better. It's my favorite number, don't know why either! <endOfText>
<human> oops!  sorry about that.  I want to tell you that I have been taking guitar lessons for almost a year now and will be playing in my first recital. I've got my song down perfectly so I know I'll do great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mother was sick for a time, but she is now doing great, <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad to hear she is doing well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, thank god! <endOfText>
<human> I hope you both stay healthy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally spilled soup all over myself at the restaurant. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  what a bother,  were you able to clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was rough comforting my friend when she left her boyfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that would be tough! Were they together for a long time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel so let down. I applied for a job, but didn't get it. <endOfText>
<human> What happened? How come you didnt get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate wants to get a cat. But he's already irresponsible enough as it is, and can't clean up after himself. How can he clean up after a cat, too? But I don't want to be the person to say no.. <endOfText>
<human> I think you will need to tell him how you feel about this. Otherwise you may end up taking more care of the cat than him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My company just got a huge order from a Fortune 500! <endOfText>
<human> I'm not 100% sure what that means, but that sounds exciting, especially if you're excited about it. Congratulations! Hopefully that means you guys will just keep getting bigger and bigger.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not 100% sure what that means, but that sounds exciting, especially if you're excited about it. Congratulations! Hopefully that means you guys will just keep getting bigger and bigger. <endOfText>
<human> Yep. It means we are anticipating a lot of work and a lot of money. So pay raises for everyone! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today I am alone in the house, since everybody had something to do. <endOfText>
<human> Do you enjoy your alone time or do you wish you had people around? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out that I got every question on my last exam correct! I am super happy! <endOfText>
<human> hey that's awesome man I'm proud of you, was it hard? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i missed my period, took a pregnancy test, and it's positive. I am not doing okay <endOfText>
<human> How far along do you think you are? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was crossing the street the other day. As I was crossing, I tripped and fell to the ground. <endOfText>
<human> That must have hurt, did you get injured? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in no hurry to move out of my parents house. <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you. I would be trying to avoid bills too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally get to go on vacation for the first time in 5 years! Only 7 more days away! <endOfText>
<human> im excited for you! where are you goin? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A good friend of mine is moving to another city in the other side of the country. <endOfText>
<human> What city are they moving to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been faithful to my girlfriend of almost 3 years now <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear that,  I hope you continue to be faithful to her in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told all my friends that I bought my Ferrari F-40 all by myself. <endOfText>
<human> Did you buy it all by yourself? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend took me skiing, it was actually my first time skiing. <endOfText>
<human> Did you fall a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a hanuted house ans severely underestimated how scary they are. <endOfText>
<human> I love haunted houses! Did you go alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend came over while I was on a trip and trashed my apartment, took things too. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh you need to tell him to return those things and tidy up the house.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh you need to tell him to return those things and tidy up the house. <endOfText>
<human> He denied doing it. Said he was like that when he got there and he tried to clean up. The only other person who had keys to my place was with me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked through an old neighborhood with my son and was hit by a wave old memories. <endOfText>
<human> Was a neighborhood you frequented? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched my daughter start high school this week <endOfText>
<human> How did that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear of your grandmother's passing. My condolences to you and your family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A dear friend of mine passed away last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm so sorry. Was it unexpected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While I was cooking, my 4 year old got into these paint markers and drew/painted all over himself and the furniture in his room. I didn't know whether to scream or cry. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Those little ones seem to do stuff like that all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cleaning up and found some old photographs of myself as a child today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool. I love looking through my old photos. makes me feel warm and fuzzy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was roasting a chicken in the oven and forgot to put the timer on. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did it burn? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My entire family was able to make it to our reunion. I was so happy to see them <endOfText>
<human> That must of been fun, where did you meet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my math exam. I am an idiot. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible. Is there anyway to redo it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been slaving away in the kitchen all day and my in-laws are about to arrive. I have falafel wraps with tzaitziki and tahini dressing and a couple sides. I'm ready! <endOfText>
<human> that sounds amazing, I hope they enjoy it a lot! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so too!  We love it and its all homemade. <endOfText>
<human> It sounds like it will, i hope you have  a great dinner! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my girlfriend a lot, we have been dating for almost 3 years now! <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful!  Are you thinking of proposing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad at my bank. they somehow thought to charge me for a credit card i didn't want. <endOfText>
<human> That is not good. Did they give you back your money?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is not good. Did they give you back your money? <endOfText>
<human> Yes but i had to spend a whole hour on the phone explaining why they were at fault. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am thinking about looking for a new job. <endOfText>
<human> Why? Are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Recently I was looking to buy a car and even when I am not in the market anymore, sales people keep calling me everyday <endOfText>
<human> I have had that happen before and it is super annoying! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love video games , i used to love going to the arcades i would rack so many wins , and usually bummed when i would lose , ah the good old days <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun!  The arcades were always kind of noisy for me though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go back to work soon after being off on maternity leave. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's so hard! How are you feeling about it? Itching to go back, or dreading it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son had an ingrown toenail so I took him to the podiatrist today. It was pretty gross! <endOfText>
<human> Ouch! What did they do for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my job interview coming up has me pretty nervous. I keep thinking about it. <endOfText>
<human> That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the doctor on Monday. <endOfText>
<human> That is smart of you. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My old cat is very sick and we have to put her down next week. <endOfText>
<human> that is so sad to hear, it must be tough for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out on a bachelor party with my friends. A girl wanted my number but I told her I already have a great girl at home. <endOfText>
<human> Good job! Hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom can be a little too persistent about things she doesn't know much about. <endOfText>
<human> Its possible she is just trying to be helpful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew took me riding with him after he got his drivers license. I had to believe that he would keep us safe. <endOfText>
<human> Did he live up to the belief? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My nephew just started talking full sentences! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to graduate today after 4 years of school! <endOfText>
<human> That is great! Congrats! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister's husband is going out of town for the weekend and she hates being alone. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, will you be able to keep her company? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just learned that my niece was invited to the honor program in her new high school <endOfText>
<human> Aw, nice! That's kind of cool, actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff, so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... "feel good" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock, either. I told him to not come in, and he just kept coming in! <endOfText>
<human> I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom just texted me a picture of her and I when I was really young. I'm on the other side of the country right now, and it made me miss her badly. Wish there was a way I had money to surprise visit her. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a friends house and he had the grossest kitchen i had ever seen! <endOfText>
<human> I feel like this is me. I'm clean, but I'm stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn't do dishes. And I also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with. Sorry you have to deal with that, because I know I hate living in it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got lost in a bad part of town <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That can be very scary! Did you make it out ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Isaw the most amazing sports play yesterday! I was shocked. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really, what was the play? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in a really awkward position. My best friend is cheating on his girlfriend, and my own girlfriend is telling me I need to speak up and reveal his secret. No idea what to do, and I'm disappointed in my friend, too. <endOfText>
<human> That's horrible. I'd talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> College football officially starts tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Whoop Whoop! Thanks for reminding me. I have to purchase youtube live for it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family threw a suprise get together for me! <endOfText>
<human> That must have been so fun! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been feeling a little nervous about getting into grad school. <endOfText>
<human> I guarantee that you will be fine! I graduated with a master's last year <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> After many years of depression, it looks like I am beginning to get better. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful news. I have also battled depression and am feeling better now. That  is a real big deal. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter came to visit today. We had a really nice day. <endOfText>
<human> Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit. <endOfText>
<human> Yes. I brought out the old photo album and we looked through and talked about the old days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband's been out of town this week, and will be gone for another week. <endOfText>
<human> Do you miss him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son informed me today that he was charged with possession of drugs <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's terrible.  Is he in legal trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I suppose so. This is not how I taught to be and am so disappointed he has done this. <endOfText>
<human> This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son will be turning 2 in a few months, and I am a little sad about it. <endOfText>
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rented out my bedroom to Airbnb customers and when I returned it was left smelly and diapers every where. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So jealous of my buddy. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that, might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was able to negotiate the rent of my apartment back down to a better rate, after they had raised it for the new year. I was kind of worried I'd have to find a new place, but now I don't have to move anything and go through that annoying process <endOfText>
<human> That's very lucky of you, what do you plan on doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm nervous about this test I did. <endOfText>
<human> Don't be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss my aunt. I am a bit of a loner and she was the one i always talked to. I had to move far away from her recently. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been considering adopting a cat, but I already have three dogs and I'm a bit afraid they won't take a liking to a new animal, much less a cat. <endOfText>
<human> Yea that can be tough. What kind of dogs? Are they easy to train? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My college entrance exam is tomorrow and I can't stop thinking I will fail. <endOfText>
<human> I can understand the anxiety, I'm sure you'll do fine though! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thanks. I hope I can at least get some sleep so that I cam fresh in the morning. <endOfText>
<human> Sleep is so important before an exam, that's where all your facts and memories get better organized <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "I was thinking about going camping, but I'm worried about the weather ruining it. <endOfText>
<human> Is it possible to re-arrange the date to when the weather would be more favorable? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been working on training my puppy. He just started to grasp sitting. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice!! What kind of treats are you using? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man.....my cat died:( I feel horrible. <endOfText>
<human> That's awful, how did your cat die? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling pretty good about this upcoming math exam. <endOfText>
<human> That's good! Do you usually like math? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone had to walk into the bathroom after I had used it and made it smell really badly. As I was leaving, they made a comment about how bad it smelled, and I couldn't help but cringe <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that, it is pretty embarassing to be in situations like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am happy with my life right now, everything is going well <endOfText>
<human> It's good to hear someone doing well for once. Most people are usually only up for complaining and seeing the negatives in things. I don't want to be too nosey, but can you tell me why you're feeling good about things lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a strange shadow in the kitchen at night and froze in fear! <endOfText>
<human> Wow I bet you were terrified! Did you see again after or just that once. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just the once. I couldnt even sleep the whole night thinking it was a ghost! <endOfText>
<human> I bet, I wouldn't be able to sleep after either. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog is getting on my nerves. he never shuts up. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. What is he barking at? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got new neighbors recently. I wanted to do something nice so I baked a meatloaf for them. The problem is it smelled so good I had to try it first. <endOfText>
<human> Haha that's not a problem! You must be a good cook! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked really hard for a promotion at work and I ended up not getting it. <endOfText>
<human> That is a shame! I'm sorry to hear that. If you really like you job then just keep working hard. I am sure they will recognize your efforts pretty soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed caring for patients in the Emergency Room while working at my previous job. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Are you a nurse? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so into that guy. I thought he was really attractive. <endOfText>
<human> Is there any chance for something to happen? Seems like you developed a connection from afar, if he's still on your mind. Why do you think there's no chance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend has been acting suspicious lately. Guarding her phone, being absent here and there when she didn't used to be. Having weird excuses for her weird behavior. She tells me nothing is going on, and I try to believe her. I don't know how much longer that will last. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. It can be hard to be in a situation where you think the other person is cheating. Is there any other reason she might be acting suspicious? Have you talked to her about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sad as a kid when my pants fell down in class, everyone laughed at me <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, that is pretty embarrassing! But just imagine if you watched that happen to someone else. You would probably be laughing too. Lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so appreciative to be able to be open and honest with my husband and to be able to have an amazing relationship <endOfText>
<human> I agree! I'm in a long distance relationship, but we've developed so much trust over the 7 years we've been together that I never worry about what she's doing or who she's with, and neither does she worry about me. We've slowly built up our communication over the years. I'm glad to hear that you have the same thing in yours. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Mentioned my company on social media the other day. Now I'm getting told I have to meet with management after the weekend for something they can't talk about until then. I'm not sure how they could know about what I said, but I have no idea what else it could be, and I'm nervous. <endOfText>
<human> try not to stress out about it all weekend. if you didn't do anything wrong nothing bad will happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So upset at my brother for trying to fight me <endOfText>
<human> Brothers always seem to want to get into fights with one another, but at the end of the day, I'm sure you guys love each other very much! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my kids became adults, I gave away all their old toys. Or so I thought... Today I found one of my daughter's old dolls. It brought back so many memories I don't think I can get rid of it. <endOfText>
<human> What made you give them all away? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, I donated them to charity for kids who don't have much. <endOfText>
<human> That is very kind of you, how old is your daughter now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Luckily the braves are doing good this season, the past few years have been tough. <endOfText>
<human> They are looking pretty good this year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now! <endOfText>
<human> thats great! how come? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> In university, for my major of social work, we all get mandatory internships where they place us in certain ones and we have no control over it. Some other students received cool internship placements, and I feel like mine doesn't compare. Kind of disappointed I didn't get something more interesting <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. At least you can use the experience with your current internship to get you to another place you want to go! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is returning from his tour after ten years on Sunday! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome! where has he been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am excited about the direction our country is finally going, hopefully it continues this path <endOfText>
<human> Nice! And what country might that be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met up with my best friend in high school for the first time in 15 years. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool! That is a long time! Was he the same as he used to be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always wanted a ferrari for everyday of the week. <endOfText>
<human> That's a lofty goal, but if you work hard maybe you can achieve it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw some kids playing with airsoft guns, it reminded me of my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> Did you go buy a thousand dollar rig and show em who's boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty excited to get my letter. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of letter? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was building a sculpture outside and some neighborhood kid threw a baseball and destroyed it. <endOfText>
<human> You must have been devestated! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate promised he'd be good with cleaning up after his cat when he asked if he could get one. Now he's hardly ever cleaning the litter box. It's getting old really fast. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh.  I've heard that plenty of times only to see very similar results.  Time for the cat to move out I think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big surprise party planned for my friend tonight. <endOfText>
<human> You sound like a good friend, going through the effort and trouble to fix that up. I'm not into surprises, but I'm sure you know your friend well enough to know that he'd like it if you gave him one. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really dont mind when my girlfriends goes out on a girls night. <endOfText>
<human> i'm the same way with my wife, i trust her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the chargers have the roster to be great this season, but we are having so many preseason injuries <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. You always have to have faith in your team. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my anniversary, my spouse bought me flowers and gifts. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is so sweet.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh that is so sweet. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I love flowers, I wouldn't mind getting flowers everyday. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About 5 years ago, I went to a swimming pool. In the showers, some kids made fun of my body. I felt bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> kids can be so hurtful, be happy about who you are! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am gunna be so bummed if the braves dont make a run this year! <endOfText>
<human> Who are the braves? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been getting ready for grad school and I am feeling a little anxious about it. <endOfText>
<human> It can be pretty scary getting ready for a new environment. but i am sure after the first day it will be gone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a horrible experience with someone who had a horrible case of road rage. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy to be back in Chicago on vacation. It's my hometown. <endOfText>
<human> I love going back to my hometown. Its a good feeling being back. What are you most excited about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big interview next week and I am so nervous. Im not sure if I should just cancel or not. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Why would you cancel? Is it a good opportunity? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son is growing up so fast, its bittersweet i miss my boy being little! <endOfText>
<human> I understand. They are so cute when they are toddler. How old he is now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very worried because I am waiting for a blood test results. <endOfText>
<human> that is scary! what is the problem? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker got the job promotion that I had been working so hard to get. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I have had that happen. It did not feel good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was given a huge discount on my groceries today. I definitely was not expecting it. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! Groceries can be expensive, so that was a blessing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My aunt graduated college! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! Congratulations to your aunt! What did she major in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my grandmother is having surgery this week, im going to stay with her at least one night <endOfText>
<human> What kind of surgery is she having? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend managed to do a cartwheel in front of me. I didn't think he could do it anymore. <endOfText>
<human> haha that's pretty cool. Is he a gymnasist? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is going to try and drive up to see me next month. Fingers crossed, he'll be able to make the trip. <endOfText>
<human> that is cool, you must be really anticipating this visit <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it's been a couple of years since I've seen him in person. <endOfText>
<human> i bet both of you will have a blast together, don't have too much fun ;) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love spending time with my family. I love them so much. <endOfText>
<human> That's so sweet! I love my family too! What are some things you like to do together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm supposed to hear in the next day or two whether I've gotten my dream job! I can't wait to find out! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. I hope you get it. What is the job title? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at a party and puked on the porch <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  That's a terrible feeling.  Did you go home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just retired in the spring after 40 years at the same job <endOfText>
<human> thats great! congrats on retirement! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Everything is going great right now. <endOfText>
<human> That is good news! My life is also going great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my husband and i have such a great relationship i am so thankful for it! <endOfText>

<human> thank you! are you married? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a wrangler today and want one so bad <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i think the braves are going to make a run this yea <endOfText>
<human> i do too! they are very talented! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> the chargers are set up for a great season! <endOfText>
<human> I agree, are you looking forward to them winning some silverware? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My Tesla is able to drive by itself! It blew me away with all the sophistication. <endOfText>
<human> I am so jealous! So i am guessing it was worth the price? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my fantasy football draft is tomorrow, i am looking to win it all for the third time! <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful. i do hope that you will win <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am going to be so happy this weekend not to have a million things to do and binge watch a show, lol. <endOfText>
<human> Ahh.. I'm jealous. That sounds relaxing! What do you normally do that keeps you so busy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldn't believe that I received an A on my final that I didn't even study for <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Congrats.  Which class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Maybe, could be! Aw, what subjects did you like? <endOfText>
<human> I loved history but couldn't really get a great job with that!  Exact opposite of what you are doing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oof, that's funny because I was awful at history! <endOfText>
<human> figures, right?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I said a little prayer before lunch yesterday, which is something I almost never do! <endOfText>
<human> is something wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not really, I just felt really grateful to be alive and well. <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome! i hope that feeling continues! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a fantasy football draft tomorrow, I think all of my research will benefit me! <endOfText>
<human> You must feel prepared now since you've done all your planning and analysis.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You must feel prepared now since you've done all your planning and analysis. <endOfText>
<human> I am! I would like to win the league this year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it makes me so mad when i see of someone hurting children! <endOfText>
<human> It would certainly make me furious if I witnessed that. Have you witnessed such an act recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big certification test coming up this week for my new job. I have been studying a lot but am feel unprepared. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you'll do fine. You are probably just nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family is awesome. I believe they will never hurt me. <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear it. You are lucky to have such an amazing family. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been providing help and support for a friend that has lost his mon recently. <endOfText>
<human> That <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was dog-sitting for my friend. Two little Chihuahuas! <endOfText>
<human> That is cute. How old are they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my science class. :9 <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks! How are you feeling about that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a movie recently that I haven't watched since I was 8 <endOfText>
<human> What movie was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think our country is heading in the right direction, definitely better than it has been the past 8 years! <endOfText>
<human> Finally, someone that sees it! Everyone around me disagrees but I have hope.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Finally, someone that sees it! Everyone around me disagrees but I have hope. <endOfText>
<human> I do too! We are in so much better shape than we have been and its great <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it makes me very mad when i see or hear of someone hurting children <endOfText>
<human> I'd be furious if I witnessed such a thing too. Have you witnessed such an act like that lately? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so mortified yesterday.  I slipped and fell in the parking lot in a spectacular fashion. <endOfText>
<human> Haha. Sorry to laugh but you said it in a funny way. Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to fly the other day and i was so scared. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I am sorry!  Did it turn out OK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i really wanted to hit the lottery when it was over 500 million! <endOfText>
<human> What would you have done with the money? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told all my friends that I was gonna bring by my new v12 bugatti veyron to their party. <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow, that is a bad to the bone car! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my Girlfriend randomly baked me a cake last night and it was super good <endOfText>
<human> Surprise cake is the best.  What flavor was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was at summer camp I was wearing sweat pants and someone shanked me! <endOfText>
<human> Wait what does that mean what i think it means? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Probably, someone pulled down my pants during dinner at the mess hall...humiliating. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the children's hospital to bring gifts for children who are sick. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that is so nice of you, I bet they really appreciated it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not a whole lot you can do besides make their day a little better which you have already done. They're in there to heal or get better hopefully. <endOfText>
<human> That is so true. I wish they could all get better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma is having surgery this week, I'm nervous for her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I'm so sorry. I hope she'll be okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so too! It is the second time she is having the procedure <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure her doctors will do a good job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Back when I was in high school, I studied very hard for the SATs. <endOfText>
<human> How did you do when you took them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate seeing anything about people hurting children <endOfText>
<human> I hear you. Sometimes the realities and brutal nature of the world is hard to learn and know about. Almost makes you want to be ignorant to it all. Did you recently encounter this? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> "My roommate promised he'd clean up his half of the apartment while I was away on vacation. I come back to the same old, same old. Dirty, smelly, and uninhabitable. Wish I didn't have to be stuck with him for another year. <endOfText>
<human> I feel for you! Bad roommates are the worst <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just started my freshman year in college and have no friends. <endOfText>
<human> It's always an intimidating atmosphere! Have you tried joining any clubs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea I joined many clubs but haven't really hit it off with anyone yet. I just feel so lonely and miss my parents. <endOfText>
<human> Right! Well I'd say try to get to know a few people really well that have common interests! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog died recently. I'm sad he's gone! <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Remember he will always be with you in your heart.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that. Remember he will always be with you in your heart. <endOfText>
<human> Of course! There are always memories! Have you ever had a pet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wanted to live in the house that tom brady had with giselle in massachusets. <endOfText>
<human> that sounds quite cool, did you not get the house <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh of course I did! I was so psyched when I saw it was on the market for only 13 mil! <endOfText>
<human> wow what a steal <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got caught cheating once in school 3 years ago <endOfText>
<human> Were you sent to detenton? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My taxi came late and I missed my board meeting yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> That is horrible! Did you get into trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There have been many attempted abductions near me lately, its scary <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is terrifying. Do the police know about this? They oughta increase security.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that is terrifying. Do the police know about this? They oughta increase security. <endOfText>
<human> They do, and they are trying to catch these people. Its sad there are people like that, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am satisfied this week, I have delivered a good project on time. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! For school or work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my husbands leftovers while he was taking a nap. <endOfText>
<human> Did he say anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A mosquito has been flying around my head all night and I have been able to kill it! <endOfText>
<human> Okay so you need a can of hairspray <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How will that help? Honestly I am so annoyed right now, I'll do anything to make it go away. <endOfText>
<human> Well the alcohol in it will paralyze it enough for you to be able to kill it!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this one time that me and my mom went to targets black friday sale, and waited outside for like 7 hours in order to get 3 huge flat screen TVs, just to realize that they wont all fit in the car. The people in the car next to us also had a bunch of things including a TV and offered to follow and drop it off. At first I was worried but they came and dropped it off, they were just nice people. <endOfText>
<human> They sound like some great, trustworthy samaritans. I am glad people like that restore my faith in humanity.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They sound like some great, trustworthy samaritans. I am glad people like that restore my faith in humanity. <endOfText>
<human> Yes! It was several years ago and when I look back on it I'm just like, why did you do that mom? Lol. I couldn't see myself doing it as an adult <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone offered me a way to make money fast last week <endOfText>
<human> Was it reputable?  Did you do it?  How did it work out for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been trying to get pregnant and I am feeling all the symptoms of pregnancy. I think I might be! <endOfText>
<human> thats awesome, good luck with that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trusted my father with my car this weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Is he trustworthy> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is great right now! <endOfText>
<human> Really?! What is going on? Tell me :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last Halloween I went to a haunted house. Usually they're pretty tame and fun. <endOfText>
<human> Was this one scary? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Acuna for the braves is on pace to have one of the best rookie seasons of all time <endOfText>
<human> Are you a really big baseball fan? I have friends who have season tickets and love it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my wife's leftovers while she was napping <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness! You must have been very hungry. I hope you don't feel guilty.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my goodness! You must have been very hungry. I hope you don't feel guilty. <endOfText>
<human> I was and i do! it was from her favorite place <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog ate the steak I had cooked for my date. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was the date still good? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea but I was angry the whole time because I had to order Dominos last minute to make up for my dog's... indulgence. <endOfText>
<human> Lol at least Dominos is good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I farted during a work meeting. I feel bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> It happens, was it loud? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty disappointed and ashamed in myself tonight, I ate 3 hot dogs! <endOfText>
<human> Ah ok. Are you trying to lose weight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend said he would help me last week driving me to uni <endOfText>
<human> And did he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little baby just left for college last week. Can't believe he grew up so quickly. <endOfText>
<human> yea its hard to see them leave <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Seeing my dad's old train sets reminds me of him. I wish he was still around. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear about your loss. Was he a good man? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My borother was able to beat cancer! <endOfText>

<human> O really i though the Rangers were on top <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> everytime i am trying something knew i get that paralyzing fear of the unknown feeling. <endOfText>
<human> I wouldn't stress so much if I were you. Everyone has to try something new for the first time and not everyone gets stuff right away. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had yet another death in my family. This year has been the worst. <endOfText>
<human> im sorry, theres nothing worse than that. i hope you're doing okay <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wife!! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Yeah I know!  We've been together for about 10 years now! <endOfText>
<human> wow thats awesome good for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my uncle died last year <endOfText>
<human> oh no!  I'm so sad to hear that :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat was sick for a couple days when i first got them <endOfText>
<human> Oh no did he/she get better? Did you have to take them to the vet? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my cat so much. he is the best. :0 <endOfText>
<human> same, cats are so awesome <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going on a weekend to the lake but ended up getting sick. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. Did you have the flu? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got home from traveling and it feels so nice. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm torn up, my dog had to be put down today because of old age <endOfText>
<human> Oh my Gosh. I am sorry. that can be really tough. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my grandfathers old watch he passed along to me years ago. It finally fits me and I think I will start wearing it for luck. <endOfText>
<human> Haha that's really cool! What kind of watch is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so bad the other day. i spilled coffee on the ground in fron of everyone at the store. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Did the workers have to come clean it up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bet you were a little embarrassed. I wouldnt worry too much about it. Im sure it happens everyday. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks and yea i was. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworkers threw me a welcome-back party when I returned from maternity leave. <endOfText>
<human> That is so nice!  Did you get lots of presents? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, they got me a coffee mug and some baby clothes. It was a nice surprise! <endOfText>
<human> So fun.  Did you have your baby? Congratulations on your pregnancy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every fall my family and I used to go apple picking when I was younger. Those were good times. <endOfText>
<human> Ahh sounds like some great memories. Do you often feel nostalgic about these times? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been in vacation in Mexico for one week now. I am buying gifts for my family before coming back. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, lucky you.  I hope you are enjoying your time there.  They will be appreciative of the gifts. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well its been a long week of work for me, no vacation like you.  However, it is so very nice just to be relaxing at home this evening. <endOfText>
<human> To have some rest after working so hard, it is very important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I broke my laptop screen yesterday and now I am out a hundred bucks to get it fixed! <endOfText>
<human> That sucks! It happens to the best of us. At least the computer didn't break. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought tickets to my favorite band! I am so stoked! <endOfText>
<human> Holy cow that's awesome!  Who is it? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for everything in my life. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> That is great.  Its good to not take family and friends for granted. <endOfText>
<human> You are right, I am so thankful for it all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son has been playing tee ball just like when I used to play. Those were great times for me. <endOfText>
<human> Those are the best times,I can't wait until my son plays. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son will be turning two in a few months and it has me looking back to when he was born. <endOfText>
<human> Aww thats a great time in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother just bought my all time favorite car. <endOfText>
<human> That is cool! What kind of car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a feeling I'm going to be getting a new car soon. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what's wrong with your current car? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dog had puppies <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. What type of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son will be turning two in a few months. <endOfText>
<human> what are you going to do for his birthday <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have my annual evaluation next week.  I hope I get a raise, fingers crossed. <endOfText>
<human> What career do you work in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So disappointed in myself for getting a low mark. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no.  I'm sorry.  Was it due to a test? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my final exam for math last semester. I all set to graduate but now I have to repeat it. Its horrible. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, i am sorry! hopefully youll be able to get it taken care of this time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching a documentary on death row, and its disturbing some of the crimes people commit <endOfText>
<human> Yea those shows are hard to watch.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yea those shows are hard to watch. <endOfText>
<human> They are, i totally agree with the death penalty though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so embarrassed, I had to ditch my date to use the bathroom. I told her I was sick! <endOfText>
<human> Was the date not going well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty satisfied with all the house work I got done today. Yard is mowed and the house is clean! <endOfText>
<human> That's great, I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job, you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great, I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job, you. <endOfText>
<human> Thanks! You should! Better now than tomorrow is my motto! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog got sick last night but I didn't hear it while it was happening. <endOfText>
<human> Is he okay? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure if I want to go tomorrow <endOfText>
<human> Where?  Why are you feeling uncertain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So, the other day I had a test of my character. <endOfText>
<human> What happened/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had ordered some medicine for my dogs.  When I arrived home, I realized that I had paid for a two part kit, but they had given me a four part kit. <endOfText>
<human> Well, I hope you did the right thing and correct their mistake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog had to go to the vet and it took all day. We even had an appointment. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I agree! <endOfText>
<human> We move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets...the least the can do is do their work well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm giving a presentation at work that is going to ensure I get a promotion. I know I'll get it. <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope that you get it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> With my presentation looking so good, there's no reason I shouldn't. <endOfText>
<human> I believe you will get it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait til Red Dead Redemption 2 comes out! The first one was my favorite video game of all time! <endOfText>
<human> that's right, it is supposed to come out  soon, I bet you will enjoy it very much <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was able to workout enough to lose 10 lbs! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. I bet you feel great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife got the flu yesterday. I ended up staying home to make sure she was ok. <endOfText>
<human> Good job. Is she better now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got back from downstairs, what a gross scene. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my brother take care of my dog when I went on vacation. He is the only person who I would let take care of my dog. <endOfText>
<human> Did he do a good job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so happy when I was finally able to buy a motorcycle last week that I've been saving money for. But yesterday I wasn't being careful and I crashed it into my neighbors car and completely destroyed both. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, are you physically okay? It must have been very traumatic for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drank and got drunk out of my mind yesterday despite promising sobriety to my wife. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, that's no good. Did she find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm having heart palpitations all the time and they are very concerning to me. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I feel so dirty and bad <endOfText>
<human> What did you do?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the car packed, the food packed in a cooler, and the car inspected and filled with fuel. Ready for vacation! <endOfText>
<human> sounds sweet, you must be raring to go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The amount of crazy and bad people in the world is scary <endOfText>
<human> I agree.  Has something bad happened to you recently? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I set the burglar alarm to the house every night before bed. Around 3:00am this morning, the alarm went off <endOfText>
<human> Oh man thats scary! What set it off? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm hoping that i get an enormous job that i bid on. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! I bet you'll get it, I have a feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my police test coming up! <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting, what is the test for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone smashed into my car and left. People are horrible! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, thats horrible! Make sure to get a police report and send it to your insurance.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow, thats horrible! Make sure to get a police report and send it to your insurance. <endOfText>
<human> I did and they don't seem like they can help me much since I only got a few numbers of the license plate. I missed work and have been mad ever since. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is going pretty good right now. I have a great job and a wonderful girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome I am happy to hear that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day a homeless man came up to my car and asked me to roll down my window. <endOfText>
<human> I never know what to do in that situation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from a business trip and found food rotting in the fridge with mold growing on everything and fruit flies swarming around. bleh. <endOfText>
<human> oh just wait.. that's nothing. How long were you gone for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I crapped my pants at wallmart once. I couldn't find the bathroom and well you know... <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  I've had that happen before. Not at Walmart but at a dentist office. Did you make a dash out of there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> LOL at a dentist is even worse! I rode with my mom so the ride home wasn't pleasant for her. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I had to tell them some might be on the chair.  It was crazy awful! Oh no, ha ha. sorry that happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is going on a trip for a weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to miss him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried following a recipe for vegan cookies and they turned out horribly. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh. What went wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know. I followed the steps, but when they were out of the oven, they just fell apart and basically turned into crumbles. <endOfText>
<human> That's too bad. Did they taste okay though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I was not feeling well at all. I missed a couple days of work and was so tired by the time I went back in. <endOfText>
<human> Aw, that stinks. What was wrong? Were you sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just saw an old tv show on tv and it reminded me of the old days <endOfText>
<human> Heck yeah!  I love old tv shows!  What was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my mom so much <endOfText>
<human> Me too. Moms are the bees knees. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm confident I'm going to hit my new bench press max tomorrow at the gym! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! I'm sure you will, I love going to the gym. I mainly do cardio. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been excited to sell this stuff around my house i never use. I'm making pretty good money! <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! I need to have a garage sale. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just started to take his first steps. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That's amazing. I remember when mine started. It's off to the races soon!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! That's amazing. I remember when mine started. It's off to the races soon! <endOfText>
<human> That is the truth, we will be chasing him soon. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My flight got cancelled and I missed my son's birthday. <endOfText>
<human> Aw man. I'm sorry. How old did he turn? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is going to do great things! <endOfText>
<human> I sure hope so, do you think he is a determined and intelligent person? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I had to babysit my new born nephew whilst my sister went on vacation! <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of you. I am sure that your sister appreciated that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a hair in my food while eating at a restaurant with my boyfriend <endOfText>
<human> Ewww, I hope you complained so they can fix the problem! That is defenitly a health violation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember going to the beach every year when I was young. Wish I could do that again. <endOfText>
<human> i know how you feel, being young and at the beach was a fun time <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just left for college and I don't want to throw away his old comic books and trophies. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that's really sweet. I understand being sentimental about that sort of stuff. Do you feel like you have to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I am really attached to his stuff. He told me get rid of his old stuff but I think I will let him know I just can't do it. <endOfText>
<human> You should just keep it for now. He may think that stuff is corny now, but later in life he will be glad you kept it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate the last of my roomie's ice cream. <endOfText>
<human> Haha how dare you. lol just kidding. What kind? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone wrecked my car the other day. I'm so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awful! Will insurance cover it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You ever just have a good week where nothing bad happens? <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, not in awhile, but I definitely know that feeling.  Are you having a great week? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Got everything packed and ready for my camping trip this weekend. Should be a great time. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's awesome!  Where ya going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to clean my trash can. <endOfText>
<human> Filled up? You better clean it before it overflows! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm furious, my cell phone bill this month is 200 dollars more than last months. <endOfText>
<human> Wowza, did you call to complain? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was holding my brother's newborn earlier today... I held them up a little bit, with them facing down at me, and they puked all over me. Pretty cool. Can't get the smell of baby vomit out of my nose. <endOfText>
<human> I have had that happen to me many times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband put together a graduation party for me and I had idea! <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of him. What idea did you have? As in how to return the favor or something? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex girlfriend was flirting with these guys right in front of me. She loves the attention. <endOfText>
<human> That's kind of disgusting. I'm glad she's your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Went on the very first job interview after graduating. I was nervous, but I felt like it went fairly well. They said they would contact me soon, but it's been a week. I'm not sure what I should do at this point, but I'm staying positive. <endOfText>
<human> They probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My baby boy just moved out to be on his own this last weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is.  It is the very thing we raise them to do, but it is so hard to let go.  After we got him all moved into his new home, I returned home and opened the family photo album to reflect on all of my 4 children.  I'm proud of them all, but I sure miss the days of their presence in my home. <endOfText>
<human> I completely understand. My little baby just went off to college and although I miss him terribly, I am also proud of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own. <endOfText>
<human> It is.  It is the very thing we raise them to do, but it is so hard to let go.  After we got him all moved into his new home, I returned home and opened the family photo album to reflect on all of my 4 children.  I'm proud of them all, but I sure miss the days of their presence in my home.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ahh, the joys of visiting home. My mom fixed me 3 course meal of my most favorite dishes! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds amazing!  Mom's food is ALWAYS the best. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have done a very bad thing and feel terrible about it <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i ate my wife's leftovers while she was taking a nap <endOfText>
<human> haha. has she found out yet? i bet she was mad <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our home was broken into right after we moved in. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a nightmare! Hopefully no one was hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm signed up to go sky diving soon for the first time. <endOfText>
<human> That will be fun. I went for my 18th birthday and it was exciting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when movies actually focused more on the plot and acting rather than the special effects. I miss those times. <endOfText>
<human> I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully it goes back to that, after all the special effect hype dies down! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm supposed to be on a diet, but today I ate a bunch of Hershey's Kisses. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, couldn't resist? Just make up and eat well tomorrow! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Absolutely. I don't know why I even have them in the house. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, you should hide them at least! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to my favorite restaurant tomorrow i cant wait <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. What are you gonna eat there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something nice happened to me yesterday <endOfText>
<human> That is nice, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I was in 8th grade, I had to sing the national anthem at my middle school graduation in front of hundreds of students and parents <endOfText>
<human> It must have been nerve wracking! Did you do well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So yea, last night my brain decided to replay a moment from high school when I forgot my lines in the live drama. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One day after work, I was sitting at a table with one of my coworkers and my boss. I was 14 at the time and we worked in a bakery. I said something about brown cows and chocolate milk. That was when i realized that chocolate milk didnt come from brown cows. <endOfText>
<human> Haha too funny! Wow 14?! Suprised you didn't learn it earlier haha  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know! I felt so dumb. We all laughed so hard. <endOfText>
<human> I bet, thats a great memory! lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Haha too funny! Wow 14?! Suprised you didn't learn it earlier haha <endOfText>
<human> I know! I felt so dumb. We all laughed so hard.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was going to order some tshirts online,but the website is from the ukrane and seems pretty sketchy <endOfText>
<human> i agree with you there, I do not trust those eastern bloc countries. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend thought it would be funny to stand behind my door and scare me. I shrieked. <endOfText>
<human> My husband does that all the time to! Must be a guy thing haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man.  Only a couple weeks to go!!! <endOfText>
<human> That's a loaded statement.. Can you unpack that for me? What are you so excited about that's coming up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat dragged a freakin OWL into the house through the dog door the other night. I came home at midnight to a pitch black house, went up the stairs, and something flew over my darn head. Turned the light on and he was staring back at me... <endOfText>
<human> hahahaha that's so funny.  Did you get it out of the house? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Its been cloudy all day and I think it will rain heavily pretty soon! <endOfText>
<human> Rainy days are perfect for being lazy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got lost in an unfamiliar part of town. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, it must have been scary for you being in an unknown area, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a car that I have been trying to afford for months! <endOfText>
<human> What car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really excited for the new super smash bros, it looks awesome so far! <endOfText>
<human> I agree, looks like a great game to play with friends! When is it coming out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know my wife will be there for me, good or bad. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, thats a kind of woman every man needs in their life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm in high spirits with my new job, I have a feeling I'm going to love working there. <endOfText>
<human> What new job did you get? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor is so luck <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah, what makes you say that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't too sure I got the right hairstyle but today a stranger complimented me on my hair! <endOfText>
<human> What'd they say exactly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> watching old black and white western tv shows really brings back good memories of my grandparents <endOfText>
<human> That must make you feel good. Any favorites?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That must make you feel good. Any favorites? <endOfText>
<human> it does. i really dont have a favorite, i never paid attention to them too much as a kid. but i do rember bonanza <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My ex and I went to Branson a few weeks ago. It was so much fun! <endOfText>
<human> i have never gone. was it really that much fun going with an ex though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> well we broke up afterwards lol. But the trip was still fun. There are some cool things to do there depending on where you live. <endOfText>
<human> maybe i will check it out. i have heard good things about Branson <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My tooth has been killing me lately. <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get sentimental about my girlfriend, she means a lot to me <endOfText>
<human> That is really sweet. It sounds like you really love her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spent this entire summer thinking I was going to lose weight, that I was going to be good on my diet and workout. I did neither. I stayed inside, played video games, ate horribly, and got grumpy ate everybody who reminded me of my promise. Now winter is coming and it's going to be even harder to motivate myself. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry that sounds awful disappointing. If it's any consolation I think it's easier to diet than to work out. THe old phrase "can't outrun the fork." <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just bought a new Range Rover. <endOfText>
<human> that sounds cool, they are a great vehicle <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my grandmother passed yestserday. she was the one who raised me <endOfText>
<human> oh im so sorry! it hurts when our parents leave us.  my uncle, who was basically my father, died in april. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very disappointed in the pizza I ordered. It was pretty much burnt with no toppings! <endOfText>
<human> That's awful. Are you going to complain to the restaurant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I watch baseball, I think of my grandpa. <endOfText>
<human> Why does baseball remind you of him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to build an IKEA dresser tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> That must of been no fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought all the ingredients, learned the recipe, and now its time to make a pizza! <endOfText>
<human> Yum! I had pizza as well tonight, although I didn't make it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home to a huge pile of dog poop, it was absolutely disgusting. <endOfText>
<human> Ugh, do you know how it got there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm worried about my job interview tomorrow, I really want this job. I hate this feeling! <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you will do fine! Just be confident, what is the job/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So the new paper boy tried to toss the paper over the fence and ended up breaking my window. <endOfText>
<human> Haha i am sorry to laugh. Is it an expensive window to fix. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I suppose its funny now but I was furious in the morning! It might cost me a couple of hundred to get it fixed! <endOfText>
<human> Damn, I am sorry that happenened.. did you talk to the paper boy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog and cat can't seem to get along. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Have you tried encouraging them to play together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was so sad when my hamster died recently due to a heart attack. Maybe I shouldn't have fed him so many cheetos. I cry every day thinking about him. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I am so sorry. It's OK, it probably wasn't the cheetos that got him - rodents just don't have a long lifespan. I hope you feel better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm terrified of meeting my girlfriend's parents tomorrow. She said they never like her choice of boyfriends! <endOfText>
<human> Do you think you can impress them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Driving is such a scary thing for me, it was my first time. <endOfText>
<human> It definitely can be, just learn to drive defensively! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a brisket tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Are you prepared? Do you have all the ingredients? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went through an old photo album that I didn't even know existed when I was cleaning out my attic! <endOfText>
<human> Did it bring back good memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> its so hard to find a reliable person to babysit nowadays <endOfText>
<human> I can understand your frustration. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my credit card and someone charged 500 dollars on it. <endOfText>
<human> did you call your card company? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Halloween is scary stuff that's for sure. <endOfText>
<human> Do little kids dressed as witches and ghosts frighten you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The policeman was nice bringing me home. <endOfText>
<human> That is a very nice thing for him to do. Where did he pick you up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just gave my best friend a key to my house. I have known him my whole life and I feel safe with him having access to my home. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you give him access to your home though? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hesitated before getting on the rollercoaster because it looked so scary! <endOfText>
<human> im terrified of rollercoasters <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Same. But the thrill that you feel is worth the terror and tension! <endOfText>
<human> i agree, i just get on and close my eyes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> tonight i tripped while out at dinner, total clums <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, I hope you weren't embarrassed about it, if it was a good trip? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice! I would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldn't like it if I did! <endOfText>
<human> lol, too funny!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently came across my old high school year book. <endOfText>
<human> Did it help you rewind the old times?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Did it help you rewind the old times? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, definitely. Was a great trip down memory lane. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I already booked my flight for vacation before requesting a leave from work! <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's exciting and terrifying. Do you think it will work out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when people used to be more courteous. <endOfText>
<human> How so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a flight coming up and i absolutely hate flying. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, flying is the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally didn't confess all my sins oops. <endOfText>
<human> Oh you left some out then? Were they worse ones? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm a bit let down by my workplace recently <endOfText>
<human> How come, what are you doing wrong at work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my wife so much! <endOfText>
<human> That ig good to hear! How long have you been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally hurt my dog pretty bad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a job interview coming up! <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! Do you feel like you are ready? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is nothing I can complain about. I have a nice house, a great family and a decent job. Life is good. <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's awesome!  Any plans this weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month I found out my son decided to drop out of college without telling me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that sounds terrible. Hopefully it's not as bad as some of those stories I have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom has taken on my brother's two children in the interim while he deals with social services, for getting in trouble with the law. She's in her 60s, and she's handling a 2-year-old and 7-year-old, while working full time. I'm proud of her. <endOfText>
<human> Your mom must be a strong woman. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally bounced a check today. <endOfText>
<human> What a bummer. Did you have any sort of coverage for it? And how did you do it accidentally? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I work as a self-employed transcriptionist. I told my client I'd have work done this week, but my university classes also started this week... and things kind of got away from me, and they won't be done. I'm worried he's going to just tell me he'll have someone else do them, and I'll lose his business. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah well you only have so much time to work with. Time management is one of the most important skills you can learn. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was so awkward when I realized I had worn my wife's dress to work the other day. My first clue something was wrong was when I felt I was wrapped like a stuffed sausage. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you unconsciously wanted to wear it. Maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you? What if you went and did it again the next day, to see if you liked it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt good about my job interview, I think that I have a good chance to get the job <endOfText>
<human> Whoop Whoop! That's awesome! I hope you get the job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won tickets to my favorite show! Yahoo! <endOfText>
<human> What show is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm back in my old college town for the first time since graduating. It's weird how many memories flood back from just physically being in a space. I'm seeing all the places I used to eat, my old apartment, my campus, and my friends here and there... makes me wish I could go back <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it's weird going back to college. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a grown woman pick her nose and eat it earlier. <endOfText>
<human> Okay, so I never understood why people ate it. What is it about it that makes them want to do that? I just flicked mine. And I thought it stopped at a child's age. Really interesting. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was traveling last month and the airplane smelled like it hadn't been cleaned for months. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did because I was disgusted by it! Safe to say, I am never flying American Airlines again! <endOfText>
<human> Good, I would avoid that airline too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I kept thinking I had left the front door unlocked whilst I was on vacation! <endOfText>
<human> That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so looking forward to the next Avatar sequel. It seems like I have been waiting forever. I am growing impatient. <endOfText>
<human> Avatar the Airbender or James Cameroons Avatar? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset the Eagles lost yesterday, they lost to the worst team in the league, and got shutout <endOfText>
<human> They just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up and saw someone staring at me in the middle of the night! <endOfText>
<human> Who was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was.. at home alone.. doing some self-pleasuring, if you will... and my roommate almost walked in on me. I managed to jump into my closet while pulling up my pants before he could see me. So happy I didn't have to have that awkward conversation <endOfText>
<human> Haha good timing by your roommate. Does he not knock? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love going back and playing Pokemon Emerald, that game was a massive part of my childhood <endOfText>
<human> I bet it brings back lots of great memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband is training a new female employee at work. <endOfText>
<human> How does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to go to a doctor's appointment on Monday. <endOfText>
<human> That is always a drag. I hope it is routine and nothing serious. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend got such a pretty girlfriend. I don't know how he does it. I look better than him but he gets the pretty girls. <endOfText>
<human> I totally know what you mean. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if you have experience with small children, but when my daughter was 3 years old, she spoke her mind all the time. <endOfText>
<human> Did she ever embarass you out in public? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for the new pokemon game, I am super excited, it looks like an amazing game! <endOfText>
<human> My girls seem to like the Pokemon Go game - is this a new one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw this amazing dog on the television the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! What was the dog doing or what was the show about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a little girl that was lost wandering around the mall. I took her to one of the stores so they could call security. Her mother finally found her. <endOfText>
<human> That is crazy, how did they get separated? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping I will get promoted at my job soon enough, that would be great <endOfText>
<human> I am sure you deserve it for all the hard work you do. I will send in my recommendation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made the luckiest choice investing in bitcoin. <endOfText>
<human> How much money did you make with it? I assume most people would have sold before the peak out of fear of it crashing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Interesting...lol <endOfText>
<human> I am not happy with how the Eagles played yesterday, they lost to the browns of all teams- by 5 points, 5-0, what a lame game <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is starting to develop dementia early. I feel like I'm losing such an important figure in my life much earlier than I should, even though she's still alive. Like, she struggles so much with daily activities and remembering who I am <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry. I just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimer's. I wish there was some way I could help you, it is such a tough road. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not happy with how the Eagles played yesterday, it was not good <endOfText>
<human> That game was suprising. The browns of all teams lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went for a ride on a roller coaster the other day and it rattled me. <endOfText>
<human> What coaster did you ride? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just bought some luggage bags.  Getting ready! <endOfText>
<human> I just got done traveling myself! There's no better feeling than the anticipating of traveling. I love airports, especially, because of all the people-watching and the general atmosphere. I hope your trip goes smoothly! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Spent the entire summer with my long distance girlfriend, and now I'm back at home for university. Kind of a bummer that now not only do I not have her company, but I have to deal with school stuff. From one extreme to the other. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I bet summer went by quick for you then.  Did you have fun together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared of how work is going to go, it is the start of our busiest period of the year <endOfText>
<human> It'll be OK :) How long does this busyness usually last for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I moved to a new area and feel isolated because i don't know anyone. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you move? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> Some people have better cards then we do in life. It's how you play your cards though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My cat is buts. he meows all night long. Its getting ridiculous. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you get a cat? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my son's piggy bank. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared of this upcoming season wiht Wentz being hurt, the Eagles might be in trouble <endOfText>
<human> He should be recovered by the early part of the season. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am scared of how work is going to go, it is the start of our busiest period of the year <endOfText>
<human> It's hard for me to empathize since I'm just in college right now. But my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way, and I hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work. I try to give her her space and to be understanding. Hopefully people do that with you, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My classmates at university are so gossip-y. They get so catty with one another, and spread rumors behind each other's backs. We're in a small major, so everyone knows everyone in this group of 50 students, and a lot of them dislike each other for no good reason <endOfText>
<human> I get that, I have had jobs like that, some people just thrive on drama, they do not enjoy anything more than that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I won a small contest. So, my friend was there when I entered the contest, and he was the one that encouraged me to enter. Now that I won, he says he deserves some of the winnings because he was the one that made me enter. I disagree. But he keeps bothering me about it. <endOfText>
<human> Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lsot my job the other day and am pretty lost myself. <endOfText>
<human> I hate sayings, but the one that goes, "Tough times don't last, but tough people do," really applies. Life is long. You have plenty of time to change your fortune, and you seem self aware enough to do it. I hope you can work your way back up. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow what an absolutely amazing day! <endOfText>
<human> Why is it a great day? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt terrible when I broke our television a few weeks ago <endOfText>
<human> How did you break the TV? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just took a very hard test in math. Tomorrow I will see how I did <endOfText>
<human> Did you study for it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always get so happy during the holiday season. It's coming up soon <endOfText>
<human> Me too! What is your favorite part? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is coming to visit me tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Cool!  What are you all gonna do?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cool!  What are you all gonna do? <endOfText>
<human> We are going to go clubbing! I am so happy to see her! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man. This printer is GETTING ON MY NERVES!! <endOfText>
<human> I know right, some printers are just terrible. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can feel your frustration. <endOfText>
<human> I have a pond outside.  I wonder if I should throw it in there.  THEN IT WILL DEFINITELY BE OUT OF INK!!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are supposed to get severe thunderstorms tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I love thunderstorms.... though I know they make some people really uncomfortable.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, I love thunderstorms.... though I know they make some people really uncomfortable. <endOfText>
<human> I enjoy them if they don't get dangerous. I put together a storm emergency kit just in case. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone keyed my car at work today. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes!  Did you find out who it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started cleaning my attic yesterday <endOfText>
<human> I bet you found some cool stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to Walmart the other day to get my nephew a birthday present, he wanted Legos! <endOfText>
<human> I love Legos! They have gotten expensive though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a man eat a 3 foot sub sandwich. <endOfText>
<human> WOW!  All by himself in one sitting?? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was shocked to see a well known good team defeat another well known bad team in a football game last night. <endOfText>
<human> Haha. Which one were you rooting for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my wallet and someone found it and returned it to me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's quite luck and fortunate for you, I've never had a lost wallet returned. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't believe my 'ex" best friend". he sarted dating my ex girl friend. <endOfText>
<human> Yuck!  I hate when friends do that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My appointment is coming up <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was starting a new job and could not sleep the night before. I was feeling extremely anxious about the decision to change jobs. <endOfText>
<human> Did you ease your nerves? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to lunch by myself today. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes solitude can be a good thing. Were you hoping for company? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One year i filed false tax forms and i feel really bad about it. I feel like i cheated on society. <endOfText>
<human> have you been contacted by the IRS? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to the grocery store today and i saw a kid walking around alone crying <endOfText>
<human> Awwww, that's so sad. Was he lost? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite football team lost tonight. <endOfText>
<human> American football or soccer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man I bought this stupid new printer.  I paid a lot of money for it. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a bummer, what brand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This lady at my grocery store was obssed with asking me my political party. I had to almost run away from her. <endOfText>
<human> shees! some people just dont understand some things others just dont care to talk about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at a bar yesterday and a pretty girl was near and looking my way and started talking to me <endOfText>
<human> Wowza...how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love my dog. he will do anything for me. He scared home invaders away the other night. <endOfText>
<human> What a loyal dog! They are such good creatures. We humans don't deserve them.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What a loyal dog! They are such good creatures. We humans don't deserve them. <endOfText>
<human> Haha i agree. We are too lucky evolution provided such wonderful cute creatures. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Burger King today and they totally messed up my order. <endOfText>
<human> Did you take it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You know what I tried the other night? <endOfText>
<human> No, tell me about it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is horrible right now. i lsot my job and my girlfriend broke up with me. :( <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. It will get better, though.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so sorry to hear that. It will get better, though. <endOfText>
<human> I hope so. I need some type of boost to help me be more motivated. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home yesterday from work and found my fish floating :( <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I am so sorry. was he old? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah I've had him for 37 years.  It sucked <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Sounds like he had a full life. You are a good pet owner.:) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a child and feel so great. <endOfText>
<human> Hey congrats!!!  Hows being a parent working <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I graduated and feel so happy. It feels great knowing it's over. <endOfText>
<human> That must be such a relief! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is! I had some moments where I thought about quitting. <endOfText>
<human> In a way, it is actually just the beginning. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone threw away my lunch at work today. <endOfText>
<human> They didn't even eat it! How dare they!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so my brother bought the car i had my eye on <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what car was it?  Are you jealous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son behaved so well on his first day of school. <endOfText>
<human> thats good! how old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I fell asleep waiting for my plane at the airport and someone woke me up because i was snoring too loud. <endOfText>
<human> haha.  Where they mad?  and how did you react? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow is going to be.......scary!! <endOfText>
<human> OH NO! How so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got back from hockey, my buddy made the team! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! He must be pretty good. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am about to start my new job on Monday! I can't wait! <endOfText>

<human> What kind of dog is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled some tea all over my lap today. <endOfText>
<human> Are you ok. Did you need to go to the hospital? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a crowded coffee shop last week and decided to to run to the bathroom leaving my macbook behind. I never thought about someone stealing it.\ <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that sounds like a nightmare. Did you get it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So annoyed at my friend. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My friend got the job promotion I was supposed to get. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I have to take the bar exam next week. <endOfText>
<human> That can be daunting. I hope you are prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My youngest niece will be 17 soon. I find myself thinking back to when she was little and I just get teary eyed. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, kids grow up so fast these days. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a six layer bean dip later today. <endOfText>
<human> are you excited for this? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> It's a wonderful Saturday morning and I am so anxious to see what today has to offer! <endOfText>
<human> I think that's a wonderful attitude to have! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the bathroom and walked in to a horror show. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> One time I was in walmart and peed on myself <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> A wonderful night of drinking with friends ended terribly. <endOfText>

<human> It's always great to have friends that are willing to help out when you need them the most. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone tried to break into my house last week when I was home! <endOfText>
<human> thats sounds horrifying <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my friend cancelled on me last minute <endOfText>
<human> Ah that sucks. Did they have a good reason to do so? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drank all of my best friend's beer and didn't tell him. <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to replace it before he found out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am a very dedicated member of my family which sometimes can be a bit much to handle. <endOfText>
<human> Ah yes, do other members cause some trouble for you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had to send my food back tonight at the restaurant. we were at my favorite restaurant <endOfText>
<human> why did you have to send it back? what happend <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> SO ANGRY! my cat destroyed jacket! i woke up to wear it and she just destroyed all of it, it was my new jacket too <endOfText>
<human> Oh that's awful!  Maybe you can try to return it and say it came like that LOL <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it's not funny, and they won't rethurn it! <endOfText>
<human> It's a little funny <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked hard on my yard sale. I was quite pleased with the sales and knew that there was nothing else I could have done to make it more successful. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! It feels good when you can get a little back from the things you have invested so much in! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home tonight to find a huge shock! <endOfText>
<human> WHAT WAS THE SHOCK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so much going on, all these feelings are making me anxious and scared <endOfText>
<human> Why?  What is going on? <endOfText>

<human> what makes you think so? i'm pretty sure you aren't. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wan't to help my fiance, she is going through so much, my job isn't paying me much and i've been working as hard as i can and i still can't do much, i wan't her to come here already because she is the only thing that keeps me sane <endOfText>
<human> that doesn't make you a failure! you are doing more than enough and i'm pretty sure she appreciate every single thing you're doing for her. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> tomorrow we find out if we are having a baby boy or girl <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow!  Congrats!!  What are you hoping for? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I'm having such trouble with a co-worker.  She has no manners at all! <endOfText>
<human> really? like how? what she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> don't worry, with people like this karma hits them very very hard, and they get what they deserve <endOfText>
<human> I hope so.  I'm debating whether to let me boss know.  If she does that to a stranger she could be gotten for violating the ADA <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> someone almost hit me with their car today <endOfText>
<human> Were you driving or walking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have enough money to pay for my groceries and had to put something back. There were a lot of people in line. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I watched my daughter hit another big milestone in her life this week. <endOfText>
<human> wow! that's amazing what did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so happy and proud of myself! i am so smart! <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Is there a particular reason, or just in general? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i mean both, i am smart in general but recently i have been workign super hard and learning more and more and it's paying off, yesterday i just came up with my owm math formula <endOfText>
<human> that's so great! cONGRATS! <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I had a really great lunch today. <endOfText>
<human> thats really nice <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i am so alone, no one is here and i wan't to speak with my fiance <endOfText>
<human> Is there no way to get in touch with anyone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i just want this next week to be over, i have a holiday planned, but until then i shall remain forever alone in this room <endOfText>
<human> Why are you alone in a room? Do you need me to come over? <endOfText>

<human> i am lucky to have someone like my fiancee too! what makes you so grateful about your fiancee <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> this world is just cruel isn't it? i mean where is the love, do we really hate eachother that much? <endOfText>
<human> i agree. everyone seems to be out for themself and do not care to help other or take others into consideration <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it sucks so much <endOfText>
<human> yeah its a tought thing to have to deal with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to pick up some food and got the wrong change back....but didnt realize untill i got home <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> i am so frustrated ! at work my colleagues are not understanding it's so annoying! because i am realtively knew and young they are condescending me <endOfText>
<human> this happens a lot at work, maybe try to talk to them about it?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yeah but they are so full of themselves it's hard <endOfText>
<human> i agree everyone is just self-centered and it's very annoying to communicate with those people. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> this happens a lot at work, maybe try to talk to them about it? <endOfText>
<human> yeah but they are so full of themselves it's hard  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I actually just moved to a new state for work. <endOfText>

<human> Now you know who to call when you want to go away again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid my sister got the bike that I really wanted. I begrudged her that bike for a long time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah my brother would always get some things I wanted too. Made me feel jealous.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was especially hard because she didn't really care about the bike. <endOfText>
<human> That's even worse. Well I hope you at least got to ride it when she wasn't looking! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah my brother would always get some things I wanted too. Made me feel jealous. <endOfText>
<human> It was especially hard because she didn't really care about the bike.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a guy lie his way through taking a test <endOfText>
<human> oh no! why didn't you do anything about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> today, i made a discovery and that made me so happy in myself <endOfText>
<human> oh wow! what was the discovery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i discovered  that if you cook ham with cheese and bake it under the oven you can create the most delicious unofficial pizza <endOfText>
<human> mind. blown. that sounds breath taking <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> our lord and saviour will help us! he will guide us all to paradise, i have faith ! <endOfText>

<human> i know, there's nothing like true love . <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Can't believe I got that mark. <endOfText>
<human> As in a grade? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I entered a bowling tournament and felt I had a pretty good chance to do well. <endOfText>
<human> How did you end up doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a close call earlier, someone asked me out. <endOfText>
<human> what? what did you do/ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so worthless! if i had listened to her everything would have been okay now <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I finally did it, opened up to her. <endOfText>
<human> oh did it go well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont really know anyone at uni <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous of meeting new friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ever just stare at the ocean at dark? the bright moon shining into the water and into the retina of your eyes, it makes you very sentimental <endOfText>
<human> yes! i live about 30 mins away from the coast . i love going at night <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son took his first steps today! <endOfText>

<human> I'm sorry to hear that, can you make it up to them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got the worst mark back on my science test. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I'm so upset right now. <endOfText>
<human> Tell me what has you so worked up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to do all of my shopping for Thanksgiving dinner early so I will be ready and I don't have to fight the crowds. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good idea, what do you need to buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I scour the sales ads for the early specials and then make my list accordingly. <endOfText>
<human> That's smart, I love a big turkey dinner the family will be pleased I bet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i almost wasnt going to take my pharmacy tech certification exam. was too expensive <endOfText>
<human> What did you decide to do instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's such a tough choice whether to apply to university or not. <endOfText>
<human> what else would you do if you didnt go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont really know anyone at uni <endOfText>
<human> Did you try going to any clubs to meet anyone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother is lucky to have me that's for sure. <endOfText>
<human> why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sushi really creeps me out, I wasn't able to try any. <endOfText>
<human> why does it creep you out? i think it's pretty good <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sucks not being strong. <endOfText>
<human> why is that? what happend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow have you ever driven a manual car? <endOfText>
<human> Just once. If the car had not died I would have hit a building. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in a hurry to get home but I hit every red light and was late. By the time I got home I was fit to be tied. <endOfText>
<human> Did you make it home in time? <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> It's so nice living here with my mom and dad. <endOfText>
<human> did you just move back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to a new restaurant that has been getting bad reviews, it was actually really good. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of restaurant was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it was a new mexican restaurant. i think the reviews were inaccurate <endOfText>
<human> I do love a good burrito, I should go check it out some time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had an experience that I need to get off my chest. <endOfText>
<human> go on! tell me about it, let's hear it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my house has been very quiet since my dog died last week <endOfText>
<human> how long did you have your dog for? that must've been very painful, losing a pet is always hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when someone does not take the hint to stop talking <endOfText>
<human> With those kind of people you just have to be blunt. If that doesn't work then it's time to excuse yourself from the conversation. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching some old TV shows and it really made me start thinking about my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> were they good memories? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really missing my dog Freddy today. He passed away recently at age 16. He was my constant companion. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, I"m sorry to hear that! I know how hard that can be to lose a loved pet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son graduated high school today <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! What is he planning on doing next? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been looking for a job. I want to do something fun but also need to apply for boring ones just so I can get paid. <endOfText>
<human> fun jobs with good pay do exist <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Once I rode the city bus and a guy tried to get a free ride and an argument broke out between him and the driver. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, it's crazy what some people will try. But, sometimes an argument can get very interesting to watch! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> ever since my brother moved out last month the house has been so quiet <endOfText>
<human> I understand! I felt the same when my son left, it's seems so much less noise and talk. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> hii friends, in my life friends are most real persons <endOfText>
<human> A good friend is hard to find. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes i have best friend <endOfText>
<human> How long have you been friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Most of my friends have moved or gotten married so I don't see them much anymore. <endOfText>
<human> yes. this situation happened every friends relation.due to this we are in relation with a family members <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I need to buy a new car. I am looking at something that uses alternative fuel, but I cant decide what kind to buy. <endOfText>
<human> that could def be an improvemnt. what kind did you have in mind <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my brother showed up to my bday party . he moved out of the state 6 months ago. i hadnt seen him since <endOfText>
<human> Was it a suprise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching the news on social media and there was a terrible story on animal abuse. The kind of people that do this just make me sick <endOfText>
<human> i really do hate that stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's unbelievable how cruel people can be. <endOfText>
<human> its a sick sad world <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i ordered a limited editon tshirt from my favorite band and they sent the wrong size <endOfText>
<human> Were you able to return it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> yes but i dont know if i should. they said they are out of my size. <endOfText>
<human> Does it fit. Id just have them send me a new one when it comes back in stock. Its their mistake. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking alone one night and a puppy started following me. It was so cute. I didnt know what to do." <endOfText>
<human> did he go home with you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to the store today and realized i took an item without paying <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! Well, it happens sometimes, we get so busy and don't notice.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, no! Well, it happens sometimes, we get so busy and don't notice. <endOfText>
<human> that is exactly what happend, baby was crying and i forgot the case of water under the cart <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I paid off all my bills. Its such a great feeling." <endOfText>
<human> that's fantastic! It certainly is a great feeling, financial freedom! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was going to place an online order for a tshirt, but the site was really sketchy <endOfText>
<human> What was sketchy about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was sitting here playing video games and heard something loud <endOfText>
<human> What was it it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Awesome! <endOfText>
<human> Well good luck with whatever is out there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant wait till I save enough money to take a trip to Antarctica. Its been a dream of mine. <endOfText>
<human> Are you currently saving up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always tell the truth to the police. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good thing. Lying to the police opens a whole world of trouble. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to the ER when I cut my hand. I was very concerned about the course of the treatment while waiting to see the Doctor. <endOfText>
<human> How did you cut your hand? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a teenager the restaurant where I was working was robbed. I was scared to death. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get hurt doing the robbery? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really do not want to go to the concert tomorrow. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going because someone else wants to or was it something that you wanted to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rushed through a school crosswalk yesterday in quite an unsafe manner. I am fairly embarrassed about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no did people look at you judgingly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home in my new mclaren to show it to my friend. <endOfText>
<human> Whow! That is one mean car!   What did your friend say? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well It looked puny compared to my friends new bugatti though, so nobody cared baout mine... <endOfText>
<human> That must be quite exciting to drive around in those supercars! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to take my final a few months ago. I usually hate exams, but I really loved my class and was ready to ace it. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. What are you studying? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Film major. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been preparing for a marathon for months. I feel ready. I am sure that I will be able to finish it. <endOfText>
<human> Whats the distance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really have feelings for my new girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of feelings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People told me buying 100k of apple stock in the 90's was a bad idea. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you didn't listen to them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been preparing for a triathlon for months. I feel ready. <endOfText>
<human> Hopefully all of your hard work will pay off and you will do well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The kids wanted me to take them skating but I just didn't feel like it. So I told them I had something else to do. Later I felt bad for doing this. <endOfText>
<human> I understand. Did you finally took them skating? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a trip to Israel last year. I read online about the questions they ask. I was definitely ready for the border agents. <endOfText>
<human> Did you run into any problems? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We planned a trip to the Bahamas and we leave in three days! I can't wait! <endOfText>
<human> Is it your first time there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my grandmother got ill,i was spending my whole summer with her and helping her <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you. Is she still alive? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my cat last week. I am so sad. <endOfText>
<human> How that happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wallet was stollen at work. I am so angry. <endOfText>
<human> Do you know who stole it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so ready for college football tonight. <endOfText>
<human> Are you playing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine just bought a new car. It just happened to be the the one I always wanted. <endOfText>
<human> WHat kind of car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am enrolled in a motorcycle class tomorrow! I am a little nervous though! <endOfText>
<human> Wow. That sounds exciting. You should do fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was about to have my meeting with the Pres of the USA. <endOfText>
<human> About to, what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew going into the meeting what I wanted to tell him about my denuclearization.  He bought it hook line and sinker. <endOfText>
<human> Is your name Kim by any chance? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  fell asleep on the train in India. I woke up to find my wallet missing. <endOfText>
<human> Uhoh.  I'm assuming it was not safely returned to you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Life was easier before. There was less lay off and it was easier to buy a house. Now, everything is more expensive and more complicated. <endOfText>
<human> Yes but that is how it goes sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ok with my current money situation. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Are you working? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really wish I was tall like my brother. <endOfText>
<human> You are wonderful just the way you are! Be happy that you are alive and healthy and beautiful! I am sure your brother wishes he could have something of yours too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 15 year old son took my ferrari out for a test drive and crashed it. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you had insurance. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loaned my car to a girlfriend once many years ago. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hope nothing bad came from that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My doctor told me to give up caffeine to help calm down my anxiety. <endOfText>
<human> That's really hard to do. I should do the same thing, but I still start my day with a big glass of iced coffee every day. It could help though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am ready for my exam next week. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck. What class? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really want to buy a koss porta pro. I miss those headphones. I used to own a pair, but prices have gone way up. <endOfText>
<human> Sometime you got to pay for quality. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a job interview yesterday. It went so good, I know I got the job. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you did. Is it one that you really wanted ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm nervous about the last half of the year. I've been having rough financial times. They'll get better in February, but it's a long time till then. <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that. I am sure you be fine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started learning free climbing without ropes from a professional! I hope he really knows what he is doing! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what a thrilling sport. Yeah, I sure hope he knows what he's doing. You life depends on it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so mad I can't play soccer this season. <endOfText>
<human> Why can't you play? That must be very disappointing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sang last night at the bar. I am a bad singer, I am fool for singing. <endOfText>
<human> haha, why did you go on?  peer pressure? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is one and climbs everything! <endOfText>
<human> Is that good or bad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish they would bring back VCRs. <endOfText>
<human> I know. Those were the days.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know. Those were the days. <endOfText>
<human> I like the fact you ha to rewind after viewing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year a hurricane hit our city and we lost power for a few days. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, did the house get any damage? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have currently two jobs. I applied for a job which the salary is enough for me. I was called for an interview. <endOfText>
<human> That's great, hope you get it! But, seems you have much on your plate already. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my job last week! It is horrible and has completely destroyed my plans for the future and my finances! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no. Do you have a plan B ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday always seems better to me than today. I've always felt this way. <endOfText>
<human> That is no good!  Why have you been feeling so sad and depressed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember my first time driving a ferrari. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been so cool to drive around in a ferrari. Was it fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wanted a friend to help me to move to my new apartment but he didn't help me as he said. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! He doesn't seem like such a good friend then. I hate it when friends pull stuff like that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I came out of the store I saw that someone had hit my car. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Did you call the police? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I came back from my vacation, I was horrified when I found that there is a rat in my garden. <endOfText>
<human> That is so scary. Did he destroy anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've always tried to be loyal and trustworthy to my wife and daughters. <endOfText>
<human> Most people do not possess those qualities these days.  That is quite honorable of you.  Being faithful is quite important! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma is 93 and needs a lot of assistance with everyday tasks. I try to look after her as best as I can. <endOfText>
<human> I understand, my parents are 85 and 88, both with dementia. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt ready for the test today. I had studied more than I thought was possible over the weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Sounds like you will be successful then! I think you will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting for my blood test results. I am very stressed about it. <endOfText>
<human> That must be very difficult to have to wait for results. I hope they come back and everything is fine though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have seemingly gotten everything in life that I have wanted or needed. I am quite happy with how things have turned out. <endOfText>
<human> That's so great!  You seem quite content. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad's wife asked me to give her back the glassware she gave us at our wedding. <endOfText>
<human> That's interesting.  Why on Earth would she want it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think things will get better in the future. Thats all im hanging on to at the moment. <endOfText>
<human> I'm in that boat right now too. I feel it's going to be a long time coming. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm very proud of my two daughters. They are the light of my life. <endOfText>
<human> I dont have any kids. I want to adopt one day. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember when I was a kid we use to play all day until the streetlights came on. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, it was fun...and so free. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm pretty happy with my home life right now. <endOfText>
<human> There is nothing better than being content. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last month, I saw a pedestrian in front of me been hit by car. Since then, I am very afraid to cross the street. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yikes! That is a scary thing to witness. It is good to be safe these days with so many people using phones while driving and even walking. It is dangerous out there and you never know what can happen to you at any moment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I robbed my coworker wallet last week. I feel bad about it. I needed the money for my addiction to drugs. <endOfText>
<human> That's not good!  Have you considered going to rehab? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked out of the grocery store yesterday after checking out and realized the stuff on the bottom of the cart wasn't paid for. <endOfText>
<human> What did you? Did you return to the store? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really pulling for England during the world cup. Bummer they lost. <endOfText>
<human> Did you have any money bet on it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've just about lost my destructive parents now. <endOfText>
<human> Not quite sure I get what youre saying. Lost as in missing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking in an outdoor mall area last weekend and tripped in front of a bunch of people. I didn't hurt anything, but I was definitely red in the face. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, it happens to the best of us. I have done the same a gazillion times! It doesn't get any better or funnier, lol. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very happy when I found that I am getting a bonus from my employer. <endOfText>
<human> Was it a large one ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm getting a raise in feb. I wish it would hurry up and come. <endOfText>
<human> That is great. Is it a big one? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was travelling India last year. I came across a man lying on ground with his face covered in blood and flies in his mouth. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, wow, that is absolutely terrible! I can imagine it was horrifying for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was he dead, or just injured badly? I wouldn't be sure what to really do either. <endOfText>
<human> I actually dont know. I assumed he was alive. I was mostly shocked that no one seemed to care. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was cleaning out a bin and came across my parents wedding rings. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! That is not a good sign! Do you think they are going to call it quits? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They passed away about 8 years ago so it was just a memory that I came across of them. <endOfText>
<human> It is good to have these kinds of keep sakes. Maybe the rings can even be used again in a family wedding. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to Boston in a couple weeks! I have never been and am really excited and looking forward to it! <endOfText>
<human> that sounds like it is going to be a super trip, you'll have a blast <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was beyond difficult for me when I lost my parents. <endOfText>
<human> Yes, death is always a tough thing to deal with especially when they are close like parents. But that life and every single person on this planet will have to deal with that at some point in life. It is just the nature of life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's the nature for sure, but until it happens do you realize just how painful it is even years later when all you want to do is pick up the phone to ask them what they did today. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, what a bad pain to carry. I hope that you are happy though. Your parents will want you to always stay happy.They are in a better place now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbors got a new puppy yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, how cute! I love animals, especially puppies! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We thought we were going to have to replace our heat pump, but the technicians were able to repair it. <endOfText>
<human> That's good. I know it's very expensive to replace that part, so I'm sure you are relieved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I was swimming with my daughter in the gated community pool, and some guy asked to get in and that he had " forgot his access card " to unlock the gate. <endOfText>
<human> That would make me nervous! you never know what kind of person it could be, a predator perhaps. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Exactly what I was thinking since he didnt have his card, but also was wearing jeans and a bookbag! Nothing that one would wear or bring to a pool. <endOfText>
<human> True! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I started planting a new garden. I should see something growing soon. <endOfText>
<human> That is always a great feeling! I love gardening! What did you plant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The weather is terrible here today and its has me down in the dumps myself. <endOfText>
<human> The weather is terrible here also. I hate that. Are you on the east side of America? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was up all night teething, and I made sure to give her extra cuddles to comfort her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is a tough period. Poor baby! But with mammas love everything is alright. You are such a great mother! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is so tough but the most we can do is let them know we love them, and will be there for them. Thanks! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, hopefully they have invented something that helps with the pain for the teething. Hopefully is is natural. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I invested my saving in the stock market and lost it all. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! That's terrible. What made you choose that stock, and what will you do now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been practising karate for a while, and recently I had a fight for another belt. I trained so hard for it. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Did you win your fight. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is part of his school soccer team. He is very skilled. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! I love soccer. I grew up in Scotland, where everyone's golf and soccer crazy. How old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I spilled a drink all over my lap and had to go out in public like that, talk about wanting to hide in a cave. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!! I hope it wasn't coffee! Yes that is pretty embarrassing. People probably thought you peed your pants. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thankfully no that would have been awful hot - but thats happened before! Yeah thats exactly how I felt honestly. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, well hopefully you learned some kind of lesson from this and it won't happen again. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate at a very popular restaurant in my city last night. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah. Was the food good? What about the service? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was driving the other day on a lane highway and a truck was tailgating me, flashing lights, and honking. I was already going 10 over the speed limit and it's not like I could get over. <endOfText>
<human> I hate aggressive drivers. They cause the majority of the accidents. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I shot a roll on 35mm film. I was very excited to see the results. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like fun. What were you taking pictures of? I didn't know film existed anymore lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Since I broke up with my girlfriend, I feel bad been alone. <endOfText>
<human> First Im sorry for your heartbreak, but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> First Im sorry for your heartbreak, but second... its okay to be alone to let the feelings pass. How long has it been? <endOfText>
<human> It is recent. It has been two months now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My debts will all be gone in a few weeks, and I cant wait to feel that feeling! <endOfText>
<human> That is great. What is it a big amount that you had to pay back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> huge amount, and would have taken years to fully paid off just overwhelming to even know i was ind ebt <endOfText>
<human> I hate having debts.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend that is very helpful. When never I need him, he is here to help. <endOfText>
<human> Awe, that is a very good friend to have. You are very lucky to have a friend like that. Hopefully you are there for him too. :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just finished a class so that I can get my real estate license. <endOfText>
<human> That's great. It really feels great when we accomplish something and reach our goals. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had just moved into my new apartment complex and my neighbor asked to borrow my gate card so I let her. <endOfText>
<human> That was nice of you. I hope she gave it back to you when you needed to use it yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She did! I usually help people out until they give me a reason not to. <endOfText>
<human> That is very kind of you. There needs to be more people like you in the world! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, knew I could count on him though. <endOfText>
<human> And did he pull through? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to Hershey Park with the kids this summer. <endOfText>
<human> Did you all have a good time there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used the internet to help me write a paper once because I didn't read the literature. It was flagged for plagiarism. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my...You have to be careful when you use the internet for school assignments. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love waking up late on the weekends and just feeling like everything's great! <endOfText>
<human> Weekends are beautiful if you don't work on them and have nothing to do! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in Kiev last year walking back to my hostel. Two drunk men started following me. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds very scary, what happened?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That sounds very scary, what happened? <endOfText>
<human> I was a little bit worried. I found some people waiting at a bus stop and sat with them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Smart move honestly, better to be with a larger group than to be alone. Glad you are ok. <endOfText>
<human> Me too. I didnt know what they were up to. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend always gets everything before me. I swear, everything from me wanting a certain car to wanting a baby and she always gets it before me. <endOfText>
<human> How are you still friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I question it to because no one else makes me feel like they intentionally do things like this. <endOfText>
<human> I have a few friends who are way better off than I am. It makes me a bit sad about my situation.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched some family members play basketball recently and my little cousin is impressive. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool! Maybe he will be the Magic Johnson of the family. Hey you never know! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some old pictures a few weeks back and they made me think about my childhood. <endOfText>
<human> It's great looking through old photo albums and remembering all those great times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a party at a friends house and I spilled a drink on the floor. <endOfText>
<human> Hey it happens to the best of us. Were you able to clean it up well? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister just had her first baby. <endOfText>
<human> That's great to hear. Was it a boy or a girl? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few weeks ago, I had to have some repair work done in my bathroom, what they found surprised me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh really?! What did they find? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a huge spider in my room last night! It was so terrifying! <endOfText>
<human> I hate spiders. There is nothing worse than waking up and seeing one above you on the ceiling as you are laying in bed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was staying at a hostel and someone forgot their nice pair of sunglasses. I took it. <endOfText>
<human> And how did you feel about taking another person's forgotten belongings? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have big trip coming up to California. I have never been before so I am getting a little antsy. <endOfText>
<human> sounds like it going to be an interesting trip <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a very good grade on my final exam, I am looking forward to go shopping. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I fail to see the relevance between having a good grade and shopping however. Are you being rewarded for your grades? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I blamed my oldest son for losing my headphones but I found out later I was the one that lost them. <endOfText>
<human> Was he using it or something? Why did you think it was him, and how did you find out it was you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You have a secret spot for your headphones. Are they super expensive? <endOfText>
<human> I have a secret spot for stuff I don't want my kids to find and break lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have zero kids. I break stuff all the time. <endOfText>
<human> Ha Ha you're kind of like a kid then lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the Grand Canyon for the first time during winter. It was breathtaking. <endOfText>
<human> I've never been there. I think it would be intimidating. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats sounds cool. Im more of an independent traveler. I try to avoid guides. <endOfText>
<human> Im the same, but I think in a place like the grand canyon, it's really dangerous to try to go down there alone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a huge job interview coming up. The position is perfect for me so I should do really well in the interview. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck. I hope you do really well during the interview. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the mall with my neice, suddenly she started to cry, she lost her purse with all her money. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no that's terrible! Did you end up finding her purse? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This maniac cut me off on my way to the doctor yesterday. I had to swerve around them and I wrecked into the ditch. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dear. I am so sorry that happened to you. Were you hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took my dress to the seamstress for alteration. I was given a date to pick it up and to this day it is not ready. <endOfText>
<human> That is so annoying. Did you need it for a special occasion? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandma passed away a few months ago, so we have been going through all her things. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. I lost both my grandparents in the same year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the 90s. I wish I could go back. <endOfText>
<human> I know what you mean. Me too! What was your favorite part about the 90s? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went shopping with my mom and sisters. My mom paid for my sisters' items but she did not pay for mine. <endOfText>
<human> How come? Is your sister a minor and are you an adult? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a stranger once. He asked me for a ride to the store. <endOfText>
<human> That could be creepy depending on the person. I'm extra paranoid though. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently started training my dog to improve his obedience. I have a way to go but I've been getting better. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Consistency is key! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was in Walmart and my son pulled a few items off the shelf. Everyone was looking and whispering. <endOfText>
<human> Kids like touching and looking at things, I'm sure no real harm was done. People like making a big deal out of everything. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my first time taking the DMV test. I went there rather early and I aced the test. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you. How did it feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very happy, I went there with my dad, he was happy too. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a great experience <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go to a new doctor last week. I was a little nervous and unsure going in <endOfText>
<human> I am usually that way, whenever I have a doctor's appointment. I hope everything went well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I haven't made a home cooked meal in a long time. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that's a shame - cooking's such fun. Why did you stop cooking? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Excuse me? Seeing my old school really brought back a lot of good memories. <endOfText>
<human> It's weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless. It's nice you had a good experience seeing your school.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It's weird the way some things from our past seem so timeless. It's nice you had a good experience seeing your school. <endOfText>
<human> It really was. I will always remember those times. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thought my best friend was going to be able to visit me this summer. But it turns out he can't take the time off from work right now. I'm a bit bummed, as I haven't seen him in a long time. <endOfText>
<human> Would you be able to go meet him instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, unfortunately I can't make the drive right now. Maybe next year. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. I would be disappointed also. Hopefully yall can make some time soon to get together. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I applied for a job at a new law firm. <endOfText>
<human> Did you get any news back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My and John broke up a few weeks back and he moved out now it is hard to stay in my apartment. <endOfText>
<human> sorry to here that, it must be tough for you at this moment <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time of the year makes me think of my dad. He loved football <endOfText>
<human> Oh my dad loves football too. I bet you have some great memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week while watching my kids play outside, i get so relaxed. <endOfText>
<human> Do you have a patio or backyard to do that in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied hard for the test. I am quite sure that I will get every question correct. <endOfText>
<human> You must have been really prepared to be so certain of achieving a perfect score! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes i am. I studied really hard <endOfText>
<human> I hope you do get that perfect score, you deserve it after all! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was invited to a kids bithday party today. <endOfText>
<human> That is really neat do you have a kid? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My pet iguana died he was 15 years old.. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! Is that old for an iguana? Im sorry to hear that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Not really they can live to be 40 years old. He was nice he loved to just hangout with me and sit on me desk and watch me type. <endOfText>
<human> My daughter wants an iguana. I am scared of animals  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> They are really sweet  creatures, if you live in a sunny climate they make great pets. One tip is if you want a male get is as young as possible, they have  a hard time forming bounds the older they get <endOfText>
<human> She is . She may be able to handle it on her own. Thanks for the info <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter wants an iguana. I am scared of animals <endOfText>
<human> They are really sweet  creatures, if you live in a sunny climate they make great pets. One tip is if you want a male get is as young as possible, they have  a hard time forming bounds the older they get  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While I was at the grocery store I was in line behind a nice, but very confused older person who had trouble getting their credit card to work. <endOfText>
<human> That can be frustrating. Did you do anything to help? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, I thought the cashier was going to help her, but instead, she started getting very frustrated and began saying some very mean and ugly things to the customer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is terrible, cashiers should have more patience. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my brother's last piece of birthday cake, knowing he really wanted it. <endOfText>
<human> Was the cake that good, or were you trying to make him angry? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A homeless person begged me for money the other day. <endOfText>
<human> I guess he really need it. Did you give him the money?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't sure if I should give it to him because I didn't want him to spend it on drugs or something, but I did end up giving him 2 dollars. <endOfText>
<human> Well, at least you gave him something. He could buy a burger at McDonald's <endOfText>

<human> I dislike people who do that. I never understood why! Have you tried talking to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looking at facebook memories are a fun part of my day. <endOfText>

<human> Is it your birthday? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a good feeling tonight is going to be fun. I am going to an event <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I went to the casino last night. <endOfText>
<human> How did you end up doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was promised a big cuddly bear from my friend for my birthday. I was looking forward to the bear but I did not get it. <endOfText>
<human> What did he get you instead? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He didn't get me anything, he said he was short on cash. <endOfText>

<human> There you go, it is the thought that counts. <endOfText>

<human> That is not cool at all. Why would he say that? Maybe he misplaced it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I read a book the other day and it made me feel all warm inside. <endOfText>
<human> I love good books, what was it about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sat on the porch last night and relaxed. I was more than okay with it <endOfText>

<human> Uh oh. Do you think it is something major? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yeah, it's an engine thing, so it may well be some really bad news. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> That's fantastic! Hopefully you'll hear something about it soon. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My cat passed away the other day. <endOfText>
<human> How old was it ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always feel like my life is harder than most. <endOfText>
<human> Why do you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was surprised that the Browns managed to beat the Eagles the other day, I was shocked the beat the superbowl champions <endOfText>
<human> Are you a browns fan ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been trying to get myself into a better position to handle problems from. <endOfText>
<human> What problems do you need to handle? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to have faith in cops.  But whenever I hear about an unarmed civilian shooting or police brutality I lose faith in the law <endOfText>
<human> I do understand what you are saying. There are good cops and bad cops. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking outside and I stepped into a pile of dog faeces. <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait till tonight. I am going to a tattoo event <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> There was a time in my life when I was having financial difficulties. <endOfText>
<human> Happens to the best of us <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did well at my job interview yesterday. I went in feeling confident <endOfText>
<human> That is the best way to feel during an interview. Im sure you did a good job. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am leaving in two days for a three month vacation. I have everything already packed and planned out. <endOfText>
<human> Where are you going <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time, when I was a kid my mom almost drove us off a high bridge, by accident. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! How traumatizing! Were you scared at that time?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't have time to be scared. She was busy yelling at me and not paying attention. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man, I think your mother regretted that after knowing she almost hurt her family. That is quite awful to think about. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow! How traumatizing! Were you scared at that time? <endOfText>
<human> I didn't have time to be scared. She was busy yelling at me and not paying attention.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am appreciative of my family, they are very nice to me and make me feel loved <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  What was the last thing they did for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be really open and honest about my feelings around other people.  Now I keep them to myself and feel a ton better <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I knew I was going to pass my bartender test last month. I studied so hard <endOfText>
<human> congratulations. sounds like you aced it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of my coworkers recently lost her daughter. <endOfText>

<human> That's very sweet of you.  She's going to need her friends to help her through this! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a winning lottery ticket! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! How much did you win? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss watching football with my parents this time of the year. We used to love it <endOfText>
<human> Aw I'm sorry to hear that. I bet you have a lot of good memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally droped a dumbell on my toe at the gym. I felt so freaking stupid. <endOfText>
<human> Did it hurt though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This time of the year makes me thing of my dad. We loved watching football together <endOfText>
<human> Aw that's cute. Father-son/Father-daughter bonding moments are something I miss out on. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I opened my front door and saw a big snake, I immediately slammed the door and went back in. <endOfText>
<human> That is so scary. I don't know what I would have done, <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just moved out of my parents house into my own apartment. <endOfText>
<human> That must be a wonderful feeling, now you are on your own. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went out to eat at my favorite restaurant last night. <endOfText>
<human> Where did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a teen, I fell in love with my best friends girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sounds dramatic. How did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some bad feelings about it and him for a while, but I got over it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you worked it out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very nervous starting my new job a few months ago <endOfText>
<human> A new job can be a little nerve wracking. Did it get better, once you settled in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A lady sitting at the slot machine next to me won $600 <endOfText>
<human> I wish I was that lucky! I always lose. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my accounting class over the summer. I now have to retake it setting me back a little. Im a little bummed out. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks. Did you have a hard time with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend is going to Tahiti with his family! I wish so bad that I could afford to go there! <endOfText>
<human> You could always start saving now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have high hopes for tonight. I am going on a date <endOfText>

<human> Wow that is a predicament  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is, I pretended as if I had no idea what she was talking about. <endOfText>
<human> That was probably a good idea <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Wow that is a predicament <endOfText>
<human> It is, I pretended as if I had no idea what she was talking about.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I were out to dinner with some coworkers of mine and my husband farted right in the middle of it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! That is so funny. Was he really embarrassed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I was more embarrassed than he was! <endOfText>
<human> I can understand that. But its still really funny. My husband is the one to get more embarrassed over things like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I always wake up before my two year old. I love to just cuddle her and look at her while she sleeps. It makes me so happy. <endOfText>
<human> Awww! Sounds like you're a great parent! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I couldnt imagine doing anything else with my life. <endOfText>
<human> I hope I can be a mom someday! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting on results from a big test I took last week. <endOfText>
<human> How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was very lonely before I met my girlfriend and close friends <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you met someone. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone has knocked on my door in the middle of the night the past two nights. It is kind startling and scary. <endOfText>

<human> awesome, whens' the first date? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking into a meeting at work and fell flat on my face. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch! Did you trip over a cord? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My sister talked me into going on a roller coaster with her. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah? I'm guessing you're not a big fan of roller coasters? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the casino with my spouse, lo and behold I won a large amount of money. <endOfText>
<human> That's great!  Did you win it on a table game or at a machine? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my boyfriend took my debit card again <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> Not for a long time. I was pretty upset, and wished it was me. <endOfText>

<human> I hope you have a great time! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend makes stupid and impulsive decisions and often gets himself into trouble.  But I still look out for him <endOfText>
<human> You are a loyal friend. I do hope your friend will learn from his mistakes. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> As a new manager at my job, I really like working there, it has a lot of benefits. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool. What kind of benefits <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a vacation to the Bahamas coming up and I've been spending the past week packing all my belongings. <endOfText>
<human> Bahamas is a nice Caribbean island, you must be really looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been living on my own and my dad paid three months rent in advance for me. <endOfText>
<human> That was so nice of him! <endOfText>

<human> what did you end up doing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, it was so sad <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Death is never easy to deal with. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This guy called from the phone company demanding my info on the phone <endOfText>
<human> How odd. Sounds like a scam. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think my daughter is going to always like school. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good thing. A lot of people (like me!) hate/hated it. She'll do so much better if she's happy. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been collecting supplies for this hurricane season. I am as ready as I'll ever be for whatever comes my way! <endOfText>
<human> That's a good idea. It's best to be prepared for a dangerous weather situation, as you never know when it can happen. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I start a new job on monday. I'm sure I'll do great. <endOfText>
<human> I feel sure as well, you are clearly determined and intentional. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I heard a coworker talking down on welfare and other social support. I was offended but decided to hold my tongue. <endOfText>
<human> Pro's and Con's.  Those systems are abuse prone but, some people need them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All the family members of my house left to visit grandma. No one is home with me. <endOfText>
<human> Why didn't you go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm waking up everyday feeling like my life is getting more and more on track toward my goals.  It's pretty great <endOfText>
<human> That should be an awesome feeling. I do wish you all the best in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get annoyed by my brothers sometimes, but that is life I guess <endOfText>
<human> How come? What do your brothers do to annoy you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home from vacation to find that my home had been broken into. <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible. Did the police find them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the casino just to eat yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I love eating at casino's. They have some of the best food. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get annoyed by my brothers, they can really get on my nerves <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it happens my little bro drives me crazy sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom just called and told my my grandma has cancer <endOfText>
<human> Wow I am so sorry to hear that, my grandmother passed from cancer about 10 years ago <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid I was fat and ashamed about it.  So I worked out and got ripped and now I feel better about myself <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. You must have a nice body and I am glad that you feel better about yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog passed away a few days ago, we had him since he was a baby. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that RIP <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> My roommate ate all of my leftovers last night that I was going to take to work for lunch today. <endOfText>
<human> Wow, what are you going to do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday was my sister's birthday and I totally forgot to call her until today <endOfText>
<human> Was she upset! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad at how the Eagles played the other day, they lost to the browns <endOfText>
<human> What sport is that?  Sorry but I don't know anything about it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to pick up my car from the mechanic and found a huge scratch on the side! They are saying they didn't do it! I am so mad right now! <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh. I am not surprised they denied any wrong doing. I think that is typical of mechanics. What do you plan to do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to drive up to visit my family on Monday. I am pretty excited! <endOfText>
<human> That sounds great!  Have you not seen them in a while? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my sister about a month ago. But I haven't seen anyone else since February. <endOfText>
<human> It will be good to catch up with them!  Family is all that matters. <endOfText>

<bot> <bot> I have been loyal to my girlfriend of almost 3 years now <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! It always warms my heart to hear about a happy loyal companionship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had some fried chicken yesterday <endOfText>
<human> I can't say I'm a huge fan of fried chicken. Did you enjoy it at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We used to live in Hawaii. Only a couple of blocks from Waikiki beach. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that must have been lovely. How was it living in paradise? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I know many people are already suffering for climate change but I believe if politicians take the right measures now, we can still save the planet <endOfText>
<human> I could not agree more with you. but it seems like a lot of politicians either don't care or are not putting enough resources into combating climate change. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> MY friend is having a party for her two year old. <endOfText>
<human> Aww that is sweet are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just had a son and Last night he woke up crying. I went in to hold him and in that moment it clicked that im a dad now <endOfText>
<human> Awww. I remember that feeling with my first kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my daughter I would watch a scary movie with her tongiht <endOfText>

<human> I used to love them. I cant believe that are still performing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the movie with a friend, apparently he saw the movie before and kept chatting and telling me what's going to happen next in the movie. <endOfText>
<human> i hate when someone does that, it can be so annoying :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone threw a bunch of empty beer cans in my truck bed. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my family, they have never let me down <endOfText>
<human> Its always good to have solid family members.  Not everyone has that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've deployed overseas twice in my lifetime, leaving my wife to care for her own. <endOfText>
<human> I bet you hate having to leave and I am sure she misses you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom told me to pick my little brother up from daycare after I got out of school. <endOfText>
<human> She must have a lot of faith in you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to change jobs lately, but I am now not sure about my decision. <endOfText>
<human> Are your not liking your new job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel kind of alone now. I dont hang out with friends much <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry you are feeling lonely.   Why don't you see your friends much anymore, are you all to busy> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old box of toys from my childhood in the attic. Talk about blast from the past! Such good memories! <endOfText>
<human> Wow what kind of toys did you find <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got home from work the other day and the entire house was spotless <endOfText>
<human> Nice! Would you like to send the cleaning fairy round to my place?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just put in a bid for a house that I really want! I am praying I get it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that must be exciting! Is this your first home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found an old RC car I had when I was a kid in the closet. <endOfText>
<human> Does it still work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I drank my roommates beer last night. I feel pretty bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty rude.  Are you going to buy him some more beer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was walking and leaned down and ripped my pants <endOfText>
<human> Wow did anyone see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like too see pictures of my kids when they were babies, but it always made me cry a little remembering the all times <endOfText>
<human> You are exactly like me. Those were the good old days <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going back to school next week. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds exciting!, are you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> All my life I have wanted to be a mom. I finally got the opportunity. <endOfText>

<human> That is great news!  You must be really proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I am, I took him to Chucky Cheese in order to celebrate <endOfText>
<human> That is good positive reinforcement!  Congrats to your kid! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I watched the new Black Panther movie last night. I was a little let down by the story though. It needed more development. <endOfText>
<human> Okay, I am sorry that it was not up to your standard. I have not seen it as yet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So I went back to college a few years ago after having dropped out nearly 20 years prior. <endOfText>
<human> How does that make you feel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Since I'm self-employed I'm always expecting new opportunities for increasing my income.  It feels good to be financially independent <endOfText>
<human> Oh cool!  I bet it's also nice not having a boss breathing down your neck, right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I almost drowned when I was little.  I was more embarrassed than scared to be honest <endOfText>
<human> That sounds horrible!  Good thing you are all right and only walked away with a little shame! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My toilet backed up in my house last weekend! I was so grossed out! <endOfText>
<human> I would be too haha...whos fault was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a family on their porch while I was out on my morning jog. It made me think about when my daughter still lived at home. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool that you're active.  Does she go to college or what <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, she graduated a couple years ago and now she has an apartment. <endOfText>
<human> Gotcha.  I make sure to call my mom at least twice a week, I'm 26 and I've got my own apartment as well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was an awkward teenager and was super scared to talk to girls..now I'm getting numbers left and right it's pretty great <endOfText>
<human> That's really awesome, I'm happy for your success and encourage you to enjoy yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just won $300 dollars on a scratch off ticket. It feel really good. I can pay some bills with it. <endOfText>
<human> That is wonderful news. That is a lot of money to win. I am happy for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a scratch off ticket and won $50.00 I usually lose my money but this time I won. Lucky me. <endOfText>
<human> Amazing. Those things seem to never pay out. That is a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proud of the eagles for winning the superbowl last year <endOfText>
<human> I'm a Boston boy but I gotta give em props <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't go out looking for trouble.  But if some stranger disrespects me in public I'm always ready to knock his ass out <endOfText>
<human> That is good, that is what we hit the gym for right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A co-worker of my husband asked me out on a date. I think that was rude and I told him no. <endOfText>
<human> That could be awkward. I wonder what made him feel he could do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Playing the WII with my little brother was so frustrating...he would beat me in boxing and tennis and I would be so mad I'd keep asking for another round haha <endOfText>
<human> I know the feeling, my little nephew used to beat me at Mortal Kombat constantly just by button smashing. How did your little brother get so good at Wii? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get emotional about my family and friends sometimes, I am lucky to have them for sure <endOfText>
<human> Nothing wrong with being emotional. It's healthy. I get a bit emotional about that stuff too. Family and friends are extremely important. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> An elderly friend of mine gave me one thousand dollars to keep for him. <endOfText>
<human> He must trust you a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I trust my wife blindly <endOfText>
<human> That is nice. we are suppose to trust our spouses. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was a story about a duck being a mother to 76 ducklings.  It was so sweet. <endOfText>
<human> That is a lot of kids, imagine raising that many kids! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was heartbroken when my grandmother passed away, I am still not over it <endOfText>
<human> I am so very sorry for your loss.  I lost my mom last year. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my last cash and I went into Subway bought a sandwich came out and it fell from my hands. <endOfText>
<human> OH no. Were you still at subway? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cant believe my paycheck is gone already <endOfText>
<human> What happened? You had too many bills to pay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am learning how to wake-board this weekend! I am really nervous though! <endOfText>
<human> What is wake-board. That sounds a bit scary. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really miss my man. He went on a business trip to Europe so I am here in his shirt. <endOfText>
<human> That no good!  How long will he be gone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I want to take my kids to a buffet today <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Hopefully they eat a lot of food! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I made an A in all three of my summer courses. I must say that I even surprised myself. <endOfText>
<human> You must be very proud of yourself. I am proud of you. You are a star. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been trying to purchase a car but my credit is so bad. I even tried to repair it but to no avail. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes it just takes a time and you need to stay proactive. I know it can be disappointing.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes it just takes a time and you need to stay proactive. I know it can be disappointing. <endOfText>
<human> It is like the more I try the harder it is to be repaired. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a little kid I used to watch "The Nighmare Before Christmas" with my parents all the time....saw it again just the other day reminded me of my family <endOfText>
<human> I think I have seen that movie <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love looking at old family albums <endOfText>
<human> Do you miss your family <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter just competed in her first dance competition. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how exciting! How did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> She got first place! And she was eve competing against much older girls. <endOfText>
<human> Amazing, you must feel really proud! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am proposing tomorrow! <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! How exciting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wasn't able to make rent this month. <endOfText>
<human> Ohh man, I am so sorry.  I have had that happen to me many times over the last five years.  Did you contact your landlord? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a kitten in the bushes, I took it home tried to find its owner. No one claimed her so I took her in. <endOfText>
<human> That was really nice of you!  You must have a really caring heart! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going on my first roller coaster ride at Universal Studios next week and am scared out of my mind! <endOfText>
<human> I have never been on a roller coaster. I would be very scared too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day I rescue and abandoned dog on the street, and took care of him until we found him a new home. <endOfText>
<human> Awww that is so sweet. Did he go to a good home? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate and best friend just moved out. <endOfText>
<human> How are you feeling about it?  Are you sad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm optimistic about my future.  Being self-employed with tons of ideas coming to me everyday makes me feel pretty confident that I'll be straight balling in no time <endOfText>
<human> I bet you will be balling. I hope you remember the poorer folks like me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I will.  Just send me your bank account details and I'll keep it on the back burner ;) <endOfText>
<human> That sounds grand :) it's a deal I am rooting for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I remember the first time I went to the movie. It was with my friends and I was eager to go. <endOfText>
<human> And what movie did you guys see <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am hoping for a raise with my evaluation next week.  Fingers crossed.  It was a good year though. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! I am sure that it will go well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just got a new puppy last week and now he's dead. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh.  I am so sorry.  What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This weekend was very stressful at work, but I have been able to relax during the weekend and read good books. <endOfText>
<human> That is good, reading always relaxes me too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put in an application for a new home and I am really wishing to get it! <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting!   How long will it take before they give you and answer? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Man the Patriots let me down last year...but gotta give the Eagles props they came ready <endOfText>
<human> Ah a Patriots fan. Sorry about that, but they've been so great in the past, you should feel pride in that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to my daughter's awards ceremony at school recently. <endOfText>
<human> How was that experience for you <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was really wonderful seeing her go up for so many awards. <endOfText>
<human> You must have been proud.  But she wouldn't be there if you didn't persistently push her to do her best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to get nervous and anxious whenever someone would try to start a fight or argument with me...now I don't ever back down, and it helps I've been boxing and wrestling for 5 years <endOfText>
<human> I am glad to hear that. It can take a lot for some people to be confident like that. I am glad you got over your issues with it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kid lied to me yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> I've had that happen before.  Its like they are trying to become professionals at it. Was it a whopper? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my husband that I was going to see a friend when I didn't. I went to a party planner's place. <endOfText>
<human> Are you going to have a surprise party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day at work when I was in the elevator I realized I had an extra-button from my shirt unbuttoned, <endOfText>
<human> Oh geez, I know how that is. How long do you think it had been that way? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a kid I almost drowned so I would be nervous getting in the pool...but since my parents put me in swimming lessons I gained confidence and even joined the swim team <endOfText>
<human> Wow, good for you finding the courage to overcome your fear! I can understand why you were nervous after what you went through. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to swim competitively when I was a kid. I started around 4th grade. <endOfText>
<human> That is great.  Do you still swim? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No not anymore. I wish I did but I have gotten kind of lazy since those days. <endOfText>
<human> Well you can start slowly, I'm sure you will find your motivation again <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't wait for my new nephew to be born, it should happens at any moment <endOfText>
<human> That is so exciting! I love babies. Do you know what his name will be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tried my mother in law's cooking for the first time the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Soooo how was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Chinese New Year in Hong Kong was always a happy time.  I spent 2 years there cuz of my dad's job and we would go see the parade with dancing dragons and live music, it was pretty sweet <endOfText>
<human> Crazy, was it like the movies? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a guy at the mall wearing a cut off tank top like you used to see in the 80's except he was 400 pounds. <endOfText>
<human> Lmao sounds like a confident dude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> McDonald's used to be my go-to when my college friends and I got drunk...now I'm scared to even touch it haha <endOfText>
<human> I hear you.  I still love the McNuggets, but I never eat them since I went Vegan. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I took a helicopter ride for a date one time and the helicopter malfunctioned. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness!  What happened?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I was driving down my local highway when suddenly a car pulled right out in front of me! <endOfText>
<human> Did you crash!? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend have recently been spending a lot of time with some people from her work. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks.  I always feel left out when that happens to me.  Even more so when I know the people from my best friend's work so when I can't be involved, its hard.  How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had an intruder three nights ago who went through all out stuff while we were sleeping and ransacked our basement. <endOfText>
<human> How terrifying!  Did the intruder took anything or was he just some kind of creep? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I told my best friends secret to another one of our friends. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you do it?  Do you now feel bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've trained very hard, so I believe I will be fine in a 5k race I have next week <endOfText>
<human> Well if you trained as hard as you stated, I am sure you will do great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wake up every morning and I'm just amazed at the man I am.  Like, you've come pretty far Buddy keep shooting for the moon...cuz I used to be a worthless deadbeat <endOfText>
<human> That's whats up! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope you never have kidney stones, but I have had several.  A month ago, I had to have surgery because one was lodged and was too big to pass. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, that sounds so painful!  No I have never have them.  Do you know you can avoid them in the future? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No, I wish I did.  But, in spite of all that, I have such an awesome wife.  She took care of me post-surgery.  For over two weeks, she was so considerate and helpful to all my needs.  I was down, but she really helped me. <endOfText>
<human> That is great that your wife took such great care of you!   I hope you are now feeling completely recovered. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a small party at my house last night and didn't invite my best friend. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, really?  Was something wrong?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, really?  Was something wrong? <endOfText>
<human> No, I just though she wouln't get along with the other people I had, but I still feel bad I didn't even tell her about the party. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone keyed my new car yesterday at work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did you find out who? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to go and take a test in order to get certified, and I was feeling really good about it. I have been studying for days <endOfText>
<human> What are you getting certified for?  It seem that you were weel prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a magic show last week. The magician was really talented. <endOfText>
<human> That's cool.  Was he better than Cris Angel <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I thank God everyday for having big balls...moved to South TX after living in MN for 15 years with my parents, no friends family or connection...and now I'm fully self employed living the dream every day <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! It takes a lot of courage to move away from home like that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Totally.  Used to work a 9-5 job that I hated and that's over too.  Life just keeps getting better and better <endOfText>
<human> It's great that you're so positive about life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband comes home tomorrow from a month long business trip! I am so excited and cleaning the house and getting things all ready! <endOfText>
<human> Oh you are such a great wife! I think he will totally appreciate it! Are you doing anything nice for him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a surgery coming up on Monday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Are you scared at all? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had surgery a few weeks ago. It was tough, but my friends really helped out. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, what did you have surgery for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to take a test to see if I can get certified and I feel really confident. I cant wait! <endOfText>
<human> Great! I'm sure you've prepared a lot for it. Good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to the beach tomorrow and I believe I have packed everything we will be needing there. <endOfText>
<human> Oh how exciting! I love the beach! Are you bringing lots of snacks and drinks? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I found my dog chewing my leather loafers. Apparently he thought they were a chew toy. I was livid. <endOfText>
<human> They must have tasted good! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to the gym today to register with a promotion were I was supposed to get 1 free month. But it turned out the promotion was expired. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hate when things like that happen. You can sometimes still get it if you try to speak to the manager <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I accidentally told my best friend's secret to a mutual friend <endOfText>
<human> You must feel awful about it!  What are you going to do?  Are you telling your friend? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to be miserable when no one would hit me up and I'd spend the weekend solo at my parents' house...now I turn off my phone just to keep from getting distracted <endOfText>
<human> That sounds sad.  What are you getting distracted from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> You'll never believe what I did today. <endOfText>
<human> Try me <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was ripped with a six pack I used to feel like I was cheating myself if I had anything with sugar...now I'll eat whatever I want and still be in great shape <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. What changed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoy Toyota cars. You can count on them to take care of you for a while! <endOfText>
<human> I rented a Corolla once.  It had great responsiveness, was speeding like a mofo  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I rented a Corolla once.  It had great responsiveness, was speeding like a mofo <endOfText>
<human> Right. I have a camry! Its an 2007. I have not had any major problem, that the manufactor has paid to fix! Ive had a corolla also! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday something was smelling awful in the kitchen and after a lot of search it turned out that it was some eggs that have rotten over the counter. <endOfText>
<human> Gross!  That must have been disgusting! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday I wasn't paying attention while driving and almost hit a person in a crosswalk.  I felt so bad and knew I was in the wrong. <endOfText>
<human> How scary!   Thank god nothing bad happened after all.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> How scary!   Thank god nothing bad happened after all. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I learned my lesson for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sure miss the days when I was young and living at home. We had a nice house and all I had to do was schoolwork and play with my friends. <endOfText>
<human> True, you must be feeling nostalgic, kids going back to school and all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've struggled with my weight for years and my ability to stick to a diet, but for the past four months I have been very dedicated to a new diet approach! I'm seeing amazing results. <endOfText>
<human> that is awesome. i too have had the same issues. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i sometimes feel badly for the way our clothes and home look <endOfText>
<human> Aww, why's that? Do you live in an older home>? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had someone break into my garage the other day. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no.  Did they do damage or steal anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I completed some tests for qualifications.  I'm anxiously waiting to see if I passed. <endOfText>
<human> Was that for work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Buddy of mine and I had both paid for front row tickets to a concert...I was so mad at myself when we got there and I forgot it back home <endOfText>
<human> Oh that sucks! How far do you live from the venue? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was a young child, I fell off of the slide, but my father caught me before I hit the ground. I knew I could count on my dad after that day. <endOfText>
<human> What a nice story and how wonderful to feel so protected! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting for some blood and other test I have to had last week, because I was not feeling well. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I hope that you get well soon and that the tests come back okay! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Today was a great day. I was able to knock out a bunch of stuff that needed to be done and now I have the rest of the day to relax. Just sitting around with a nice cup of coffee. Very peaceful. <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear, coffee is the bomb! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> At my home we use artificial sweetener instead of sugar in our coffee. I was fixing my mother in law a cup of coffee and it slipped my mind that we don't use sugar and so I handed the cup to her. She ended up spitting coffee everywhere as a reaction. I feel like an idiot. <endOfText>
<human> Did she forgive you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work and my friend left to go to the bathroom and didn't come back for what seemed like 30 minutes! There were so many customers that I had to deal with! <endOfText>
<human> Jeeze, I hope he really had to go, otherwise he must have been slacking off on purpose! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend recently proposed! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, congratulations! That's awesome. When's the wedding? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My little brother took my bike without asking me, and he left it outside the shop, then it got stolen! I'm so angry right now <endOfText>
<human> That was very careless of him, I'm sorry. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last year a hurricane hit my area. Luckily I had planned well and had all the supplies I needed to stay safe. I am always thinking ahead like that. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, I'm glad you were prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I studied for four years at the university. <endOfText>
<human> Cool, what did you study? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am confident I will soon find a well paying job that will allow me to pay my student debt <endOfText>
<human> Those are such high payments, be sure to get your plan based on your income, it really helps. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter got a birthday card full of money this week and I took the cash before she could see it. <endOfText>
<human> Well, that was terrible of you. Why would you do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hurt my neck today. I must have slept on it wrong and my sweet husband gave me a neck massage to help. It was so sweet. <endOfText>
<human> Ouch, I've done that before. But how sweet of him, sounds like a keeper. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> He's the best.  I was able to get up and get cleaning and work done today thanks to him. <endOfText>
<human> Ah, so he had ulterior motives and wanted the chores done! Just kidding. Glad you're feeling better. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my house in a fire last year. All my friends banded together to help me in any way they could think of. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Did they help you find another home/let you stay with them for a while? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the fair the other day and I smelled funnel cakes. It reminded me of home <endOfText>
<human> I love those. That must have brought up some nice memories. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend came home with a brand new car for me, one that I really wanted. <endOfText>
<human> Congrats! Did he choose wisely? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently got the news that my grandfather has cancer. I was so had to hear that because he is a great guy and doesn't deserve it. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear that. That kind of news is always hard to receive. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had not seen my best friend in over 3 years. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. What happened to him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Something smelled really bad at work the other day. We found an old moldy rotting sandwich in a coworkers desk. <endOfText>
<human> Jeez, wonder why they left it there for that long? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a coworker that plays their music so loud I can hear it from their headphones. I keep asking them to turn it down but they keep cranking it back up. <endOfText>
<human> That must make you angry. Can you report him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh so a few weeks ago my 3 year old broke my favorite eyeshadows. <endOfText>
<human> No way!! Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was waiting for a friend to bring some food to the party and they never showed up. I was really sad and we had to go get it ourselves <endOfText>
<human> Every found out why they didn't show up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> While my job doesn't pay a lot, it's very rewarding. I work as a caregiver and it feels  so good to make someone happy. <endOfText>
<human> That must be amazing! I wish I had your job <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So my 4 year old just learned how to spell his name last week. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is cool! I bet you are proud. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am! I've been working so hard with him lately! <endOfText>
<human> It is paying off. That is such a fun age. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My phone is acting up again. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. That sounds annoying. Know what's causing it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone bumped into my car in an intersection and took off. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. A hit and run is terrible <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son struggled all through school with his grades. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortuante. I bet he is good now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My house caught on fire and I lost all my belongings. Im so upset right now. I dont know what I am going to do. <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry. That is horrible. Now what? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just graduated from college. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome. That is a huge accomplishment. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a package in the mail of a purse i wanted and have no idea who it came from. <endOfText>
<human> Wow! That is amazing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at a restaurant and I got a hair in my food! I was appalled! <endOfText>
<human> That's disgusting! Hopefully you got a refund or your food recooked? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My family left today after a long visit to my house. I miss them already and wish I lived near them. <endOfText>
<human> Well hopefully you will see them again soon. I'm sure they will. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I usually see them a couple times a year so maybe near Christmas time.  Its just so quiet and boring now. <endOfText>
<human> You must find joy in your life - something you are passionate about <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was waiting on some pregnancy test results from the doctor. <endOfText>
<human> You must be anxious and excited! Was it expected? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My appointment is next week and my nerves are all over the place <endOfText>
<human> Hope everything goes as planned! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so a while aog my cat went missing and i found her ran over in the road. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. Did you find out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just bought a brand new car, <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! What kind of car is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been dieting really hard for three months now to get ready for a bodybuilding show I have coming up. The results speak for themselves and I think I got this one in the bag! <endOfText>
<human> Where will the show be? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for Christmas!  It is such a happy time! <endOfText>
<human> I love the weather that time of the year. I agree, it is so much fun. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I helped tutor my nephew in algebra. He ended up passing with an A. That made me very happy. <endOfText>
<human> You sound like a great uncle!  You must be proud of him! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I walked into a public restroom then quickly walked out. <endOfText>
<human> i hate to ask why you walked back out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I like to be well ready for a big trip, don't you ? <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I love big trips. I spend hours packing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife just gave birth to our 11th child. <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome! Congratulations. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We just bought a used car and we've already had to take it to the shop <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. Sometimes used cars can be tough to deal with <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One time  i forgot to pay for a candy bar before leaving the store. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I have had that happen to me before, too. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am getting ready to apply to graduate school, and I am feeling a little nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure you'll do great! Have you been preparing? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have, I am getting ready to take my graduate exam in 2 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> Good luck! don't be nervous. I'm sure you'll knock it out of the park! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently had a baby and now none of my friends want to hang out with me anymore. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations!  That's awful!  DO they not have kids themselves?  Its a pretty typical thing to happen when you're the first to have a baby among them and they don't understand that lifestyle. I've been there. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just found out the small company I work for is going out of business. I cried all day Friday when I found out because I love working for them <endOfText>
<human> I am so sorry to hear this. I am sure you will find another job, but it doesn't make it any less painful. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was such a nice night last evening, that my wife, my children, and I all sat on the back porch and simply enjoyed the evening together. <endOfText>
<human> That's sounds like a lovely night. I bet it was wonderful <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Absolutely.  I played my guitar, we sang, we talked, and just enjoyed the night.  God has been good to me.  Life is good. <endOfText>
<human> I love the guitar, too! That's marvelous <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I received a call that my friend was dead,  when I was in an occasion <endOfText>
<human> Oh my goodness. I'm so sorry to hear that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A few years ago when my grandma was in hospice I spent every day with her. <endOfText>
<human> Wow,  you are so caring <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ohhh,  so how is she now? <endOfText>
<human> Oh she passed away. She was in her 90s with congestive heart failure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So i'll be going up for a promotion at work in a few weeks. <endOfText>
<human> That's exciting! I wish you the best of luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I returned home from school one afternoon to news that my dog was run over by a car. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry! You must've been so sad. Did you find out who did it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son will be turning 2 in a few months, I am a little sad about it. <endOfText>
<human> That is bittersweet! What is his name? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My home state was represented in the LLWS! <endOfText>
<human> thats great! what is llws? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My parents just gave me the best birthday present ever. <endOfText>
<human> How exciting! What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so I found a old ring that was passed down to me from my grandmother the other day. <endOfText>
<human> That must have been really exciting.  Did you think you had lost it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, It brought up so many memories. <endOfText>
<human> Were you really close to her? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the promotion at work that I applied for. <endOfText>
<human> That's unfortunate. You will get the next one, I am sure. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I are taking the kids to see my family on Monday. I have been doing laundry and packing so we are ready to go. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds fun! Has it been a while since you seen your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw my sister about a month ago. We havent seen my parents since Christmas time. <endOfText>
<human> I am glad you are getting to see them! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really enjoyed caring for the patients in the emergency room at my previous job. <endOfText>
<human> Are you a nurse? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is having a baby. What do you think would be a nice gift for a newly expecting mother? <endOfText>
<human> A new mom? Good question, maybe offer to mow their lawn? I don't really know haha <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My life is great! <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad. You seem very happy <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend just moved to another state. <endOfText>
<human> Ah that is depressing! What state? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when my wife and son are away from me <endOfText>
<human> I bet it gets lonely <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now. <endOfText>
<human> What is so great? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend was struck by a meteor <endOfText>
<human> Was his name Joe Dirt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> About a year ago I lost my grandmother to cancer. I was really close to her. <endOfText>
<human> I'm so sorry. I recently just lost both of my grandparents within a year. I know how you feel. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate when people get too close to me standing in line <endOfText>
<human> Oh my gosh! Me too. It literally makes my skin crawl.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my gosh! Me too. It literally makes my skin crawl. <endOfText>
<human> Absolutely, a little space would be nice! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son threw a pillow at my daughter while she was eating some pasta. She had on a really cute outfit. Of course it is stained now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Spaghetti sauce is so tough to get out <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It really bothers me when people stand right on top of me in line <endOfText>
<human> Me too. It is a huge pet peeve of mine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my bottoms at the water park, while going down the slide. It was horrible. <endOfText>
<human> Was you way down yonder on the Chattahoochee? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the doctors office waiting for the results of a blood test and I was a little scared <endOfText>
<human> Oh man I HATE waiting on test results! Gets my anxiety to extreme levels. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an older car for my 16th birthday, but my best friend got a BRAND new BMW! Ugh, life is so unfair. <endOfText>
<human> Life is not fair for anybody <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked really hard to get a promotion at work, but my coworker did instead. <endOfText>
<human> Sheesh that is terrible. I would have a hard time not leaving <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boy is growing up so fast, its amazing the things that change daily <endOfText>
<human> That sure do, how old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My neighbor shot my dog and nearly killed him yesterday! All because he pooped on his driveway. I get it, my dog should go somewhere else, but shooting him?! <endOfText>
<human> I would have shot back, that is uncalled for <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a girl from South Korea who has been travelling the world by bicycle alone. She created a blog and has had people support her to continue travelling. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really cool.  Is her Blog very popular? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a friend that has become a millionaire from trading cryptocurrency. <endOfText>
<human> Thats one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it. Now the value has skyrocketed.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thats one of my biggest regrets was not investing in it. Now the value has skyrocketed. <endOfText>
<human> Well they have plummeted back down so you can get in pretty cheap again, but it might not be a good idea at this point. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to a scary corn maze and I got spooked by one of the people in it! <endOfText>
<human> that is bad how did it happen  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> that is bad how did it happen <endOfText>
<human> It wasn't really bad, but a guy jumped out from around the corner. It was really funny afterwords <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my son did a stupid this that let me ashamed <endOfText>
<human> What did he do <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> he assaulted a pastor of our church <endOfText>
<human> Oh my! That is horrible! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yesterday as i was jogging, an elderly man was checking his mail naked <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! I guess he didn't care! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> No hair, no care... <endOfText>
<human> That is the truth, no shame in his game. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I think I have everything ready for graduate school. <endOfText>
<human> Interesting... what are you going for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was doing laundry last night and I saw a huge roach scuttle underneath the washing machine. I shrieked because I hate bugs! <endOfText>
<human> I do, too! I always make my husband kill them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to actually propose to my "husband" soon. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome. I hope he says yes! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at work and when I went to the bathroom, it got really busy and my coworker go overloaded! I feel really bad <endOfText>
<human> Probably didn't last too long when you got back though I'm guessing <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes after i eat, i trust a fart a little too much <endOfText>
<human> Does that mean what I think it means?  have you had a juicy flatulence experience?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> unfortunately all too often <endOfText>
<human> I wonder if there is anything you can do about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Does that mean what I think it means?  have you had a juicy flatulence experience? <endOfText>
<human> unfortunately all too often   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a necklace that my mother gave me before she passed away, but I just lost it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my that is horrible, i hope you find it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone was stealing mail out of my mailbox. <endOfText>
<human> Did they get caught? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The other day while my wife was asleep, i ate her leftovers <endOfText>
<human> What were the leftovers? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Shrimp with friend rice <endOfText>
<human> I enjoy fried rice! I hope she wasn't too upset. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and I found a twenty dollar bill on the ground! I was so happy <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what did you do with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is turning two in a few months and I can't help but think about when he was born. <endOfText>
<human> Any big plans? My son just turned 4. I've been nostalgic also. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> a while back ago I found a tiny baby kitten and decided to take it in and bottle feed it <endOfText>
<human> That is a very nice thing to do! I am a big animal lover.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That is a very nice thing to do! I am a big animal lover. <endOfText>
<human> Me too! I can't stand to see animals suffering. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> indeed i am in a good place <endOfText>
<human> I am so glad to hearit. What's going right in your life? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was trying to get pregnant a few years back, my 15 year old cousin accidentally got knocked up. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, was you able to get pregnant? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend got me concert tickets to see my favorite band. I had no idea she did that for me. I thought the tickets were sold out. <endOfText>
<human> What band? That was very thoughtful or her.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What band? That was very thoughtful or her. <endOfText>
<human> Phoenix. Yea she kept it a secret that she was able to get them when I failed. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really hoping I get accepted into the school counseling program for grad school. <endOfText>
<human> Do you think you have a good shot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandfather gave me his pocket watch <endOfText>
<human> Wow, where did he get it from? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Kazakhstan, in 1948 <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome, glad he's able to hand it down to the next generation <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone broke into our new home, I couldn't believe it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh man that is so scary. Did they steal anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt a lot better in a bathing suit last time I wore one since I lost a little weight. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I am happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really like to watch all  of the old tv shows that were on when I was a kid. I watch them with my kids sometimes. But they usually just make me feel really old when we do this. <endOfText>
<human> That's funny, it's like you can see your kids and see yourself experiencing it when you were a kid <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm so glad my wife and son gets to stay home during the day <endOfText>
<human> That sounds nice! I'm sure they appreciate it a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so tomorrow is my first day at a new job and new career. <endOfText>
<human> Wow how exciting! what do you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I worked really hard to get a promotion at work and I found out yesterday I didn't get it. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sorry. Your boss still knows about the great work you have put in, though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was wearing white shorts the other night to dinner and over trusted a fart <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's actually hilarious. And very unfortunate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Extremely and i was going commando <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's even funnier... But even more unfortunate <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> so this one time in computer class i thought i had a silent fart but it was really loud and everyone heard it <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no. Was it deadly? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was. So rank and so loud. <endOfText>
<human> That is rough. I am glad you made it through. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a big test coming up and I am hoping I do good. <endOfText>
<human> Are you nervous? I'm sure you'll do great if you prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some old rotten sweet potatoes hiding at the back of my refrigerator. <endOfText>
<human> I find myself not finishing potatoes either! They take so long to cook <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a great job that allows me to stay at home <endOfText>
<human> I could only dream of having that. That must be nice. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out with my guy friends last weekend. A girl approached me and wanted my number but I told her no because I have a girlfriend. <endOfText>
<human> That is faithful, you are a good dude <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I puked and passed out at the bar last night <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! Were you alone? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our home was broken into. <endOfText>
<human> Fluff that stinks, did you shoot em? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a speeding ticket, but I couldn't even be mad because I was going too fast. <endOfText>
<human> How fast were you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've got a first date in about an hour. <endOfText>
<human> Nice, hope you have fun!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i have a very good feeling about the upcoming football season <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so thankful for everything in my life right now. <endOfText>
<human> That is good. what is going on with it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine just got a new wrangler, i want one bad <endOfText>
<human> Ive been wanting a jeep for myself too! They are so cool <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and I saw a guy carrying like 20 bags! It was amazing! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, must have been shopping with his wife. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Every time I tell my Mom about something my child did that is so neat to me, my sister-in-law chimes in about something her child did to top it. It drives me crazy. <endOfText>
<human> That's funny, likes it's an extension as who they are as a person <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and I dropped my wallet. Luckily some old man picked it up and gave it back to me before I even noticed! <endOfText>
<human> Man that was super lucky, most people would have taken it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a very good feeling about this football season for the Chargers <endOfText>
<human> Really? I dont watch much football <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my debit card and didnt have access to funds. My bank went out of their way to ship it first class back to me free of charge. <endOfText>
<human> that was very nice of them. you werent able to walk into an office and get it faster <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was out of the country. Forgot to mention. Luckily, I had some dollars for emergencies. <endOfText>
<human> oh then that makes sense. good thing they were willing to help <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was looking through old boxes and came across a box full of baby stuff when my twins were super tiny <endOfText>
<human> Wow. Twins. How rare is it to have them? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a fantasy draft today, i researched alot for it <endOfText>
<human> I've never tried that, do you bet money on it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My buddy got slammed last night at the bar <endOfText>
<human> Slammed as in he got really drunk, or slammed as in he got into a fight? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was at the store and it was like I was the only one in there. I felt weird <endOfText>
<human> that is strange, i would have got out of there <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad told me he was going to give me a gift card to a steak house, but he never followed through. <endOfText>
<human> That stinks, did you go anyway? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I put in for a new job, i think i'll get it <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome.  Is it with the same company, or someone different? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I just saw a rattle snake in my back yard. <endOfText>
<human> Cool, what did you do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a movie the other day, it wasnt as good as i was expecting <endOfText>
<human> Which movie did you see? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband and I signed our kids up for a co-op this year. I really hope they enjoy it. <endOfText>
<human> what is co-op? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This co-op is for homeschoolers. Its one day a week where the kids go and learn with other homeschool kids. <endOfText>
<human> Oh that is really neat! i hope they like it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i saw a guy smack his wife at the store, i was furious <endOfText>
<human> Did you do or say anything? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I called into work and told them I was sick, I felt bad afterwards cause it left them short handed. <endOfText>
<human> Were you legit sick? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband started working out only 3 months ago and can already do 90 push ups in a row! Its crazy amazing! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is impressive. Do you work with him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do workout with him. I have a lot of muscle problems so I can only do 20 wall push ups but its a far cry from where I started. <endOfText>
<human> That is still not bad! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am expecting a settlement i cant wait <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Hope something horrible didn't happen to you just to get it.  You getting a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a stray dog today and decided to rescue it. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! What breed? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh ok that is very nice of you <endOfText>
<human> Thanks.  Are you looking for a dog by chance? :) <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a dream i was taken hostage <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty scary.  Was it like a scene from taken? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to go get a snack from the kitchen. I looked all over but they were all gone. The kids ate them all. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, that is irritating sometime! That happens to me sometimes <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is irritating. I guess I need to hide just a few so that I can have a snack once in a while. <endOfText>
<human> Lol. I am guilty of hiding a couple of snacks for myself at times, nothing wrong with that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband once let this guy come to our house so he could use his tools to fix his truck. <endOfText>
<human> How did that go?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was supposed to close on my house this weekend, but the people are refusing to move out! <endOfText>
<human> Wow that is odd, is there nothing you can do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife was asleep and i ate her leftovers <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a win!  Did she get mad? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hit the lottery last week, i am financially set <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. I hope you don't spend it all too quickly. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got a big chemistry exam coming up. I am so worried I will bomb it. <endOfText>
<human> I hated chemistry in school, i hope you do well <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The last time we went on vacation I made sure to overpack so we would have everything we needed. <endOfText>
<human> That's a good idea. Hopefully, you had enough room <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband has to work all night. He ordered pizza. I am kind of wishing I had some pizza right now. <endOfText>
<human> Mmm, pizza sounds good. What's keeping you from ordering pizza yourself? Why let him have all the fun? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am not sure. I am thinking about ordering some. We will see. <endOfText>
<human> Go for it! You'll only regret the pizzas you don't eat! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got cut off in traffic the other day I almost wrecked. It ticked me off. <endOfText>
<human> Dang, traffic must be intense in your area <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have to make a birthday cake later tonight. <endOfText>
<human> who's birthday is it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was really hungry today and ate my roomates' leftovers. <endOfText>
<human> Do you feel bad about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Our little chihuahua was diagnosed with an auto-immune disease when she was just a puppy. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no!  Were you able to take care of him with medicine or treatments? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have such a great family <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear, one of the best advantages you can have in life <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last night a shadowy figure was at my window. <endOfText>
<human> Whoa, did you find out what it was? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate being the only person at the bar, even if it is 10 a.m. <endOfText>
<human> It can be boring to drink at the bar by yourself. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> indeed, i usually bring a pet with me to help ease the loneliness <endOfText>
<human> That must be a cool bar to let pets in. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I decided to do some deep cleaning. I was going to get rid of some stuff and could not bring myself to throw it away <endOfText>
<human> I have a problem getting rid of things too. Sometimes you just have to throw it away, or donate it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> One of coworkers passed away. I dont want to go back to work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. I am so sorry to hear that. Were you close with this coworker? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, we were good friends. <endOfText>
<human> Than I completely understand that would be so hard <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends 3 year old is able to ride a skateboard with ease! I was amazed at his skill! <endOfText>
<human> Nice, it's like little kids can learn anything! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I saw a ghost following me the other night. I was walking home and it kept moving towards me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh! are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend punched me! <endOfText>
<human> Ouch what a jerk. Why did he do that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my favorite pair of shorts are ruined, thanks to an overtrusted fart <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Was you at least at home when that happened? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad got sick when I was 13 and he ended up passing away because of it. <endOfText>
<human> Im so sorry, i can not immagine that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my old play toy the other day. It made me feel like i missed the old days. <endOfText>
<human> I can agree with that, adulting sucks <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i hate when the person behind me in ine is so close <endOfText>
<human> What do you mean? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dog of 10 years recently passed away. <endOfText>
<human> I truly do feel bad that you have to endure that. My girlfriend and I were just talking about how horrible she's going to feel when she loses her Havanese pup at some point in the distant future, since she's so close to her. I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Spent a lot of my saturday organizing and cleaning my room. There's no better feeling that knowing you accomplished an errand you were supposed to do, and getting to enjoy clean space after your hard work. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful! You're right, it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was mad last week when my landlord was taking their time fixing my ac. It was so hot <endOfText>
<human> Was your landlord truly trying their best, or did they simply not care about your well-being at that time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My roommate always pees all over the toilet seat. <endOfText>
<human> ugh. People like that are gross. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I amde enough money lately that i feel comfortable and ready to take on anything! <endOfText>
<human> Wow I envy you. That sounds like a wonderful feeling! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just go back from walking the dog, he was a perfect angel on the leash <endOfText>
<human> I didn't think that was possible for a dog on a walk! What kind of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love having my kitty snuggling up to me.  I feel so loved! <endOfText>
<human> Funny you say that... my roommate just got a cat about a month ago. I was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it, as I'm not the most fond of them. But I didn't want to say no. It's actually been an affectionate cat so far. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Cats will make you love animals!   They can be so affectionate. <endOfText>
<human> I suppose so. I've never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality, and they're either nice or mean, and never warm up to you over time. So, I was a little wary of that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Been making a lot of money off of my hobby lately. I think this thing might take off and I can quit my day job... I had no idea that would happen, or that people would enjoy my work enough to do that. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of hobby do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A man slapped his wife today at the store, i didnt take too kindly too it <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like an ugly scene...did anybody step in <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I used to have no sense of purpose in my life, total deadbeat loser....now I've taken the reigns and am in full control. Pretty amazing how far I've come <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! i am happy for you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend is having troubles. I don't know what to do as far as helping him. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of trouble is he having right now? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends dad past away, it was hard on her and the rest of her family. I ended up putting together one of them food trains to help them out <endOfText>
<human> Good job. That can be really tough to go through that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to cancel on a friend tonight. I felt bad about it but I was so tired <endOfText>
<human> They'll understand, sometimes it's better not to overextend yourself <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> it is a great honor to live in the USA <endOfText>
<human> Yes, I love it here. It is the greatest country in the world. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Im so upset me sister gets to stay out as late as she wants but i have to be in at 8 PM its not fair <endOfText>
<human> Dear lord, how old are you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was staying at a hostel and forgot to lock my backpack. I woke up the next day with money missing. <endOfText>
<human> O no did you report it to the hospital <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dogs are like my children to me and I can't stand when they are outside to long! <endOfText>
<human> Oh yes! I know your feeling. I see my dog as a child as well. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I found out my brother was moving when I was younger, it really hurt me. I was going to miss him <endOfText>
<human> That's touching, how is it these days? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My girlfriend enjoys going out with her friends for lady night once a month. I dont mind since I know she wont do anything stupid. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah I see no harm in that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i had a interview last week! i think im getting the promotion at work <endOfText>
<human> That would be great. Good luck. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We put an offer down on a house that I really want. <endOfText>
<human> Congratulations! I'm so happy to hear that. You must be really excited! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This week, my manager told me bad comments about my work performance. It made me feel bad. <endOfText>
<human> that isnt good, were they true? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother was hurt the other day and i felt so bad. <endOfText>
<human> How did he get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a train in Sri Lanka. I asked the passengers if I was at the right stop. They told me no. Turns out I was at the right place. <endOfText>
<human> Oh dang. Do you think it was intentional? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole money from my daughter's piggy bank and now she's wondering where her money went <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, what did you buy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I bought a few beers. I feel terribly guilty about it now. <endOfText>
<human> Was it at least Budweiser? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I came home to my back door being kicked in <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that. Do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that. Do you think it was an intruder or just some prankster? <endOfText>
<human> Intruder they went through all of my stuff <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel bad when I do not make it to church. I know I should be there <endOfText>
<human> What stops you from going? Being busy with life, or just deep down you just do not want to go <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sometimes catch myself looking at my husband and kids and thinking to myself that my life is good. <endOfText>
<human> Life is good when its like that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My kids got a ton of Halloween candy last year. Didn't think they would notice if I ate just a few of them. <endOfText>
<human> I don't blame you, I would have eaten some. Did they notice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am going to be happy next weekend. I am going on a nice little trip <endOfText>
<human> Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally got my BA. I am so happy to be done with college? <endOfText>
<human> School can be al ot of work <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am plannin gon asking this girl out and i am so nervous. <endOfText>
<human> I'm sure she'll be flattered if you're honest about how you're feeling! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have hope that the world will get better. <endOfText>
<human> what do you mean i think it is pretty good right now <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my grandma was rushed to the hospital im not sure what is going on <endOfText>
<human> That is terrible, i hope everything is ok <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a coworker sitting next to me that he is making noise with his pen the whole day long. It is disturbing me from my work. <endOfText>
<human> That's got to be annoying! Have you tried telling him to stop? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on the bus the other day and saw the grossest thing. <endOfText>
<human> what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There is a bunch of crime near me right now, i hope the police can get it taken care of <endOfText>
<human> Same here. Are you living on a street where it is normal, as far as crime? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> There was this one time years ago that we threw a party and I got so drunk, I do not remember anything! You know it is bad when you have people telling you what all you did and you can not remember any of it <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, when I was younger I did some of that stuff as well. It's a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you don't remember doing. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I live in an area with a lot of cottage properties. It blows me away some of the toys people have <endOfText>
<human> Oooh like what kind of toys? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I care for my girlfriend a lot, we are very close <endOfText>
<human> Aww, how long have you been together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I stole from my friend and i feel pretty bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Why did you steal stuff? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got approved for a scholarship for college that I had been competing for for many months! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I haven't been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, I wanted to attend a higher ranking school but they didn't give me any scholarship so I decided not to accept their offer. <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say, I'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process, especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like you'll be successful after college, especially because of how hard-working you are. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hate parents that censor every TV show, movie, video game, or song on the radio. Of course it's one thing to let a 5-year-old watch "Silence of the Lambs"; but do you really expect to raise the next Einstein by blinding him to the real world? By the time he's 13 he or she's gonna have some serious repression issues and grow up to be a weirdo <endOfText>
<human> I agree, such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids, doing more harm than good in the long run. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother won a championship in karate. I am so happy for him! <endOfText>
<human> What kind of belt does he have? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my husbands leftovers while he was asleep <endOfText>
<human> Did you tell him he ate it in his sleep <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am nervous about monday. I have to go to the doctor again <endOfText>
<human> Why are you having to go again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son started getting into a little bit of trouble and got kicked out of summer school on the first day, so he decided to sign up for a youth chalenge program <endOfText>
<human> Oh no. Well I hope that makes him better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've recently been on a weight loss program.  I've done very well.  I've lost 30 lbs! <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you. Just keep going <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am really happy with my tattoo artist. He is not charging me a lot for great work <endOfText>
<human> That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much. <endOfText>
<human> They can be very expensive <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom said she'd go to the doctor the next time she started feeling weird heart palpitations again. I'm about a thousand miles away from her, so I can't force her to go. But I'm worried about her, as she's always avoided the doctor, and always been in poor health. Hope she does the right thing <endOfText>
<human> I hope so, too. Heart conditions can be scary! Do you have anyone closer to her that could check in? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've gotten some bad publicity in the past. <endOfText>
<human> What is deserved or undeserved?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What is deserved or undeserved? <endOfText>
<human> Undeserved, buy I'm the only one that thought so. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My car engine start smoking but my mechanic arrived and fixed my car within an hour! <endOfText>
<human> That's good timing at least. Glad it didn't take too long. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree I was thoroughly impressed by his expertise. I was glad to be back on the road so quickly. <endOfText>
<human> What ended up being the problem ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I've been long distance with my girlfriend for about 6 years, mainly because I've been in university for a while. But I graduate this spring, and I'm going to propose to her after the ceremony. She's been patient this entire time, and hopefully it will all pay off. <endOfText>
<human> She sounds like a great girl. I am sure it will you sound like a happy couple. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am pretty happy with my life right now, it is going pretty well overall <endOfText>
<human> That's great when life just feels right <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through my attic and found some of my old childhood toys <endOfText>
<human> You must be feeling nostalgic, maybe your kids will enjoy them <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad knew I was having some financial difficulties and decided to pay off my car loan! I am so appreciative to him! <endOfText>
<human> Wow, that was super nice of him. You are lucky to have such a great dad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I clogged the toilet at work yesterday. I had to take a huge dump and there was nothing to do about it. The toilet couldn't handle it. I couldn't fix it, either. So, I just quietly whisked away. I feel bad for the janitor that has to deal with it <endOfText>
<human> yeah but that is his ob <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at a rangers game and this guy attacked a kid over the shirt he was wearing <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this, since there's usually alcohol involved. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When my husband and I first got together he use to talk to his ex girlfriend all the time cause she was with one of his friends. I despised that woman <endOfText>
<human> Yikes, that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did, he said she did not mean anything to him and stopped going over to his friends house <endOfText>
<human> That's good, at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Last week I stole a donut from my boyfriend's desk, I was really hungry <endOfText>
<human> Did your boyfriend notice? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was my birthday and i just knew my dad was gonna get me a car for my 16th. <endOfText>
<human> Did he! You lucky dog! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom is the best. my mom gave me the benefit of the doubt when i got a DUI. <endOfText>
<human> Were you actually under the influence? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends went on vacation without me, and now I have no one to hang out with for 3 weeks. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, I'm sorry to hear it. Did they at least ask you first? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my guard down around my best friend and she told all my secrets away <endOfText>
<human> Dang, I guess she wasn't your friend after all <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am upset with how I acted at work the other day, I lashed out when I should not have <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, did you get into trouble with your boss? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I miss the smell of burnt hay in the fall, my hometown farmers used to do it every year. <endOfText>
<human> I get that, nothing can beat home! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have the best dentist. <endOfText>
<human> A good dentist is great to have! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ate my wife's leftovers while she was taking a nap <endOfText>
<human> what were the left overs? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got this chick's number yesterday and I wasn't expecting it.  I was about to fight this one guy who was talking crap to me but he ran away like a little bitch and she and her friend saw everything...I thought they were gonna start avoiding me...but they actually chatted me up asking me where I'm from and now she's still texting me haha <endOfText>
<human> Sounds like quite the adventure you had. You must feel proud of yourself.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sounds like quite the adventure you had. You must feel proud of yourself. <endOfText>
<human> Maybe a little haha I was pretty heated though...glad it turned out for the better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Phew! The recent storm narrowly missed my neighborhood! <endOfText>
<human> Nice you must feel pretty lucky <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes I do and grateful for that luck. Wouldnt want my new Porsche to get dented! <endOfText>
<human> Haha I wouldn't either if I had a Porsche....sounds like you need some kind of bomb shelter emergency parking <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found a home and bought it and i can't believe i was able too. <endOfText>
<human> Are you happy with it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was scared last year at this time. I had a couch that would not go away <endOfText>
<human> A couch! how was it hurting you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was in elementary school, I forgot the words to my solo in a school play. <endOfText>
<human> Oh, no! It happens to the best of us. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have a pretty awesome husband. <endOfText>
<human> That's good to hear! What makes him so awesome? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got really upset when I got home today and my cat pooped on the bed. <endOfText>
<human> Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife has out of town for a couple weeks and we just moved to this city. I feel so bored and have no one to hang out with. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling good about this application. <endOfText>
<human> Oh yeah?  You applying to a new job?   <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh yeah?  You applying to a new job? <endOfText>
<human> Nope applied to my dream school actually. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We got this new printer at work and it MAKES ME SO MAD!!!! <endOfText>
<human> What does it not do right? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I totaled my brand new car yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, that isn't good.  Hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I do thankfully. It was some kid who didn't have a license. I'm still sad because it was my first car ever. <endOfText>
<human> Is the kid ok?  He won't have his license for a few more years probably now. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My fiance and I celebrate our 6th year anniversary on Monday! <endOfText>
<human> So exciting! Do you have any special gift in mind for them?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> So exciting! Do you have any special gift in mind for them? <endOfText>
<human> No, we are broke.  We are going out to dinner and maybe a movie but last year for our 5th we both forgot it till the next day! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend of mine who works for me (really with me) was recently offered another job for a little more pay.  I was quite nervous on what he would decide.  In fact, he never even mentioned it to me.  I found out through an acquaintance that he had been offered the job. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you don't feel jealous of your friend. Did he accept the job? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It wasn't so much jealousy.  I just depend on him a lot.  What was funny was that I asked him about it, and he told me, "I never mentioned it because I never considered it.  We've got too good a thing going here."  I was amazed at his loyalty. <endOfText>
<human> Seems like you have a trustworthy friend for life! I hope you cherish this friendship. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A mosquito has been flying around my face all day and its really starting to get to me. <endOfText>
<human> Don't you just hate that?! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I feel horrible. I let go of all of my friends and don't know how to move forward. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cut off today and crashed my car into a pole to avoid colliding with someone. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! Are you ok? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband will be away on a trip for the weekend and it will be so quiet without him here. <endOfText>
<human> Aww i'm sorry. Maybe enjoy a glass of wine and watch some girly shows. My husband is in the military and gone a lot so I feel for you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> This girl just invited me out on a date. She seems sweet and I'm interested.. more interested in her than I am this other girl I've been seeing for a few weeks. But I feel bad just dropping this girl I've been seeing recently. Like, wouldn't that be rude? <endOfText>
<human> I think if it's done without care then yes, care for what she would feel that is. Maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you're feeling, but it's up to you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My grandpa gave me his pocket watch <endOfText>
<human> That was very nice of him.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend bought me dinner tonight. It made me really appreciate him <endOfText>
<human> That's nice. Was it a special occasion or anything ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an old truck that when I drive it brings back memories from the past. <endOfText>
<human> What kind of memories <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend lost his brother recently and it was so sad <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! loss can be hard :( <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The results came in and I won the national debate championship with my team! <endOfText>
<human> Hey, congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. It's a good look in the future. Especially the debate team--you develop so many good life skills with that! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I agree, it was a proud moment for us! I had to sacrifice a lot of time and energy to be able to get here. <endOfText>
<human> I bet... that's a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. I'm sure it's a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm finally able to afford decent health insurance for once in my life. Not only does it feel good to know I'm covered for some unexpected bad stuff, but I can actually go to the dentist and optometrist and keep up with my teeth/eye health for once. <endOfText>
<human> Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing, and the more you look after your body, the better it will treat you.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing, and the more you look after your body, the better it will treat you. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah. I mean I was a home-body and lives a pretty boring life, so I never truly felt in danger of not having health insurance in the past. But it was still a pretty stupid way to live. One accident could have ended it all in terms of financial health. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am mad at my brother because he broke my bike. He always want to use my stuff and he ends up breaking it. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got an unfamiliar present in the mail addressed to me but I had no idea who sent it! <endOfText>
<human> That is strange. Did you like the gift? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I did. It was a PS4 console. Not a bad surprise to wake up to on a Sunday morning! <endOfText>
<human> That is for sure! Someone must really like you! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My best friend's grandmother passed away. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, sorry to hear that. How is he holding up? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got my marks back. <endOfText>
<human> What are those? Your grades? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I met a South Korean living in Argentina. He spoke perfect Spanish. Turns out hes fleeing the draft. <endOfText>
<human> Did you find out why he was fleeing the draft? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am very happy. My son was top of the class, this year. <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I bet you are so proud <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some of my old baseball stuff, great memories <endOfText>
<human> Were you playing in a team? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Raising kids is hard at time, sometimes I am positive I am doing everything right to the best of my ability then other days I am sit wondering if I am being level headed about it all <endOfText>
<human> I'm glad you're taking it seriously, parents have the ability to be the best thing that ever happened to their kids' lives, or the worst, but I'm sure you're doing your best <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh for sure, parenting is no joke. <endOfText>
<human> Hope you're enjoying it! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'll be getting a raise in February and I'm really looking forward to it. <endOfText>
<human> That's great! What percentage are you thinking you'll be getting? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A person assured me that nothing would happen. She calmed my nerves down about to be pushed into my arm <endOfText>
<human> How'd it end up after the fact ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was at walmart and saw all the old board games from my childhood <endOfText>
<human> That's always fun, to see those random memories crop up when you least expect. What kind of board games were they? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was on a flight earlier in the week, listening to music. I thought my earbuds were plugged into my iPod correctly so that only I could hear the music.. turns out it wasn't, and everyone could hear it on speaker the entire time. I just assumed it was hard to hear because of the loud plane.. nope. People listened to my death metal with me for two hours and said nothing. <endOfText>
<human> That is funny i feel like someone should have said something though <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my cat keeps bting me! <endOfText>
<human> How long have you had it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I  left most of my belongings at a hostel for 2 months. Everything was still there when I got back." <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's lucky. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We went to Six Flags yesterday and I felt so uneasy as I looked at the looming rollercoaster. <endOfText>
<human> Which Six Flags did you go to? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found some of my old baseball gear, it brought back great memories <endOfText>
<human> Nice, such relics of the past really hit you with a wave of nostalgia. Did the gear still fit you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I let my cousin look after my dog whilst I went on vacation this summer. <endOfText>
<human> Oh nice, how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It went well, my dog came back happy and healthy. My cousin did well to pay off my trust. <endOfText>
<human> Thats great! Glad it worked out for you and your dog was safe! I hear so many bad stories about people loosing pets. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I ruined my friends wedding because of my drunken behavior <endOfText>
<human> Haha I bet it wasn't that bad....was it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> sadly we got word our grandmothers canceris back <endOfText>
<human> That is unfortunate, is it possible to go through chemotherapy again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> im not sure she is really old <endOfText>
<human> I hope everything works out for you  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 12 year old lab just passed away. He was my buddy and I am really upset about losing him. <endOfText>
<human> That is so sad. Dogs become part of the family so when something like that happens it is like losing a family member <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter had a school project that I helped her assemble, after we was done with it she informed she wanted it on wheels. Sometimes kids can be such a pain. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I have a doughter as well and understand.  I guess kids will be kids! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend called me out for being noisy and rude at the dinner last night. It was a rude awakening for me. <endOfText>
<human> Uh oh, do you think you were being rowdy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Looks like it. And I was making everyone else feel uncomfortable too. i feel so ashamed that I made my own friends feel uneasy. <endOfText>
<human> It's Ok. Everyone can chang ein life. Do you drink too much? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my roommate will not clean anything. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my, sounds like you have the dreaded roommate situation on your hands. Have you tried talking to him?  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh my, sounds like you have the dreaded roommate situation on your hands. Have you tried talking to him? <endOfText>
<human> yes, but his actions do not listen to me. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was cut off this morning on the way to work. It caused me to crash into the ditch. I am so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Is the car terribly damaged? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to get it towed to the shop. We will see how bad it is. <endOfText>
<human> I hope it will be ok. Were you late for your work? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My license got lost in the mail and I had to go back to the dmv to get a new one. <endOfText>
<human> That sucks, it takes so long for them to arrive! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I wish that Summer wasn't almost over. <endOfText>
<human> I feel that, even though I prefer Winter <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I cannot wait for the new super smash bros, it is gonna be amazing <endOfText>
<human> Is that a game ? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic <endOfText>
<human> you can train and get better <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i went to see the boo of mormon ans i did not think it was that ood <endOfText>
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My dad just graduated college! <endOfText>
<human> Nice! You must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Nice! You must be so proud of him to achieve such a milestone! <endOfText>
<human> I am! He is such an amazing man. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The summer hurricane violently ripped through my neighborhood and destroyed everything in its path. <endOfText>
<human> Oh god! Is everyone you care about OK? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Yes, I am thankful for that. But devastated that my house and property have been swept away overnight. <endOfText>
<human> Man, i am so sorry, i could not imagine. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I can't get myself to throw away my late dogs toys, despite them being so old and torn up. <endOfText>
<human> Do you find value in them still? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I suppose, sentimental value more than monetary value. <endOfText>
<human> I think you should keep them instead of throwing them away. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ew what a gross wound my brother had. <endOfText>
<human> How did he get it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We had someone break into our hom. <endOfText>
<human> Oh my god! Are you ok? was anyone home? Did they take anything important? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> We are okay and thankfully we were not home. They went through everything, but didn't take anything. <endOfText>
<human> That's weird. I am happy you have your possesions. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found out my storage unit burned down and I had lost several irreplaceable items <endOfText>
<human> Was the fire set by someone or an accident? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i'm grateful for my life <endOfText>
<human> That is good.  It is nice to focus on the positives <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 15 year old stole a family members bank card number and overdrawn the account by $500. I was so mad I asked him about it and he had the nerve to lie to me even with the proof that I needed <endOfText>
<human> Ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times! I hope you made him realize what he did was wrong.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh teenagers can be so troublesome some times! I hope you made him realize what he did was wrong. <endOfText>
<human> Oh I did. I was always told that newborn years was the worse but raising know it all teens is the worse, makes me miss the newborn stage <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I sheltered an injured owl and nursed him back to health before setting him free. <endOfText>
<human> Helping animals sometimes brings great pleasure. You did a good deed <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you. I gave me great satisfaction to care for him though I felt a bit sad when I had to let him go home. <endOfText>
<human> Awe. Ya it doesn't take much to get attached to something that you are nursing back to health <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boyfriend took me to a cat cafe today because he knows I like cats <endOfText>
<human> That sounds like a cool place to go! Can you bring your cat there? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son just took his first steps. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! You must be so proud! How old is he? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found myself shocked today by my roommate. <endOfText>
<human> What did they do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through some old photos the other day and also came across a bunch of stuff that my kids have made me through the years, It brought back so many great memories <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful! I bet it was a nice trip down memory lane. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> A friend that I had during college came to visit me last week. I was not expecting him to contact me. It has been at least ten years that we didn't see each other. <endOfText>
<human> Wow that's been a long time. Did you two have a good time together? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Walked in my kitchen this morning and there was a huge spider in the sink. <endOfText>
<human> What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was eating with some friends, and over trusted a fart smh <endOfText>
<human> What did your friends do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I failed my drivers license exam because I didnt pay attention to oncoming traffic. I was so mad. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, when can you take it again? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Someone is coming to visit me i never expectied too! <endOfText>
<human> Hey that's great!  How long has it been? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so nervous right now.   I......I don't know what to do <endOfText>
<human> Whats going to happen? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm hoping to get a big bonus at work <endOfText>
<human> Oh I hope you get it! It can really help out or just be a splurge  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh I hope you get it! It can really help out or just be a splurge <endOfText>
<human> Yeah it is nice to be able to go out and just spend a little money! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> The place I ate at for lunch today only had a "B" rating for cleanliness, etc. on their health inspection. I never ate at a place that had less than an "A." But I ate there anyway since there wasn't anything else close by, and it smelled good and was cheap, and I'm poor.. I just know my stomach is going to be churning later <endOfText>
<human> a 'B'? Hmm, well you know how it is, hope your stomach feels better! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My favorite time of the year is during the holidays. My family gets together and talks about our lives. It is such a merry time. <endOfText>
<human> That's wonderful. I also love the holidays. It's the perfect time for families. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My brother finally got into law school! <endOfText>
<human> That's awesome. You must be so proud of him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Feeling so good about my drivers license test. <endOfText>
<human> Awesome! I hope you do well! When do you take it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm not sure if my boyfriend wants to get married yet. I won't rush him though. <endOfText>
<human> Communication is key, have you talked to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I went to an old part of town and these guys really scared me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no, next time you should bring a friend to be safe. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My coworker in the cubicle next to me is always talking! He really bothers me. <endOfText>
<human> What does he normally talk about? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had a date last night <endOfText>
<human> Nice!  Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My wife and I have been together for 5 years <endOfText>
<human> Gratz. What's the secret? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just staying faithful.  That girl is so loyal I love her so much. <endOfText>
<human> Good to hear, glad you guys are happy! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I brought my friend out and he made a complete idiot of himself. <endOfText>
<human> Was he drinking heavy? I'm sorry hope the night wasn't too bad. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I often get so annoyed having pictures taken of me, and getting asked to smile. I hate my teeth, since they're so big. I wish I had smaller, more natural teeth that other people do.. it makes me so paranoid sometimes. <endOfText>
<human> Don't be! You are awesome the way you are! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband put together a graduation party for me and I had no idea! <endOfText>
<human> Hey... congratulations to you on both fronts! That sounds like double good news. It was probably fun having your hard work rewarded with seeing the faces of all your loved ones and having them personally congratulate you. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It was, I was so thankful to him and I was also thankful to be done with school! <endOfText>
<human> Well, it's good to have you join the workforce in society. You seem like a positive person who can contribute well. Hopefully you find a passion that utilizes your hard-earned degree. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son went into a youth challenge program. I am hoping that this will help him become better person and give him the discipline that he needs. <endOfText>
<human> Ahh, is he a troublemaker right now? Most of the time, it's the friends they hang out with. Young people are easily influenced by the people around them. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I tripped over the sidewalk the other day, thankfully no one was around <endOfText>
<human> Did you get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend got a new wrangler, i want one so bad <endOfText>
<human> Nice, what year? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I had to rely on my own primal instincts and the Universe's subtle signs to guide me when I was homeless <endOfText>
<human> im sorry to hearyou were homeles <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we went to the beach and someone left  a bunch of dead fish out therer <endOfText>
<human> Interesting...you sure it wasn't fish that washed up on the shore <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I felt so embarrassed yesterday. <endOfText>
<human> Why, what happened to make you feel that <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> When I was at gym, my pants has torn from behind. I felt bad about it. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow that sucks! Hope it wasn't too embarassing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just got a new job <endOfText>
<human> That's great! Where are they working? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I got lost in an unfamiliar city last night. <endOfText>
<human> That is scary! Hope you did not find yourself in the bad part of town <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My teenager almost got kicked out of school when he was 16 because he kept getting caught with tobacco after the 5th time they said enough was enough and was really close of kicking him out for the rest of the year <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow! That is intense! I am glad he didn't get kicked out! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My father in law makes sure I am taken care of and he is the sweetest guy in the world.  It makes me feel special. <endOfText>
<human> That is amazing. Sounds like you have a really good support system. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I found my grandfathers old watch he used to wear all the time. It really reminds me of him a lot. <endOfText>
<human> That is pretty neat especially if it gives you good memories! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm excited for fall to start, I love layering my clothes <endOfText>
<human> I do too. I wish we could have fall weather longer. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My birthday was last week and I thought  everyone forgot about me. <endOfText>
<human> Oh what happened instead? Did your friends throw you a party? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I finally have a job and paid off the last dollar on my student loans today! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome! I cannot wait until my student loans are paid off! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> It is! Its best feeling and is a weight off my shoulders! I am finally content with my finances. <endOfText>
<human> I am happy for you!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am applying to graduate school and I am a little anxious about it! <endOfText>
<human> Oh, don't be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh, don't be! Just have faith in yourself and be confident that you can make it in. <endOfText>
<human> The interview is what is making me nervous! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I really want a Chanel bag for Christmas, my friend got one and it's so beautiful. <endOfText>
<human> They do have nice bags! I hope you are able to get one! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My son is turning 2 in a few months. <endOfText>
<human> Nice! How are you celebrating for him? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I'm going to eat sushi for the first time this coming weekend. <endOfText>
<human> Yum! Sushi is so good, I'm sure you'll enjoy it! I like the eel roll and spicy tuna roll. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Tomorrow might just be scary.  Not sure if I should go or not. <endOfText>
<human> Where are you going? I would say if your gut is telling you that it is not good then I would suggest listening to it <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My husband an I thought we would treat ourself toa nice dinner. I went to take a bite and looked down, thank goodness I did, there was a really nice piece of hair wrapped around my food <endOfText>
<human> A "really nice" piece of hair?  Yikes.  Did you send it back? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Football season is about to start. I used to always watch the opening day games with my dad. I'm halfway across the country now though, and we won't be able to do it in person for a long time. Makes me miss him <endOfText>
<human> Oh dang, that is too bad.  Can you guys video call? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I don't know if its weird but I am most comfortable laying in bed watching TV and hanging out from there. <endOfText>
<human> I'm right there with you. I've always been a home-body. I don't like going out as much. Sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much.. that could be true. But at least we're comfortable doin it. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My 5 year old son is already reading! He picked up on it so fast! <endOfText>
<human> That is awesome, I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter was also but I didn't want to put any pressure on him since all kids are so different and it didn't matter.  But he astounded me and loves reading and writing. <endOfText>
<human> I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get the big promotion at work. <endOfText>
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Are you able to be up for another one soon? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> SO I dropped my wallet in the train, and when I bent down to pick it up, I accidentally released a  loud fart. Worse of it call, there was lady who was sitting and heard it! <endOfText>
<human> It happens to the best of us! I know the lady understands! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I hope so, she pretended not to hear but I know she heard it. It was just so embarrassing and left me red faced! <endOfText>
<human> Maybe you'll never see her again!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I didn't get a big promotion at work, I worked so hard for it. <endOfText>
<human> Sorry to hear that, I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sorry to hear that, I know that you probably feel disappointed but there will be other opportunities! <endOfText>
<human> I was,but I will try harder next time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have been alone for almost 5 years now. <endOfText>
<human> As in living alone or single? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Was walking down the street yesterday and some little twerp ran his skateboard right into me, and he slammed into the back of my knee. It's been throbbing all day and it's swollen. Pretty sure something's messed up. I'm ready for bad news. At least I have insurance now. <endOfText>
<human> Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend! <endOfText>
<human> Yeah, I've been lazing all day. I'm already starting to feel really fat. I want to find that lil chump and ring his neck.. hopefully my insurance covers all I need it to <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My current employer is having big financials problem. I am afraid that the company will go into bankruptcy. <endOfText>
<human> That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like you're self-aware and anticipating the problem, though. Perhaps you've already started preparing to look elsewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> First time in a long time I've gotten a haircut that I'm satisfied with. For once my big head doesn't look so big. I actually don't feel too stupid looking! <endOfText>
<human> Nice. Did you find a good hairdresser? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my dog is sick we took him into the vet and now we are playing the waiting game <endOfText>
<human> I am sorry to hear that! My dog is a part of the family, so I understand. I hope everything is okay. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I loved my previous job. <endOfText>
<human> what did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get to go on vacation with my husband and kids on Monday. I am so excited! <endOfText>
<human> That's great. Where are you going? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My daughter is pregnant with her first child. I am optimistic everything will go smoothly. <endOfText>
<human> That is exciting. When is she due? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Sometimes I feel like I have so much going on that I feel overwhelmed and over ran with anxiety that it makes it hard to stay focused on everything <endOfText>
<human> I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop, take a deep breath, and do one thing at a time. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friends just recently purchased a brand new, new car smelling, 2019 Honda Civic. <endOfText>
<human> Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Well, for me, I am honestly angry.  I look at their success and feel it should be me! <endOfText>
<human> Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way, cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just had to tell mom I stole some candies, <endOfText>
<human> Woah, hope she doesn't report you! Jk <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have hope that I will get into grad school. <endOfText>
<human> What are you applying for? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Just got such a big award at the game. <endOfText>
<human> What game and what kind of award> <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am so happy with my life right now. <endOfText>
<human> You sound very content. What makes you happy? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> my boyfriend took me to a haunted house <endOfText>
<human> Nice, how was it? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I make the good fluffy cheesecake. But sometimes it's hard because the egg whites have to be perfectly beaten. <endOfText>
<human> Are you doing the cheesecake for your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I love so much my wife. She has been so caring and kind with me. <endOfText>
<human> That's really nice! You should show her you appreciate her. Maybe cook her dinner! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I get so flustered whenever there is a training class at work and I have to get up in front of everyone and walk out.  I dread if I have to use the restroom or get water! <endOfText>
<human> Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable!  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable! <endOfText>
<human> It really is, I just have social anxiety really bad I think. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My friend just won a lottery and got tickets to the Superbowl and I lost! <endOfText>
<human> Oh gosh, is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I dont think he can since he only won one ticket. I am beyond jealous right now but also happy for him since he really wants to go. <endOfText>
<human> Just one ticket, that sounds lonely for him. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> we went to disney with the kids it was amazing <endOfText>
<human> Nice! I want to take my daughter when she is older. Did you go to Disneyland or world? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My mom gave me one of our old photo albums the other day. <endOfText>
<human> aww that is great! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> i was in the break room and took a extra doughnut <endOfText>
<human> Oh naughty. Did anyone see you? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am all packed and ready to go see my family! <endOfText>
<human> Are you making a trip to see your family? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I recently found that I was adopted. I felt terrible bad. <endOfText>
<human> That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I lost my swim bottoms going down the slide at the water park. <endOfText>
<human> Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen, too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once, too! Now that was really scary <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My apartment complex is nickel and diming me and counting off so many things wrong with the apartment to detract from my security deposit as I get set to leave after this month. I know people said to expect to never see your security deposit again, but this is ridiculous! I feel like the apartment is pretty much exactly the same <endOfText>
<human> I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> My boss informed me that I am in the first position of getting the promotion <endOfText>
<human> That's pretty awesome, congrats <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> People can give me all the bullshit advice they want on how to live my life and how I need to know my place in society....but I'll just smile and nod because I only trust my instincts and am have ridiculously more freedom, money and happiness than I've ever had before <endOfText>
<human> Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people's business to tell you how to live.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people's business to tell you how to live. <endOfText>
<human> Exactly.  Funny thing is they're usually the same people that bitch and moan on Facebook about having a job or boss they hate but do nothing to change their path it's hilarious <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I have an overseas trip coming up. I have never been and I am feeling a little scared right now about going. <endOfText>
<human> that is exciting@ <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was watching professional rodeo last night. I was amazed at how the cowboyos can stay on the bulls so long. <endOfText>
<human> That is an amazing talent to have. I would be so scared! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I am waiting to see if I pass the GRE. <endOfText>
<human> I hope you did it. Don't worry too much. <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> Thank you, I am trying my best. <endOfText>
<human> If you need to you can always take it again. Good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I was going through the stuff in my attic last night <endOfText>
<human> Did you find anything great? <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> What a wonderful memory. <endOfText>
<human> Yeah reminds me of the good old days.  I miss my grandma.  She passed away about 15 years ago.  <endOfText>
<bot> <bot> I woke up this morning to my wife telling me she's pregnant! <endOfText>
<human> Oh hey that's awesome!  That is awesome right? <endOfText>
