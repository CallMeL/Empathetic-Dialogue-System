<bot> She has been sick for a month and is not improving.
<human> I'm sorry you are having to make that choice, but I feel it's our duty to them to help them pass on when they are not going to get better and help them not suffer any longer. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no!  I'm so sorry, we just went through that with our pup.  It's a hard choice to have to make.

<human> That's so sad. What do you think about that? <endOfText>
<bot> I don't want him to go but he is really ill

<bot> Yup, that is me right now. I am really not sure if I am going to pass or not.

<bot> I cannot stand that!  Did this happen to you recently?
<human> Yeah, I'm so hungry usually and I'll get hangry when this happens <endOfText>

<bot> Sounds like me on a good day, lol. I guess I will never reach that level of play.

<bot> The phone company almost charged my wife 500 dollars for a broken phone she had to return.
<human> Wow! Ask for a refund or some extra stuff! <endOfText>
<bot> They fortunately worked it out and there was no charge, but the worst part was that she tasked me with returning it on time and I totally didn't. I really screwed up.
<human> Dang, well at least you got your money <endOfText>
<bot> Wow! Ask for a refund or some extra stuff!

<human> Did you ask a friend for help? <endOfText>
<bot> I did, actually. I didn't know him very well, but he was in my class and very generously offered to help.  I wasn't sure he would come through, but fortunately he did!
<human> That's great. So everything went well? <endOfText>

<bot> You ever browse through old photos on a friend's Facebook page? Kinda weird right?
<human> I have. Sometimes it's nice to see what old friends have been up to, and what new friends have done. I don't think it's too strange. <endOfText>
<bot> It is when it's an attractive friend...and it's obvious you're creeping on them. Man that's embarrassing.
<human> That definitely changes things. I could understand how that might be considered weird, I agree. <endOfText>

<bot> After failing inspection, my friend offered to repair the required parts of my car with his own tools, I was confident he could do so for significantly cheaper than the garage.
<human> He charged you? <endOfText>
<bot> Only for the required parts. He did the labor for free! I tipped him though, of course.
<human> Did it all work out? Or did he completely mess up your car hah <endOfText>
<bot> He took the car to his own mechanic and it passed the inspection no problem. Probably saved about $500.

<bot> I was happy to be in the position to be able to lend her the money. I'm really hoping she pays me back, though! Money's always a bit tight for me too!

<bot> Exactly the other day I had to do a demo in front of the class and I was partnered with someone who doesn't like me.

<bot> My first dog died a year ago. He was only 4 years old.
<human> I am sorry for your loss. How did he die if you don't mind me asking? <endOfText>
<bot> He had to have surgery because he ate something he shouldn't and it got caught. They told us he only had a 5% chance of survival and even then he would be in a lot of pain for a long time. We put him down to keep him out of pain.
<human> That's terrible... At least you tried to save him. <endOfText>

<bot> So, I was in Barcelona a month or so ago and had an early flight to Rome. I was catching a bus at 4am and this car comes out of nowhere and offered me and the other 3 people there a ride to the airport for 12 euro. It didn't even look like a cab. Sketchy.
<human> Yikes! That would be really scary!! I hope you didn't get in the car! <endOfText>
<bot> We did. This British chick convinced me it was worth the risk. The Chinese tourist couple just went along with it. I refused to put my backpack in the trunk and rode up front with it in case I needed to tuck and roll hah. Had my phone out with the GPS to make sure he was actually going to the airport. It all ended up being fine...aside from the speeding.

<human> Wow! I hope it didn't cause a lot of damage, I have a bunch of very tall trees in my yard as well. <endOfText>

<human> You can always use and old mason jar wrapped in some hemp fiber <endOfText>
<bot> Oh! That's smart. I'm not crafty, clearly lol
<human> Oh you can be! Everyone can! It just takes the will to cut the fabric!  <endOfText>
<bot> You can always use and old mason jar wrapped in some hemp fiber
<human> Oh! That's smart. I'm not crafty, clearly lol <endOfText>
<bot> I finally have some stability in my life for the first time in a long time. It feels very good to be able not to worry about much... For now.
<human> It's always a good thing to be able to focus on things that don't have to do with money.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes indeed. I just found a new place to live, got a car for a good deal, and have been doing well at my new job. I am sorry for bragging, I just feel really good about things.
<human> No need to be sorry! You are at a place that we all should be able to be but for many reasons can not. Good job! <endOfText>

<human> Thank you for the well wishing I do appreciate it. <endOfText>
<bot> My boyfriend want to buy a house but I think the housing bubble is going to burst again.
<human> you know sometimes it is hard to predict something like that <endOfText>
<bot> yeah, I just don't want to be one of the unlucky one's
<human> but if you don't buy now, as the prices go higher, you will regret it <endOfText>
<bot> you know sometimes it is hard to predict something like that
<human> yeah, I just don't want to be one of the unlucky one's  <endOfText>
<bot> but if you don't buy now, as the prices go higher, you will regret it
<human> You are right. Thanks! <endOfText>
<bot> I have a friend who helped me a great deal when my husband and I separated and I could not deal with him.
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that but I'm glad you have a good friend!  <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks, she helped a lot in that situation.
<human> Hopefully everything has been uphill since then!  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh I'm sorry to hear that but I'm glad you have a good friend!
<human> Thanks, she helped a lot in that situation. <endOfText>
<bot> I am going to see a concert at the end of the month.
<human> Exciting, what concert? <endOfText>
<bot> They are a coverband of a band from the 80s.
<human> That would be so nice, I have not went to a concert in ages <endOfText>
<bot> Exciting, what concert?
<human> They are a coverband of a band from the 80s.  <endOfText>
<bot> My son really wanted a bow and arrow, but I could not afford to get him one
<human> That's too bad. We always want to give our kids the things they want. I'm sure he'll understnad <endOfText>
<bot> Well he is only four, so he does not know a lot about money yet, I feel so bad for him
<human> Well there will be plenty of time for him to still build that skill as he grows up <endOfText>

<bot> Well there will be plenty of time for him to still build that skill as he grows up
<human> That is very true, hopefully we can raise him to understand money is not everything <endOfText>
<bot> I recently started seeing a lady and I want to be committed to her to help build our relationship.
<human> Oh that sounds nice, have you had trouble in the past staying committed? <endOfText>
<bot> I have made fumbles in the past, but I'm working on self improvement. Also I'm trying to keep an open mind.
<human> Well, life isn't a football game, so "fumbles" are something that everyone does. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh that sounds nice, have you had trouble in the past staying committed?
<human> I have made fumbles in the past, but I'm working on self improvement. Also I'm trying to keep an open mind. <endOfText>
<bot> I've been feeling a bit nervous about my next decisions in life. How do I know what the right thing to do is?
<human> I know exactly what you mean. It's really tough but when I make decisions I try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary. <endOfText>
<bot> I think the right thing to do is, if people around you know what you should be doing or where you should be going, they should tell you plainly. To not do that is providing them plausible deniability if you screw up.
<human> That sounds right to me. I actually have a few people around me that give me straight forward advice like that. <endOfText>
<bot> I know exactly what you mean. It's really tough but when I make decisions I try to stand on them and be willing to pivot if necessary.
<human> I think the right thing to do is, if people around you know what you should be doing or where you should be going, they should tell you plainly. To not do that is providing them plausible deniability if you screw up. <endOfText>
<bot> Sometimes I feel that I have more people around me that want to drive me like a horse rather than love me as a son. But, I guess that's not true. It's just my feelings.
<human> Sometimes it can be true. Don't be taken for a run  <endOfText>
<bot> In many circumstances, I feel as though I'm confused by situations in my life. I hope that everything turns out for the best.
<human> I hope that everything turns out the best for you too!  <endOfText>
<bot> Sometimes it can be true. Don't be taken for a run
<human> In many circumstances, I feel as though I'm confused by situations in my life. I hope that everything turns out for the best. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh man I can't wait to give my mother in law her house back. I just got a new place but have to wait a week to move in.
<human> Congratulations, that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace. <endOfText>
<bot> A little slower than I want but at least it's going to happen. I'm getting very antsy though haha.
<human> That's understandable, I'm sure it will be exciting to customize and furnish your space. <endOfText>
<bot> Congratulations, that sounds like things are moving along at a nice pace.

<human> Yes! Thanks for listening! It's making me more excited! haha <endOfText>
<bot> I miss my old dog, I was thinking about getting another one but I'm not sure.
<human> How long has it been since you had your old dog? <endOfText>
<bot> It's been 2 years, so I'm out of the habit of walking, cleaning, etc.
<human> It might take a bit of time to get back into the swing of owning a dog. I'm sure you'll be ready soon if you still think it over. <endOfText>
<bot> How long has it been since you had your old dog?
<human> It's been 2 years, so I'm out of the habit of walking, cleaning, etc. <endOfText>
<bot> I recently quit a really bad job, but I didn't have another job lined up
<human> I lost my job, so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income.  <endOfText>
<bot> It definitely is. It took a huge leap of faith
<human> Sometimes you got to just do it and hope and pray all comes out like it should, and it usually does.  <endOfText>
<bot> I lost my job, so I know how you feel. It is tough not have a source of income.
<human> It definitely is. It took a huge leap of faith <endOfText>
<bot> In the past, I was given a loving home with parents that helped me and a career path I could have succeeded on, and I blew it.
<human> It's never to late to continue on that path or find a new one. Same happened here. <endOfText>
<bot> Maybe you're right. I just need help in so many different areas of my life...
<human> I always try to remind myself. Tomorrow is a new day. What do you want to do with yours? <endOfText>
<bot> It's never to late to continue on that path or find a new one. Same happened here.
<human> Maybe you're right. I just need help in so many different areas of my life... <endOfText>
<bot> My storage unit got robbed while I was moving to a new home. They took all my family antiques and precious items.
<human> That's terrible. I don't know what's up with this world anymore, it seems like things are always getting worse. <endOfText>
<bot> I know, thought about selling those things. wish I had done that. at least got money for them.
<human> Well if they were family heirloom or photographs, I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping. <endOfText>
<bot> That's terrible. I don't know what's up with this world anymore, it seems like things are always getting worse.
<human> I know, thought about selling those things. wish I had done that. at least got money for them. <endOfText>
<bot> Well if they were family heirloom or photographs, I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping.
<human> That's true. still have a few things for memories. <endOfText>
<bot> I know it's very petty of me but it is starting to bug me. My family has been very generous towards my adult sister as of late but have not really paid much attention to me.
<human> Have you tried talking to them about this?  <endOfText>
<bot> This has happened on and off for years, and I always try to talk to them. I usually get no response. It's led me to be self-sufficient fortunately.
<human> That's really frustrating, they'll realize only when you start distancing yourself from them <endOfText>

<bot> That's really frustrating, they'll realize only when you start distancing yourself from them
<human> I have in the past and it didn't seem to work. I'm hopeful they will open up to me one day though. <endOfText>
<bot> I remember a time where I was asked to help out with a kids camp as a volunteer and it was about 2 months ahead of time, so I completely forgot about it and ended up not going
<human> Did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence? I hope there were no hard feelings! <endOfText>
<bot> no idea, I was too embarrassed to respond
<human> Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. Either way, I'm sure there were no hard feelings. A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year. <endOfText>
<bot> Did you hear anything about what happened at that camp in your absence? I hope there were no hard feelings!
<human> no idea, I was too embarrassed to respond <endOfText>
<bot> Sorry for the delay. I had a technical difficulty. Either way, I'm sure there were no hard feelings. A lot of people sign up to work those camps every year.
<human> no worries, I was having a bug either for some reason <endOfText>
<bot> My wife's out of town right now on business. She has to go on these trips a few times a year. I miss her a lot.
<human> That's completely understandable. Have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I do. I usually go out and catch up with friends a lot. Plus I know she's working hard to help provide for us, so I greatly appreciate it.
<human> That's the best thing you can do really. I hope she comes back soon for your sake! <endOfText>
<bot> That's completely understandable. Have you tried distracting yourself with hobbies or productive chores?
<human> Yeah I do. I usually go out and catch up with friends a lot. Plus I know she's working hard to help provide for us, so I greatly appreciate it. <endOfText>
<bot> That's the best thing you can do really. I hope she comes back soon for your sake!
<human> She should! Thanks for hearing me out, it helps a lot! <endOfText>
<bot> I was able to find some Blue Bell ice cream on sale the other day.
<human> Any ice cream on sale sounds like a good time to me. I've never heard of Blue Bell though, is it any good? <endOfText>
<bot> Yea I love the brand it has almost a home churned style taste in my opinion.
<human> I'll need to find some and give it a taste myself! That sounds awesome. <endOfText>

<bot> Oh boy I am livid! I just got this new couch from my family and my cats have already shredded an entire side of it.
<human> Oh no, that's such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household? <endOfText>
<bot> No, that's what's very shocking about this! They're decent cats. I know they're animals who don't know better but I really liked this couch.
<human> Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, that's such an awful thing for them to do. Do your cats often ruin things in the household?
<human> No, that's what's very shocking about this! They're decent cats. I know they're animals who don't know better but I really liked this couch. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh odd. That's a good way to look at it though; too many people get too angry with their pets over these type of things.
<human> Agreed. We forget that they're small animals. Their brains aren't that big! <endOfText>
<bot> I let my boyfriend make all or most of our decisions.
<human> And is he okay with that? <endOfText>
<bot> He would much rather it be that way. he is more calculated and experienced in life than I am.
<human> I suppose that makes sense. As long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic, that's all that counts! <endOfText>
<bot> And is he okay with that?
<human> He would much rather it be that way. he is more calculated and experienced in life than I am. <endOfText>
<bot> I suppose that makes sense. As long as both of you are happy with your relationship dynamic, that's all that counts!
<human> Yep, I get to learn from him too. <endOfText>
<bot> I got really down this morning. I saw a treehouse on the side of the road and it made me remember mine.
<human> What happened to yours? <endOfText>
<bot> I outgrew it. It was a long long time ago back in my childhood.
<human> That is a real shame, at least you can hold on to your memories. <endOfText>
<bot> What happened to yours?
<human> I outgrew it. It was a long long time ago back in my childhood. <endOfText>
<bot> That is a real shame, at least you can hold on to your memories.
<human> Yeah that's all we have sometimes, I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> It's been a rough day! My water heater is busted. Fortunately I got a plumber coming in that can fix it over the weekend.
<human> Dang that's a definite mood killer. At least you've got a fix on the way. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, it's rare in my area to get work done over the weekend. I'm thinking it could be done by monday, fingers crossed!
<human> One can only hope! <endOfText>
<bot> Dang that's a definite mood killer. At least you've got a fix on the way.
<human> Yeah, it's rare in my area to get work done over the weekend. I'm thinking it could be done by monday, fingers crossed! <endOfText>
<bot> I don't know what will happen in the future if Global Warming is not stopped.
<human> Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn't good. <endOfText>
<bot> And the fires too, there have been a lot of those lately, seems that worse than ever.
<human> Yeah forest fires are getting really bad. <endOfText>
<bot> Well from what i have read we will all be drowning which isn't good.
<human> And the fires too, there have been a lot of those lately, seems that worse than ever. <endOfText>
<bot> I really screwed up today! I was working on a big pot of pit beef, followed the old family recipe, and it tastes like garbage!
<human> Odd! Any idea where you went wrong? <endOfText>
<bot> Could've been a seasoning issue, I'm not too sure. I was so determined to make a good batch of this stuff! Oh well, I can always try again.
<human> Practice definitely makes perfect! <endOfText>
<bot> Odd! Any idea where you went wrong?
<human> Could've been a seasoning issue, I'm not too sure. I was so determined to make a good batch of this stuff! Oh well, I can always try again. <endOfText>
<bot> Practice definitely makes perfect!
<human> For sure! I think I'll nail it next time! <endOfText>
<bot> Kids grow up so fast, It seem like yesterday when mine were babies.
<human> How old are they now? <endOfText>
<bot> The oldest is 14 and is beginning high school next week.
<human> Soon they will be leaving the nest, hey? <endOfText>
<bot> How old are they now?
<human> The oldest is 14 and is beginning high school next week. <endOfText>
<bot> Oooo I was not feeling that good earlier in the week. I made some egg salad and I guess I didn't cook it right because I got very ill.
<human> I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you better now? <endOfText>
<bot> I'm almost there. It's a lot better today than earlier in the week. I think "ill" would be an understatement.
<human> I hope it is nor Samonella, just a temporarily bug. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry to hear that.  Are you better now?
<human> I'm almost there. It's a lot better today than earlier in the week. I think "ill" would be an understatement. <endOfText>
<bot> I hope it is nor Samonella, just a temporarily bug.
<human> It might been a good old American case of generic food poisoning. <endOfText>
<bot> I remember when my grandma was sick and we the grandchildren took turns keeping her company and helping her with whatever she needed.
<human> You guys sound like great grand kids, I bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it. <endOfText>
<bot> I believe so and it was a very sweet experience for us.
<human> I bet you guys were close and this certainly brought you all closer together. I'm so happy that you had these connections with your family. <endOfText>
<bot> You guys sound like great grand kids, I bet she wholeheartedly appreciated it.
<human> I believe so and it was a very sweet experience for us. <endOfText>
<bot> Hi, I went on a road trip this summer.
<human> Sounds like fun!  Did you enjoyed it? How far did you go? <endOfText>
<bot> It was great! It was a long drive, but my husband didn't get lost.
<human> Great! love road trips!  I hope to take one soon. <endOfText>
<bot> Sounds like fun!  Did you enjoyed it? How far did you go?
<human> It was great! It was a long drive, but my husband didn't get lost. <endOfText>
<bot> It was a very busy week for me, but now that the weekend is here I'm looking forward to relaxing at home.
<human> Why has your week been so busy? <endOfText>
<bot> With work the kids and everything else, but I feel relieved that the weekday is over and plan to watch some good movies over the weekend and do nothing much.
<human> Do you know what movie you plan on watching? <endOfText>
<bot> Why has your week been so busy?
<human> With work the kids and everything else, but I feel relieved that the weekday is over and plan to watch some good movies over the weekend and do nothing much. <endOfText>
<bot> Yesterday I went to the supermarket with some old clothes I wear around the house not expecting to meet anyone I know, but I met my boss and his wife.
<human> yikes! That must have caught you off guard. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, but it was to be expected after all, it is what happen when you dress like you expect to meet no one, I guess.
<human> Murphy's law i suppose. I'm sure it wasn't so bad though in the end. <endOfText>
<bot> yikes! That must have caught you off guard.
<human> Yes, but it was to be expected after all, it is what happen when you dress like you expect to meet no one, I guess. <endOfText>
<bot> Last week I ate my husband's leftovers, even though I knew he was looking forward to it.
<human> Oh no! Did he take it okay? <endOfText>
<bot> I kind of pretended I forgot it was was his, and he believed me.  Or acted like it lol.
<human> That's sweet that you guys are able to let the small things go. It sounds like you have a great relationship. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! Did he take it okay?
<human> I kind of pretended I forgot it was was his, and he believed me.  Or acted like it lol. <endOfText>
<bot> I had a job interview yesterday and it went great, so I'm expecting for them to call soon.
<human> I'm in the same boat. I'm so happy to hear that and I hope you get the job! <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you!  I look forward to working for that company because it seems really nice and they pay good salaries.
<human> Companies that pay their workers well equals happy workers! <endOfText>
<bot> I'm in the same boat. I'm so happy to hear that and I hope you get the job!
<human> Thank you!  I look forward to working for that company because it seems really nice and they pay good salaries. <endOfText>
<bot> In two weeks I'll be back teaching with a brand new group of kids.
<human> Are you excited for the new group? <endOfText>
<bot> I am, but slightly nervous too.
<human> Well, I hope it goes well! <endOfText>
<bot> Are you excited for the new group?
<human> I am, but slightly nervous too. <endOfText>
<bot> I just dyed my hair for the first time by myself. I had to watch a lot of videos to make sure I knew how to do it.
<human> Must be hard when you can't physically see what you are doing. <endOfText>
<bot> It was, I did the back last. A youtuber gave a good tip to treat it like shampooing your hair. That really helped
<human> Yeah YouTube is a good source of information. <endOfText>

<human> Unfortunately I've never heard of it! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh the nostalgia of watching old movies. What movie?
<human> Mystery Men <endOfText>
<bot> I went skydiving a few weeks ago. It was certainly an exercise in trust.
<human> I used to want to do that so bad when I was younger. Was it amazing? <endOfText>
<bot> It was! And my tandem partner was great. I'm still alive, which is a testament. :)
<human> That's so awesome. I don't think I would have the courage now. Will you do it again? <endOfText>
<bot> I used to want to do that so bad when I was younger. Was it amazing?
<human> It was! And my tandem partner was great. I'm still alive, which is a testament. :) <endOfText>
<bot> I got a lot of hours at work for next month. I hope I can use it to move to a new apartment
<human> That's a great goal to set for yourself. Where do you work if I may ask? <endOfText>
<bot> I work for a company that releases standardized tests in the US
<human> Sounds important. I hope you're able to meet your goal! <endOfText>

<bot> The first time I went on a motorcycle, I was scared. But I knew my husband wouldn't do anything to hurt me. I trusted him with my life.
<human> It must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone, and motorcycles can be fun! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, It was so much fun. I didn't want it to end.
<human> Awesome. I've only rode dirt bikes personally, but i definitely see the appeal.  <endOfText>
<bot> It must be nice to have that kind of trust for someone, and motorcycles can be fun!
<human> Yes, It was so much fun. I didn't want it to end. <endOfText>

<human> Aw, I've been there, I bet you like it!  Especially after you get used to it. <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks! Change is always hard. But I am looking forward to new challenges.
<human> That is such a great attitude! <endOfText>

<human> Thanks! Change is always hard. But I am looking forward to new challenges.  <endOfText>
<bot> That is such a great attitude!
<human> What do you do for work? <endOfText>
<bot> When I was a kid, I watched Psycho at a sleepover on Halloween.
<human> That's terrifying! I bet you didn't sleep that night! <endOfText>
<bot> I actually avoided the shower for days!  lol
<human> HA! Are you a fan of horror movies now, or do you still find them scary? <endOfText>
<bot> I'll watch them now because my husband loves them, but they're not my favorite
<human> Yeah, me either, although there have been some good ones lately. Better stories, more plot.  <endOfText>

<bot> I had to borrow money from my parents to pay the mortgage. I am having trouble making ends meet.
<human> I am sorry to hear that,  I hope it is only a temporarily situation and you will be on your feet in no time. <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks I hope so too. I recently took on a second part time job so that should help. These are tough times for a lot of people.
<human> Yes I know.  It hasn't been easy for me either, but I believe think will go our way pretty soon. <endOfText>

<bot> A friend of mine recently met George Clooney at a restaurant and posted a picture with him on Instagram!
<human> Wow that's so exciting! I bet he's a nice guy in real life.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes she even spoke to him for while!  I wish it was me, I love the guy!
<human> Cool! That's so neat.  <endOfText>

<bot> We are really wanting wanting to buy a newer and bigger vehicle, but we're not sure if we can afford it.
<human> Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used, or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75% less than what I would've paid from a car dealer! <endOfText>
<bot> Problem is we don't have a car payment now and going back to having one would be a struggle. We are trying to figure out and pay off bills now.
<human> Well, stick through it! I wish you luck :)  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no. Maybe you can find one that is used, or even rebuilt. I got my car for 75% less than what I would've paid from a car dealer!

<bot> I ate a whole gallon of ice cream by myself in one sitting and now I'm not feeling too happy.
<human> Oh, I could do that if I didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I'm telling myself that its okay since it was just a one time thing. I'll walk it off tomorrow!
<human> Lol, burn those calories. Hope you have a high metabolism. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, I could do that if I didn't have bad teeth and can't handle the cold. I would regret it if I did though because I really need to lose some weight.
<human> Yeah, I'm telling myself that its okay since it was just a one time thing. I'll walk it off tomorrow!  <endOfText>
<bot> I can't believe I was so stupid to believe this...
<human> What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> My boyfriend.  I knew he cheated on me but he said he wouldn't do it again.
<human> Well, you gave him the benefit of the doubt. It was his decision to cheat.  <endOfText>
<bot> True. Makes me feel so dumb though!
<human> Now you have more information to base your next decision on. You live you learn. <endOfText>
<bot> What happened?
<human> My boyfriend.  I knew he cheated on me but he said he wouldn't do it again.  <endOfText>

<human> Agreed! <endOfText>
<bot> My uncle volunteered to fix my car. I was going to take it to the dealership.
<human> That's kind of him! Is he good at that sort of thing? <endOfText>
<bot> I thought so. Though I wondered, should I risk not going to the dealership.
<human> Yes you'd have more warranty kind of things with work from a dealership <endOfText>
<bot> I'm glad I let him fix it though. Car works great.
<human> That's awesome! I wish someone in my family was so handy! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah. I saved $300.
<human> Wow! Maybe you should take uncle out for dinner! LOL <endOfText>
<bot> That's kind of him! Is he good at that sort of thing?

<human> Yeah. I saved $300. <endOfText>
<bot> I love looking at old photos. Makes me miss the good old days.
<human> Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, even ones from 5 or 6 years ago! Especially ones of the kids.
<human> I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I, they get teary-eyed. <endOfText>
<bot> Me too. Old photos bring about such nostalgia.
<human> Yeah, even ones from 5 or 6 years ago! Especially ones of the kids.  <endOfText>
<bot> I can only imagine! When my parents open old photo albums of my siblings and I, they get teary-eyed.
<human> It's true! You can really see the passage of time. I try to take lots of photos but it's easy to forget when you're in the moment.  <endOfText>
<bot> I'm in a wedding party tomorrow, and I've been called upon to give a big toast during the reception.
<human> Wow, that's such an honor.  How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> I am deeply touched and I've got everything laid out, but it's in front of a large amount of people and I'm sweating bullets over it.
<human> I'd be very nervous too.  I get stage fright. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, that's such an honor.  How do you feel about it?
<human> I am deeply touched and I've got everything laid out, but it's in front of a large amount of people and I'm sweating bullets over it. <endOfText>
<bot> I'd be very nervous too.  I get stage fright.
<human> I keep pacing back and forth going over everything. I hope it works out! <endOfText>
<bot> I was thinking about a friend of mine who passed away a few years ago.  Then I found some letters that he had written me.
<human> I bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you. I'm sorry for your loss. <endOfText>
<bot> It did, but it made me smile while reading them.
<human> That's great. It's just as good to remember the great times you spent together as it is to grieve. <endOfText>
<bot> I bet that whipped up a lot of feelings inside of you. I'm sorry for your loss.
<human> It did, but it made me smile while reading them. <endOfText>
<bot> I can't believe I thought I'd get away with this...
<human> Get away with what? <endOfText>
<bot> I'm doing awful in math class. We had an assignment and I found some of the answers in the back of the book.
<human> Did you get caught using them?! <endOfText>
<bot> I did! It was awful. I got called out in front of everyone, too.
<human> Wow! That's terrible! Maybe next time just get a tutor instead of cheating! <endOfText>
<bot> You got that right.
<human> Sorry this happened! <endOfText>
<bot> Get away with what?

<bot> So, I went to a bachelorette weekend with my girl friends. All of them were doing things their husbands would NOT be happy with, but I stayed far away from anything like that.
<human> Oh dear! What happened!? <endOfText>
<bot> They were kissing and dancing on other men. My husband would have been so upset if I was doing it, too!
<human> Oh my goodness! Good for you for getting away from that trouble! <endOfText>
<bot> I know! Some have them have told me how guilty they felt. I am just happy I didn't take part in any of it.
<human> Next day guilt when the fun is done. How awful. I wonder if they'll fess up. <endOfText>
<bot> Doubt it!
<human> Yikes. I'm glad you're not mixed up in that! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh dear! What happened!?
<human> They were kissing and dancing on other men. My husband would have been so upset if I was doing it, too! <endOfText>

<human> Doubt it! <endOfText>
<bot> I was at work assigned to a project on a team.
<human> How did that go? Do you like that?  <endOfText>
<bot> Well. I ended up taking someone's work and passing it off as my own.
<human> Oh no! Really? Were they upset? <endOfText>
<bot> How did that go? Do you like that?
<human> Well. I ended up taking someone's work and passing it off as my own. <endOfText>
<bot> My spouse had a brief affair last year. It ended and we are still together.
<human> Who was it with? <endOfText>
<bot> A co-worker.
<human> Were you more mad at them or your spouse? <endOfText>
<bot> Who was it with?
<human> A co-worker.  <endOfText>
<bot> Were you more mad at them or your spouse?
<human> Both of them! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh I was so shaking in my boots. I was sitting outside on my patio and saw a shadowy figure inside my house!
<human> What was it?  Did everything turn out alright? <endOfText>
<bot> At first, I jumped and ran in because I certainly wasn't expecting visitors. But it was my wife! She was home from work early!
<human> Phew! I'm glad that's all it was. <endOfText>
<bot> What was it?  Did everything turn out alright?
<human> At first, I jumped and ran in because I certainly wasn't expecting visitors. But it was my wife! She was home from work early! <endOfText>
<bot> Phew! I'm glad that's all it was.
<human> Yeah we had a good laugh over it, but I swear to you I was very scared! <endOfText>
<bot> My son got in big trouble at school.  He was very mean to his best friend, and I had to call his mom and explain what had happened.
<human> That's terrible when friends fight. What was it over? <endOfText>
<bot> He wasn't even upset with his friend, he was upset with someone else.  I felt so bad having to explain it to his friends mom.
<human> That's got to be a tough phone call to make. Did you two make amends or is she very upset? <endOfText>
<bot> She was fine with it.  She knew he was in big trouble at home.
<human> Uh oh don't want to be that kid that's for sure! <endOfText>
<bot> That's terrible when friends fight. What was it over?
<human> He wasn't even upset with his friend, he was upset with someone else.  I felt so bad having to explain it to his friends mom. <endOfText>

<human> She was fine with it.  She knew he was in big trouble at home. <endOfText>
<bot> New neighbors moved in this week, and they have a dog that looks almost exactly like my childhood dog.
<human> How interesting.  How does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> When I first saw it I felt like I had time traveled for a second.  So weird.
<human> Yes, I think that would be a little surreal, and I might feel ambivalent about it. <endOfText>
<bot> How interesting.  How does that make you feel?
<human> When I first saw it I felt like I had time traveled for a second.  So weird. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh I wish I could clear my closet out but I just can't part with these things.
<human> I felt the same way as you, but what's the point of keeping things you don't use and having it take up space? Do you use everything in your closet?  <endOfText>
<bot> I don't use it but I've collected so many little things in memory boxes. It's really grown to a few boxes now.
<human> So the items are sentimental to you? I know how hard it is to part with items that have memories behind them, but at the end of the day, they are just items! :) <endOfText>

<human> They really are. Maybe I should put them into a scrapbook! <endOfText>
<bot> My father sent me a photo of a letter I wrote for his birthday when I was a kid.
<human> Oh how sweet! What did it say? <endOfText>
<bot> I wrote about how much I appreciated him picking me up from school everyday and helping me with my homework. So adorable to read it!
<human> I love finding treasures like that!  <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I'm glad he kept them because it's always amazing to find it later in life.
<human> I hope that I am able to share such nice things with my own kids one day. <endOfText>
<bot> Me too. I will keep every little drawing and letter they make me. It's worth it.
<human> I really enjoy that too! <endOfText>

<bot> I signed up to do a lot of food for a family reunion next weekend. I have to start getting supplies now for sure!
<human> That is a lot of work! But I bet the reunion will be fun.  <endOfText>
<bot> My family's reunions are incredibly memorable. I volunteered for a lot of desserts so I think it's fair to get started this weekend. I want to be ready.
<human> Yum, I love making and also eating desserts! Do you have a specialty? <endOfText>
<bot> I'm glad you asked! I make a mean german chocolate cake everyone raves about. It makes me feel good to help out.
<human> Oh that's one of my faves. My go to is cheesecake.  <endOfText>
<bot> I love cheesecake, I should do that as well.
<human> It's a crowd pleaser. I love the dips and apps at get togethers like that.  <endOfText>

<bot> I am a nurse and I take care of people in the last stage of their lives.
<human> Is that like hospice care? How do you deal with seeing loss so frequently? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes it is. It's really tough. I never stop caring about the loss. It's hard.
<human> I'm sure you do a great job of making these people feel cared for and loved in their final times. <endOfText>
<bot> That's the best part. Some people are in so much pain it's a relief for them to go. Hard on the families though.
<human> I bet it is. Thank you for giving your time to this type of work. <endOfText>
<bot> It's rewarding but also pretty high burn out. I take two really good vacations a year!
<human> You deserve them! That's excellent to hear. <endOfText>

<bot> I went to make a patty melt today and my bread was moldy.
<human> Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that! <endOfText>
<bot> I know! It was a super specific craving I was having too.
<human> The worst! Did you find something else to eat? <endOfText>
<bot> I just had a salad.
<human> Better than nothing but still no patty melt! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! I hate when I'm hungry for something and it goes wrong like that!

<bot> So, my mom invited me and my kids on a road trip.
<human> That's exciting. Is that something you want to do? <endOfText>
<bot> Kind of. I was worried because my husband wouldn't be coming along and my kids are very young, 3 years and 6 months.
<human> That could definitely be tough. Especially with a baby. <endOfText>
<bot> That's exciting. Is that something you want to do?
<human> Kind of. I was worried because my husband wouldn't be coming along and my kids are very young, 3 years and 6 months. <endOfText>
<bot> That could definitely be tough. Especially with a baby.
<human> I definitely had my doubts, especially with the trip being so long. 16 hours in the car! <endOfText>
<bot> I was totally comfortable last night watching a movie with my boyfriend and eating popcorn.
<human> Really, did you get to pick the movie? <endOfText>
<bot> We both agreed on Fight Club.
<human> Oh wow thats always nice when everyone can agree on the same movie. <endOfText>

<human> That's cool, nothing wrong with being faithful.  <endOfText>
<bot> That's always nice, how did you respond?
<human> I told her I had a girlfriend but was flattered  <endOfText>
<bot> This has been such a great summer so far. I just got a new job in June and I bought a new set of wheels this week!
<human> Nice, jobs are ok, but a new ride is really fun. What did you get <endOfText>
<bot> I put money down on a Toyota Tacoma. It wasn't my first choice but it gets the job done for sure.
<human> Toyota's usually last a long time so it might be a good decision. <endOfText>
<bot> Nice, jobs are ok, but a new ride is really fun. What did you get

<bot> Toyota's usually last a long time so it might be a good decision.
<human> That's why I went for it, that engine will last me a very long time. They're very dependable. <endOfText>
<bot> I was talking to my boss and used a word that I didn't know the real meaning of. made a total fool of myself. lol
<human> Wow, was it embarrassing? <endOfText>
<bot> Totally. at least I know what the word means now so I can use it in the future.
<human> Dang! Well at least you got a good story to tell now! <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, was it embarrassing?
<human> Totally. at least I know what the word means now so I can use it in the future. <endOfText>
<bot> We've moved a lot of the past decade for my husband's job.
<human> oh really, hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun. <endOfText>
<bot> yeah, change is so hard for me!  but it's been worth it
<human> Well at least you get to be with the man you love...hopefully <endOfText>
<bot> oh really, hopefully its a pretty nice job cause moving is not fun.
<human> yeah, change is so hard for me!  but it's been worth it <endOfText>
<bot> I just put some snow tires up for sale on the internet. I stopped using Craigslist awhile ago because of some bad experiences so I hope it goes okay.
<human> As long as you're safe about it. You can meet up at police stations too!  <endOfText>
<bot> That was my mistake in the past. I always went to weird locations to exchange things. I have to be smart about it nowadays.
<human> More people are open and into it so yo ucan always talk to your police about it <endOfText>

<human> That is true! Thanks for your advice. I want to be more open to selling stuff on the web to strangers for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> I've been married to the same person for over 34 years
<human> Wow. That's a long time. Longer than I've been alive! Congrats on your successful marriage. Got any tips? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, be fully committed, communicate about everything & let petty things roll right off.
<human> Thanks for the advice. I have trouble letting the petty things go but I think I'll learn to be better as time goes by. I wish you a happy marriage!  <endOfText>

<human> Thanks! You can do it! With the right person, it's not as hard as it seems. So I guess the real secret is to find the right person from the start. ;) <endOfText>
<bot> My heart sank when I heard about my favorite teacher from elementary school passing away.
<human> Ohhhh, that's so sad. I remember (long ago) when that happened to me. Did he/she live a good long life? <endOfText>
<bot> I hope so. I heard it was cancer. He was always such a happy man. It's a shame.
<human> Yeah, that is a shame. I'm so sorry to hear about your loss. I know how important a great teacher can be your life. <endOfText>
<bot> Ohhhh, that's so sad. I remember (long ago) when that happened to me. Did he/she live a good long life?

<human> Thanks for the kind words. He was a lot older than me so I hope he lived a great life.  <endOfText>
<bot> I need to past a test next week but since I am well prepared I believe I will have no trouble doing it.
<human> Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability? <endOfText>
<bot> I am feeling pretty good about it since I think I am very well prepared.
<human> Do make sure to get a good nights sleep before hand. That is just as important. <endOfText>
<bot> Are you nervous? Or do you have amazing confidence in your ability?
<human> I am feeling pretty good about it since I think I am very well prepared. <endOfText>
<bot> My husband and I decided we wanted a night to ourselves, but we've never let our son stay the night anywhere. I was pretty nervous.
<human> How old is your son? <endOfText>
<bot> He's 3 now, but at the time he was about one and a half. We decided to let him stay with his grandparents that night.
<human> I can understand why you felt so nervous. A mothers attachment is rather strong to a newborn. You should get him a gaurd dog when he's a bit older if you still feel that way. <endOfText>
<bot> How old is your son?
<human> He's 3 now, but at the time he was about one and a half. We decided to let him stay with his grandparents that night. <endOfText>
<bot> I've spent at least an hour a day on overwatch for the past 3 months. Altogether I have roughly 90 hours this season
<human> Wow! I enjoy watching Overwatch on Twitch occasionally. Would you say that's your favorite game? <endOfText>
<bot> I would say it's my favorite fps now by a mile. Cod became fecal matter 5 or 6 years ago. I'm hoping I can finally stop being a pleb and hit diamond next season
<human> I never got into COD and I tried Overwatch when it first came out but I wasn't very good. Fortnite on the other hand I'm alright at.  <endOfText>

<bot> I recently renovated my home and it's so nice to be done with all the work!
<human> That's awesome! What did you have done? <endOfText>
<bot> We painted, bought new furniture and installed new tile and light fixtures. It's so relaxing to be able to sit back and enjoy the new space we worked so hard to create!
<human> I can imagine. Things like are always so stressful, but so nice once they are completed. <endOfText>

<bot> I just moved back near family, and I'm feeling overwhelmed with how close knit everything is again.
<human> Oh I feel you! Every time I go back to stay with my family it feels... claustrophobic almost. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm very lucky to be back and around them though. They are truly generous people.
<human> I'm sure they are! Itll feel more normal soon, I am sure <endOfText>

<human> I can't wait. They can really help me get through some tough times. They're always there. <endOfText>
<bot> I have to go get my tooth pulled soon. I hate the dentist
<human> What's wrong with your tooth? I hope it's not too painful of an experience. <endOfText>
<bot> It's an impacted wisdom tooth, it is stuck under my gum line
<human> Yikes! I've had that before. My thoughts are with you. I'm sure the dentist will take care of it though. <endOfText>

<bot> My brother told me that he won a 75" TV from work. He says it looks good with his new Xbox!
<human> Interest are you going to try and get him to sell it? <endOfText>
<bot> No, I have no where to put it but I'm going to his house to watch football for sure.
<human> That will be fun, maybe he will even let you play his xbox on it. <endOfText>

<human> He better! <endOfText>
<bot> I am old enough to remember the times before internet and social media when people you spoke over the phone or in person.
<human> Same. When you had one phone in the middle of the house with the SUPER long phone cord so you could at least get around the corner to talk. <endOfText>
<bot> That's it!  I guess I miss having what I believe where much more  meaningful contacts with people on a daily basis.
<human> I agree. The convenience is nice now, but the quality is much lower. <endOfText>

<bot> My wife's grandmother passed on a couple weeks ago. It's still eating at me to think about it.
<human> Were you close to your wife's grandmother? <endOfText>
<bot> I had become close to her as of late. She was a very strong and respected woman.
<human> That is very heartbreaking. Im sure she had a very positive opinion of you as well. <endOfText>
<bot> I think she did. We got along very well and she was always happy to see me.
<human> Im sure your wife also appreciates you getting along with her family. <endOfText>

<bot> My daily life consists of getting up, going to work or going to college. I miss being young and spending my day playing videogames and playing outside
<human> Those times seemed much simpler didn't they? Do you ever break out of the routine? <endOfText>
<bot> If im not studying or working I usually go out for a run, practice piano or do surveys online to make some extra cash
<human> I see. How do you like playing the piano? <endOfText>
<bot> Its hard at first, but with practice comes perfection.
<human> That's the spirit. I bet you're a wonderful pianist. <endOfText>
<bot> Those times seemed much simpler didn't they? Do you ever break out of the routine?
<human> If im not studying or working I usually go out for a run, practice piano or do surveys online to make some extra cash <endOfText>
<bot> I see. How do you like playing the piano?
<human> Its hard at first, but with practice comes perfection. <endOfText>
<bot> Even when it has been a rough year, I am now feeling that things are beginning to go my way and I can expect good thing for the future.

<bot> I haven't slept well this week at all. The county has been drilling outside my house for 12 hours a day.
<human> Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for? <endOfText>
<bot> They're ripping up the road to just re-do. I'm not saying it's unnecessary but it's sure driving me nutty!
<human> Are they almost done with it? <endOfText>
<bot> Well that stinks.  What are they drilling for?
<human> They're ripping up the road to just re-do. I'm not saying it's unnecessary but it's sure driving me nutty! <endOfText>
<bot> Are they almost done with it?
<human> I'm not sure! Nobody has been able to give me a clear answer, not even the workers outside. <endOfText>
<bot> I really though I was going to be accepted in med school, but I wasn't.
<human> Oh no what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> I don't know and now I don't know what I am going to do with my life either.

<bot> I'm waiting to hear back from the nursing program I applied to for my degree
<human> That's exciting and nerve wracking at the same time I bet. How do you feel about it? <endOfText>
<bot> I think I will get in since my board exam score is good, and my GPA is high. I don't want to be too confident though! I heard the program is competitive.
<human> For sure. Well good luck! Nurses are very under-appreciated. I hope you get. <endOfText>

<human> They really are. Thanks! <endOfText>
<bot> I'm much better off now but I just got out of a time of my life where I was isolated out in a rural area away from a lot of people.
<human> that can be tough but it also can be great to have time for yourself <endOfText>
<bot> At first I felt that way, but over a period of time it can get very overwhelming.
<human> i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed <endOfText>

<bot> My boss is coming for dinner tonight with his wife.
<human> Oh that's exciting. Are you nervous to have them over? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes I am. Many things could go wrong I hope they don't or I probably won't be getting a raise and worse still I will be to embarrassed to ask for it.
<human> I bet it's all in your head. I am sure it will all good smooth. <endOfText>

<human> Aww that's so cute! Was it tough trying to get it to swim? <endOfText>

<bot> Last night I was running in the road in a very lonely place and a car began to follow me slowly.
<human> That's so creepy and scary. What happened next? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, thank god I just took a picture of the car and pretend to be sending it and the car just went away quickly.
<human> Why are there so many weirdos in this world? I'm glad you made it out safe. <endOfText>

<human> What for? I hope it wasn't for anything dangerous. <endOfText>
<bot> Cops brought her home this morning. She was still drunk from the party she went to.
<human> That's a little dangerous. I'd definitely talk to her about why you didn't allow her to go to that party, and maybe she'll realize that what you're doing is for her own good. <endOfText>

<human> I agree, needless to say, she is grounded til Thanksgiving. <endOfText>
<bot> I want to lose wait and I'm trying to eat less, but just a few minutes ago a had some sugar cravings and ate a whole package of cookies.
<human> Yes I understand!  It is so hard to lose weight! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, and now I feel awful about eating those cookies.
<human> Yes.  Chocolate is my nemesis.  I think it is more addicting than cocaine <endOfText>

<human> Yes, and now I feel awful about eating those cookies. <endOfText>
<bot> Last year I was about to run my first 50 mile race.  I had broken my toes a few weeks before and wasn't sure I was going to make it.
<human> Ouch, that's unfortunate. Hopefully it turned out okay though? <endOfText>
<bot> It did, thankfully I had listened to my doctor's recommendations and it healed up just enough.  It was still a pretty nerve wracking start though.

<bot> When I was a kid I threw a rock at a boy. It hit him on the forehead and made a big gash. I felt so bad about doing it.
<human> Oh no! Did you get in trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> It's hard to believe but I didn't. I honestly didn't think it would hit him. He had been fighting with my little brother and I was just trying to scare him off.
<human> Good for you for standing up for your little brother. hope the kid is ok though. <endOfText>

<bot> I was looking through my old family album and realized I had a really good childhood.
<human> Sometimes when you are looking back at a situation you get a whole new perspective now that you're away from it. I'm happy that you have that realization. <endOfText>
<bot> Me too. Makes me really miss my family.
<human> Are they gone now or is a reunion possible? <endOfText>

<human> Amen. What kind of dogs do yo have? <endOfText>
<bot> A boston terrier and a chihuhua cross.
<human> Aw little guys. Do they walk well on the leash? <endOfText>
<bot> Most of the time, until we see another dog.
<human> That's about how mine is. He is a bit bigger so he pulls a little harder. I found using a harness has helped. <endOfText>

<bot> A bad storm with a tornado almost went through my town, I was so scared
<human> I'm glad it's over and nothing happened. do you have an underground shelter? <endOfText>

<human> Oh no! Not the old pop on the rug trick. Did you yell? <endOfText>
<bot> It was too late. He did know I was mad at him. I could tell he knew he did wrong.

<bot> I felt so badly today because my son overheard me yelling and cursing out his dad because he was late picking up our son.  I didn't mean for him to overhear that but I was really angry.
<human> Aw that's tough!  Have you talked to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> I haven't had a chance yet since he's still with his dad.  I hope to call him later tonight.
<human> It might have upset him but I'm sure he'll understand!  Everyone loses their temper sometimes and it's not like you didn't have a legit reason <endOfText>
<bot> Aw that's tough!  Have you talked to him about it?
<human> I haven't had a chance yet since he's still with his dad.  I hope to call him later tonight.  <endOfText>
<bot> We're waiting to see what size my husband's bonus will be.  This is the first year he's eligible for anything bigger than a Starbucks gift card lol
<human> I hope it's a lot more than just a gift card but at least Starbucks should be a lot of money because it's so expensive there! <endOfText>
<bot> haha true, prices are insane there!  We're hoping to be able to afford a new roof this year
<human> oh yes then you need much more than a starbucks gift card!  good luck!! <endOfText>

<bot> When I was younger, my best friend and I worked together.  She ended up getting the promotion that we both wanted.
<human> I am sorry that must have been tough.  She probably felt bad for you. <endOfText>
<bot> I'd been working there longer so it really stung.  Our friendship survived though!
<human> That is great because friendships are very important <endOfText>

<bot> Someone at my work missed part of their shift due to a personal issue, but requested I withhold any information that would reveal they missed such time
<human> Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it? <endOfText>
<bot> I did my best to speak around the subject to anyone that may have otherwise brought it up, Luckily no one ended up being at all the wiser
<human> Sounds like a great way of handling a potentially sticky situation - good job! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! That must have put you in a bad position. How did you handle it?

<bot> I wanted to go out but I couldn't take my small kids. I hadn't ever had a babysitter but I knew my sister would take good care of them.
<human> I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger!  <endOfText>
<bot> They did great. I knew I was worried for nothing!
<human> Oh that's so great - and now you can feel comfortable leaving them with her more often! <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sure it was scary to leave your kids for the time but at least it was their aunt and not a stranger!
<human> They did great. I knew I was worried for nothing! <endOfText>
<bot> All my friends signed up for horse back riding lessons but I'd never been before and was scared.  They convinced me to sign up and take them!
<human> It does sound like fun, though. Did you have a good time? <endOfText>
<bot> I wouldn't say it was a good time but I'm glad I tried it!
<human> Are you ever going to do it again or are you done? I went when I was a child.  <endOfText>
<bot> It does sound like fun, though. Did you have a good time?
<human> I wouldn't say it was a good time but I'm glad I tried it! <endOfText>
<bot> If we can believe and trust in each other,the world will be a better place
<human> True. Easier said than done though. How can we be? <endOfText>
<bot> Is not an easy task but we can try
<human> Definetly! it starts with a single person right <endOfText>
<bot> True. Easier said than done though. How can we be?

<human> Honestly,i was just lucky not to be among <endOfText>
<bot> I had an okay job, not a great job but it paid well, working as a commercial truck and trailer repair technician. After a few weeks on the job I fell into a deep depression after getting injured at work.
<human> oh I am so sorry, I am assuming the injury was serious? <endOfText>
<bot> No, it was minor. I had a previous injury to my arm, not sure what is messed up in it really... Doctor said it was just a sprained wrist but it was obivously more serious, the doctor didn't really care.
<human> oh man I hope you got a second opinion? I would be so worried about your injury. I am so sorry. <endOfText>

<bot> oh man I hope you got a second opinion? I would be so worried about your injury. I am so sorry.
<human> I haven't gotten it looked at since, it doesn't bother me enough to warrant spending the money on the doctor visit. It's alright for the most part now, thank you for your concern. My shoulder and elbow pop consistently but it rarely aches these days, though using the computer mouse can give me fits if I don't watch it. <endOfText>
<bot> i farted in a barnes and noble once and someone smelled it.
<human> Hasn't everyone done so at some point? <endOfText>
<bot> haha I guess so. But they knew it was me...
<human> Atleast it wasn't in class at a college or something, right? <endOfText>
<bot> yeah you're right I shouldn't feel so bad then.
<human> I wouldn't sweat it, chances are you won't see any of those people again right? Even if you do, it's unlikely they'll remember you let alone your smelly fart. <endOfText>
<bot> Hasn't everyone done so at some point?
<human> haha I guess so. But they knew it was me... <endOfText>
<bot> Atleast it wasn't in class at a college or something, right?
<human> yeah you're right I shouldn't feel so bad then. <endOfText>
<bot> I was looking through pictures of when my kids were young. I can't believe how tiny they were. It made me remember the times when they were tiny.
<human> oh my gosh that's so cute! I bet they were the cutest. <endOfText>
<bot> They were so sweet and little. Time passes so quickly.
<human> I'm sure it does, I don't have any of my own but I would be really sentimental. <endOfText>
<bot> oh my gosh that's so cute! I bet they were the cutest.
<human> They were so sweet and little. Time passes so quickly.  <endOfText>
<bot> I am worried about going back to school, I don't know if I should do it. It can be hard.
<human> Yes, but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Don't let fear stop you! <endOfText>
<bot> you're right! I guess I am just very cautious you know.
<human> I know, but I'm sure you'll do great! I went to school for many years through a Master's degree, and although it was hard, it was worth it.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, but think of all the opportunities it can open up. Don't let fear stop you!
<human> you're right! I guess I am just very cautious you know. <endOfText>
<bot> I spent 2 hours helping my daughter with her homework. I found out today she never turned it in.
<human> Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in? <endOfText>
<bot> She just didn't bother. She won't even get credit for turning it in late. What a waste of time.
<human> Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework. Not many parents do that for their children <endOfText>
<bot> Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in?

<human> No, your right. That is so true. I just wish she put more effort into school instead of talking in class. <endOfText>
<bot> I had just went on my break after a long morning at work, so I got chipotle. As soon as I stepped out of my car with my food, I dropped my bowl on the floor
<human> oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on? <endOfText>
<bot> It was pretty heartbreaking honestly, I really looked forward to my steak bowl. I just ended up getting some chips from the vending machine to fill my stomach at least a bit
<human> That is heartbreaking. That sounds really good. Never purchased one of those. <endOfText>
<bot> oh no! I bet you were so mad! were you able to find something else to snack on?

<bot> It is good to remain faithful if you are married. Faith and trust are important in a healthy relationship.
<human> I am completely agree.  How long have you been married? <endOfText>
<bot> I have been married for 14 years now. We've had our ups and downs, but a good relationship takes work.
<human> Constant work and attention is key to a great relationship! <endOfText>
<bot> I am completely agree.  How long have you been married?
<human> I have been married for 14 years now. We've had our ups and downs, but a good relationship takes work. <endOfText>
<bot> Constant work and attention is key to a great relationship!
<human> Compromise an important part, too. It can't work if someone insists on being right all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> I broke my glasses so I had to wear an old pair that had visible scratches on the lenses from being stored in a drawer.
<human> That sucks.  I hate having scratched glasses <endOfText>
<bot> Well, it felt so self-conscious knowing that people could probably see the scratches.
<human> Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches. <endOfText>
<bot> That sucks.  I hate having scratched glasses
<human> Well, it felt so self-conscious knowing that people could probably see the scratches. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes and it always bothers me looking through scatches.
<human> That part sucked too. Guess I care too much what others think. <endOfText>
<bot> I am going through a breakup, we were together for five years I am heartbroken
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain. <endOfText>
<bot> it's horrible. I know you felt the same way. I just want this terrible feeling to be over.
<human> It takes awhile for it to be over. Find a hobby to take your mind off of it. It helps to ease the pain. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm so sorry to hear that. I was together with my wife for 7 years when she left me so I know your pain.
<human> it's horrible. I know you felt the same way. I just want this terrible feeling to be over. <endOfText>
<bot> You ever have a situation where you help someone out and just end up regretting it?
<human> yes, that is always a hard situation.   <endOfText>
<bot> Yea, I once let this guy crash on my couch rent free for 3 months, and the entire time he was taking money out my room and eating my snacks without saying anything. I knew things were missing, but he'd always deny it.
<human> oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry <endOfText>
<bot> yes, that is always a hard situation.

<bot> oh man that is horrible!  I am so sorry
<human> Thanks, I guess some people are just scumbags. I don't understand how you can take advantage of someone who is helping you. <endOfText>
<bot> An old friend wanted to get together. IT was a guy, and he was someone I was involved with. I knew it would bother my husband so I didn't meet with him.
<human> That's the best decision. I know mine wouldn't either. If he is a good guy, he will understand. <endOfText>
<bot> I didn't want to make my husband uncomfortable, even if it would have been nice to catch up. But I have to respect him.
<human> That's good. No sense in rocking the boat. <endOfText>

<bot> I have to go to the dentist really soon. One of my teeth are really sensitive lately.
<human> It is definitely good to get that looked at right away. Then they can take care of it! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, that is true. I am one of those people who hate the dentist.
<human> Oh I know it's hard. Just try to relax and it will go quick.  <endOfText>

<bot> I have meditated nearly every day this year. It was my new years resolution.
<human> Nice! Did it help you become less stressed? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes! It is surprising how much it has helped me considering how neurotic I can be.
<human> Dang, well I hope you can continue your goal of meditating every day! <endOfText>
<bot> Nice! Did it help you become less stressed?
<human> Yes! It is surprising how much it has helped me considering how neurotic I can be. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, I'm not sure if I could do that. Did you feel scared?
<human> Scared of what <endOfText>
<bot> Of doing a trust fall, I guess I forgot to mention that part.
<human> Oh,dont mind me,just been curious <endOfText>
<bot> Scared of what
<human> Of doing a trust fall, I guess I forgot to mention that part. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh,dont mind me,just been curious
<human> No worries, was just thinking back to when a group of my friend when to scout camp and were doing trust exercises.  <endOfText>
<bot> I dont like borrowing from people
<human> Why is that? <endOfText>
<bot> I like to manage whatever i have
<human> I feel that, plus it's nice not to have to worry about returning it. <endOfText>
<bot> Why is that?
<human> I like to manage whatever i have <endOfText>
<bot> I asked my son to clean the kitchen. He left dirty dishes in the sink and garbage on the counter.

<bot> Do you like theme park rides? I used to enjoy them a lot, but one time my ride got stuck.
<human> I think theme park rides are scary! Was it scary when you were stuck? <endOfText>
<bot> It really was, I was freaking out, but I also felt confident that we'd be saved. It didn't take too long, maybe 5-10 minutes before they were able to rescue us.
<human> They are really good about that. They have a lot of safety features you don't even realize. We were stuck on Space Mountain once.  <endOfText>

<bot> When he was little, my nephew was so adorable. He was the first child in the family for a long time, and he was so cute. I loved to spend time with him.
<human> Awww, you're speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore? <endOfText>
<bot> Oh he's still nice. He has some issues, though, but I love him very much of course.
<human> That's depressing to here. I have family members who are still cool now as well, but I just think so fondly on when they were younger. They grow up too fast, and it really is amazing when they're young and innocent and haven't been exposed to the real world yet. <endOfText>
<bot> Awww, you're speaking fondly on when he was young. Is he not as nice anymore?
<human> Oh he's still nice. He has some issues, though, but I love him very much of course. <endOfText>
<bot> Intuition can be a key tool to a seasoned nurse.
<human> I suppose, but research and concrete knowledge is more beneficial as it is a very hands on and physical occupation, especially when the health of others are in their hands. <endOfText>
<bot> Those are very beneficial tools as well but sometimes experience plays a large part in patient outcomes.
<human> That is true. There are many situations where experience can strengthen your skills compared to just learning it from a book. <endOfText>

<bot> It's always such a great feeling whenever I get home and my dog is there waiting for me at the door ready to greet me.
<human> Dogs are wonderful pets. They are so loving and devoted. What kind of dog do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> I have a little havanese named Yoko.

<bot> Hi, I want to tell you about one time my faith was tested. Have you ever had a time when you had to just put your faith in God?
<human> all the time I am not sure I believe in God <endOfText>
<bot> I can understand that. That's why I said my faith was tested...when my husband and I were younger couple with small kids, we were living on a small budget. My husband was still in college to be a teacher, so it was pretty tight with just my income. Well, long story short, I wrote a check for $40 as tithe at church and that was pretty much all we had. A few days later I received a care package from my mom out of blue and she even included some cash. It was not something she usually did. What do you think of that?
<human> that's pretty crazy you could of had your money and the care package too <endOfText>
<bot> Yup, sometimes you just have to believe, I think. But I did feel convicted to do so. I'm not saying everyone should do it. You know what I mean?
<human> yeah I understand what you mean definitely <endOfText>

<bot> Ugh. My boss called me into his office today...and he didn't even give a reason.
<human> Oh wow. I would hate that. What ended up being the issue? <endOfText>
<bot> Something lame -- he wanted to see if I completed a poster he wanted. Why couldn't he have asked that over the phone?
<human> Maybe he has forgotten how it feels to randomly be called into your bosses office. He's moved on up. <endOfText>

<bot> I worked so hard on my science project in school. I thought I was going to get first place. I didn't and was so upset.
<human> What a bummer! What place did you end up getting? <endOfText>
<bot> I got second place, but I was so upset I didn't get first, it might as well have been last. I was young.
<human> I know the feeling. You work so hard just to feel crushed. <endOfText>

<human> Hey,were you injured? <endOfText>
<bot> No I was fine, just my pride was wounded. Of course, being a human being and not a robot I was overwhelmed by the lie. I fessed up to them eventually.

<human> Oh my gosh! Have they broken it? That would drive me nuts. <endOfText>
<bot> It's been knocked down a few times yes. Police have been involved but they don't do anything. My neighbor is so carefree about it too, it's bonkers!
<human> Have you spoken to them personally? Maybe they should pay for you to move it! <endOfText>
<bot> We've "chatted" about it for sure. Like I said, the guy doesn't really care. Very unnerving.

<bot> Hi, a few years ago, my husband got a job offer in Hawaii. We LOVE Hawaii, but we didn't know anyone there and you know how expensive it is to live there. We really had to think about that move...
<human> Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, but we did move and it ended up the best decision ever! We had so much fun and really loved living there. At least beaches are always free!
<human> You sound so excited about it and your future there. I would be full of joy as well. <endOfText>
<bot> Sounds like a real hard decision. I would be very apprehensive as well.
<human> Yeah, but we did move and it ended up the best decision ever! We had so much fun and really loved living there. At least beaches are always free! <endOfText>
<bot> my friend joined the airforce and became an air traffic controller.
<human> That sounds like some good work experience. How long is he in. <endOfText>

<human> Well, hopefully he is as good as Sherlock Holmes and saves some lives. <endOfText>

<bot> A guy asked me on a date one, knowing I was married.  I denied, of course, but was shocked that he didn't care that I was in a monogamous relationship.
<human> That's the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something. <endOfText>
<bot> Or boost his ego? Either way, he didn't succeed.
<human> Good! I don't know why people think they can get away with things like that. <endOfText>
<bot> That's the worst. I wonder if he was trying to prove something.
<human> Or boost his ego? Either way, he didn't succeed. <endOfText>
<bot> I had my first professional interview recently!
<human> congrats, how did you handle the pressure? <endOfText>
<bot> Pretty well I think! I had a solid resume, and I practiced ahead of time. It still isn't the same though when you're right there in the room and they're looking at you lol.
<human> It can be pretty nerve racking, but it is always great practice. You will only get better. <endOfText>

<human> OMG! especially recently. a week seems like one day. <endOfText>

<human> Oh not much. I got a crappy text from a friend the other day! I never have friend drama so it's really sucky. <endOfText>
<bot> I just moved to a new town recently and I finally made a new friend! I was starting to feel really lonely so it's nice to feel like I might fit in.
<human> Way to go! If it makes you feel better I would be your friend if I was there <endOfText>
<bot> Aw, thank you! Do you live in a small town? It's very hard to make connections!
<human> I used to, but yeah especially if you're not in school <endOfText>

<human> What is she going to do there, sounds kind of dangerous. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow Brazil? Isn't there a lot of crime there?
<human> I don't know... I hope not for her sake. I was really hoping she'd stay here but I'm also really excited for her. <endOfText>
<bot> What is she going to do there, sounds kind of dangerous.
<human> She is starting a missionary school! <endOfText>
<bot> When I was 13 I was baptized. In water, not milk. But if I was baptized in milk it would be whole milk.
<human> That's good, how does that make you feel <endOfText>
<bot> Honestly? Not fat.
<human> Nice, I like your attitude <endOfText>
<bot> That's good, how does that make you feel

<human> What are you waiting for? <endOfText>
<bot> Usually it's for my boyfriend to get home so he can spend time with me. poor guy. lol
<human> Oh I totally know how that goes. I moved to small town and didn't have many friends at first. Once I had my son and made more friends it got way better lol! <endOfText>
<bot> What are you waiting for?
<human> Usually it's for my boyfriend to get home so he can spend time with me. poor guy. lol <endOfText>
<bot> Good evening! I moved to a small town recently. It's been tough.
<human> Thanks, you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sure it will. I've already made some friends, but it's definitely difficult to make connections.
<human> Yeah, I think it gets more difficult as you get older anyway. <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks, you as well. I know how that is. give it time and things will get better.
<human> I'm sure it will. I've already made some friends, but it's definitely difficult to make connections. <endOfText>
<bot> I feel soo far away from my family.
<human> Aw, I know how that goes. Do they visit often? <endOfText>

<bot> That's funny, just don't let it in your room while your sleeping!
<human> oh no, no that one. The other one does sleep right next to my head though <endOfText>
<bot> It was such a nerve wrecking experience when my son was first born, I really was so scared that anything could hurt him!
<human> Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump. <endOfText>
<bot> I know, right, and I had this nurse tell me the first week he was alive, that babies have died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome right in their parents arm! It was so scary
<human> It's a pretty small percentage, but it would definitely be something to worry about. <endOfText>
<bot> Babies are pretty small and delicate they look like they might break at the slightest bump.
<human> I know, right, and I had this nurse tell me the first week he was alive, that babies have died of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome right in their parents arm! It was so scary <endOfText>
<bot> My friend recently told me that she couldn't have kids, I tried my hardest to be there for her
<human> Wow that would be terrible news. I can't imaged shit is taking it well. <endOfText>
<bot> She is not at all, I have really been there for her, I have two boys of my own and could not imagine not being able to have kids of my own
<human> Hopefully she has a supportive partner to help her as well. Glad you are there to help her. <endOfText>

<human> She is not at all, I have really been there for her, I have two boys of my own and could not imagine not being able to have kids of my own <endOfText>
<bot> One night my cats were chasing a fly in the house. All of a sudden, one of them started acting weird and then he died. He was only a kitten. I was so upset.
<human> That is horrible, I am so sorry, It is hard losing a baby animal, you are not expecting them to pass, like when you have an older sickly one <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, it was horrible. It just happened out of nowhere.
<human> That is crazy, I wonder what was wrong with it <endOfText>
<bot> The vet said it was likely an anneurysm.
<human> Wow, I never knew cats could even get an aneurysm, but I guess like humans why wouldn't they be able to? <endOfText>
<bot> That is horrible, I am so sorry, It is hard losing a baby animal, you are not expecting them to pass, like when you have an older sickly one
<human> Yes, it was horrible. It just happened out of nowhere. <endOfText>
<bot> That is crazy, I wonder what was wrong with it
<human> The vet said it was likely an anneurysm. <endOfText>
<bot> I am so happy with my life currently, I am able to stay at home with my children and watch them grow, I would not change it for anything
<human> Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> I have 2 little boys aged 2 and 4, soon to be 3 and 5 and ugh it can be challenging at times, but totally worth it!
<human> It definitely can be a challenge. I have a 10 year old boy, an 8 year old girl, and a 2 year old girl. I love being home with them. <endOfText>
<bot> Ahhhh thats amazing! I stay home with my kids too! How many kids do you have?
<human> I have 2 little boys aged 2 and 4, soon to be 3 and 5 and ugh it can be challenging at times, but totally worth it! <endOfText>
<bot> I went out to the bar recently with my girlfriends and it was kind of an annoying experience.
<human> Oh no, what happened? Did they do or say something? <endOfText>
<bot> It's just so frustrating going out when you are in a happily committed relationship and getting hit on. Especially when you tell the men straight up you are involved with someone else!
<human> Oh girl, that happens to me all the time too. So frustrating, just leave us alone. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, what happened? Did they do or say something?
<human> It's just so frustrating going out when you are in a happily committed relationship and getting hit on. Especially when you tell the men straight up you are involved with someone else! <endOfText>
<bot> My grandma was diagnosed with dementia a few years ago. She recently moved in with my dad. I went and stayed with them to take care of her.
<human> I'm sorry, is it difficult to take care of her? <endOfText>
<bot> I went to school to be a CNA. So the actual taking care of her was not difficult. I think it was more mentally difficult. It was all day and all night. Very exhausting.
<human> Dang, I hope everything turns out okay for you guys <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry, is it difficult to take care of her?
<human> I went to school to be a CNA. So the actual taking care of her was not difficult. I think it was more mentally difficult. It was all day and all night. Very exhausting. <endOfText>

<human> Unfortunately she wont get better. She will be moving into a nursing home in a couple of weeks. I think it will be good for her. <endOfText>
<bot> I have never cheated on a girlfriend

<bot> Yes im kinda proud of it
<human> Keep it up brochacho <endOfText>
<bot> Good to hear that you keep your word
<human> Yes im kinda proud of it <endOfText>
<bot> I felt so ashamed the time that I took money from my parents. I couldn't look them in the eyes for weeks when I was younger.
<human> At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah... I don't know. They still support me and help me, but I still feel incredibly guilty. Not sure what to do to make it up to them.
<human> Confess to them what happened. Let them know how you have changed. <endOfText>
<bot> At least that shows that you have a conscience. I hope that you made it up to them.
<human> Yeah... I don't know. They still support me and help me, but I still feel incredibly guilty. Not sure what to do to make it up to them. <endOfText>
<bot> I took the kids to visit the residents at the Veterans Home. We made some special treats to take to them.
<human> Wow, I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them? <endOfText>
<bot> A variety of things that they liked. I checked ahead of time to see what they would want.
<human> So thoughtful of you! What did the kids think of visiting the veterans? <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, I am sure the Veterans loved it! What kind of treats did you and the kids bring to them?
<human> A variety of things that they liked. I checked ahead of time to see what they would want. <endOfText>
<bot> I called in sick to work, so I could go Christmas shopping...they were having a great sale at the mall.
<human> Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead. <endOfText>
<bot> Well, yeah, it's good to plan ahead, but I kept looking over my shoulder...I felt so guilty!
<human> Yeah spending money on things is always a temporary high. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow that is some really early christmas shopping. you must like to plan ahead.
<human> Well, yeah, it's good to plan ahead, but I kept looking over my shoulder...I felt so guilty! <endOfText>
<bot> I made a big pot of Vegetable soup. After eating a big bowl I was completely satisfied and just wanted to nap in my chair.
<human> I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ? <endOfText>
<bot> Oh yeah, It felt so good.
<human> Well I'm happy for you. Its hard to catch a nap around here sometimes. <endOfText>
<bot> I love vegetable soup. So were you able to enjoy your nap ?
<human> Oh yeah, It felt so good.  <endOfText>
<bot> My girlfriend is always worrying if I am as happy thought I would be after we decided to go from just good friends to be in a relationship with each other.  I always am honest and tell her the same thing.
<human> Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved. <endOfText>
<bot> well really we have deeply involed for along time now . And I am very happy in our relationship and couldn't ask for anything more out of it.
<human> Maybe you couldn't but it sounds like something is going on with her.  <endOfText>
<bot> Sounds like she has some underlying issues with trust. You may want to sort it all out before you get too involved.

<bot> My friend recently lended me their car so I can go out of town
<human> That was nice of them. Did you have any problems with their car? <endOfText>
<bot> They did not hesitate to lend me the car at all which is nice. No, I did not have any problems with the car.
<human> THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car? <endOfText>
<bot> That was nice of them. Did you have any problems with their car?
<human> They did not hesitate to lend me the car at all which is nice. No, I did not have any problems with the car.  <endOfText>
<bot> THat is good to hear. What happened to your own car?
<human> My car was getting repaired.  <endOfText>
<bot> When my nephew's car broke down and I loaned him my car, I know that he'll be careful with it.
<human> Well at least you can trust him to be careful.  I dont think I would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, 18 is an inherently irresponsible time, mine is 24 and getting married soon so that makes a lot of difference.
<human> Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females.    <endOfText>
<bot> Well at least you can trust him to be careful.  I dont think I would be able to trust my nephew as he is only 18 and not very responsible yet.
<human> Yeah, 18 is an inherently irresponsible time, mine is 24 and getting married soon so that makes a lot of difference. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes its amazing how much of  a difference a few years can make in age.  It seems that males take quite awile long to mature than females.
<human> The culture that extends adolescence deep into their twenties doesn't help much either.  <endOfText>
<bot> Long time ago, we saw a driver throw a kitten out of his car window. We picked him up and brought him home.
<human> That's so nice of you, I would have chased down the car, but you did the right thing <endOfText>
<bot> He was such a sweet kitten. We had him for years. He's gone now and miss him still.
<human> Feels bad, hope you have someone to talk about it with! <endOfText>
<bot> That's so nice of you, I would have chased down the car, but you did the right thing
<human> He was such a sweet kitten. We had him for years. He's gone now and miss him still. <endOfText>
<bot> My husband has a job interview coming up and we re really hoping he'd get the job.
<human> What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it! <endOfText>
<bot> It's for health care company. It'll be a better job for him. Thank you.
<human> THats awesome, does it pay better than the one he has?  A pay increase is certainly helpful. <endOfText>
<bot> What kind of job is it?   I will keep my fingers crossed he gets it!
<human> It's for health care company. It'll be a better job for him. Thank you. <endOfText>
<bot> I had my eye on a pretty new shirt that I wanted to get. My sister got it and it looked great on her. I was so envious.
<human> oh wow i am glad she was happy, why were you nervous? <endOfText>
<bot> I wasn't nervous I was envious. I had really wanted it.
<human> oh don't be, you should be happy for her, there will come a time where you will get something back in return :) <endOfText>
<bot> oh wow i am glad she was happy, why were you nervous?
<human> I wasn't nervous I was envious. I had really wanted it. <endOfText>

<human> A big fat ZERO! I need one now! Haha! <endOfText>
<bot> Have you ever invited someone over for dinner that you liked a whole lot? Well I have and it didn't go to well.
<human> Oh, no! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> Well I made them dinner fixed their plate gave it to them and a folded napkin. When they unfolded the napkin a big fat and I mean fat cock roach fell out and ran across the table at about 50 miles a hour.
<human> Oh wow! That's like the worst nightmare! I'm so sorry that happened to you!! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, no! What happened?
<human> Well I made them dinner fixed their plate gave it to them and a folded napkin. When they unfolded the napkin a big fat and I mean fat cock roach fell out and ran across the table at about 50 miles a hour. <endOfText>
<bot> once i pooped my pants at walmart
<human> Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment? <endOfText>
<bot> My mom was there and i had to ride home with her so yeah she knew
<human> I'm sure that was not a fun ride home.  <endOfText>
<bot> Were you able to get out of there without anybody noticing or did you die from embarssment?
<human> My mom was there and i had to ride home with her so yeah she knew <endOfText>
<bot> I was on the edge of my seat watching the local election results. I was hoping my candidate would win.
<human> where you disappointed?  <endOfText>

<human> I remember the same thing. And the joy that followed for the next moth was pure bliss <endOfText>
<bot> where you disappointed?
<human> No I was quite happy with the results. But the waiting for the results was so nerve wracking. <endOfText>

<bot> I live on the Gulf Coast. When you get the warning you have to be ready.
<human> Alright, so do you ever have to evacuate? <endOfText>
<bot> Where do you live?
<human> I live on the Gulf Coast. When you get the warning you have to be ready. <endOfText>
<bot> I got caught by the train and it made me late for work. I was so mad.
<human> maybe go earlier later? <endOfText>
<bot> That's just it though. You never know when the train is going to be there.
<human> oh, that's kind of weird <endOfText>
<bot> maybe go earlier later?
<human> That's just it though. You never know when the train is going to be there. <endOfText>
<bot> it sucked i was heartbroken but i let her go
<human> ... im sorry, how did it happen <endOfText>

<bot> I knew my wife's family would help us financially for our marriage, turns out it was right, I appreciate it so much.
<human> Nice! The married life is expensive <endOfText>
<bot> Yes well we needed money in order to get married in the first place. All the expenses and fees and paperwork.
<human> I hope you two have a nice future. At least you know the family will support you! <endOfText>
<bot> Nice! The married life is expensive
<human> Yes well we needed money in order to get married in the first place. All the expenses and fees and paperwork. <endOfText>
<bot> There was a time when I really messed up.
<human> Oh! What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> Some folks were counting on me to buy some things, but I never did.
<human> Wow! You lazy bum. You disappointed me too! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh! What happened?
<human> Some folks were counting on me to buy some things, but I never did. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow! You lazy bum. You disappointed me too!
<human> What?  I ordered the items later, but they came later than folks had hoped. <endOfText>
<bot> I behaved immature during the fight lately and lied, later on I felt remorse.
<human> That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged? <endOfText>
<bot> It was my wife, sadly. I explained to her later and admitted my mistake.
<human> Was she understanding and forgiving? <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds awful. Who was it you wronged?
<human> It was my wife, sadly. I explained to her later and admitted my mistake.  <endOfText>
<bot> I quit my job without having another one lined up.  I'm hopeful and optimistic that I will be okay and that this was the right choice.
<human> I'm sure you will be able to get another one fairly quickly! <endOfText>
<bot> I'm doing some work-from-home stuff and it's actually pretty fun!
<human> I hope that you see amazing results, and you continue to enjoy yourself! <endOfText>

<human> I'm doing some work-from-home stuff and it's actually pretty fun! <endOfText>
<bot> I don't know why my boyfriend lied to me about seeing another woman. I thought he loved me.
<human> Do you think it's possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake? <endOfText>
<bot> I'm not sure, but I'm hoping that he will realize he's messed up.
<human> I think that when people cheat and lie, it's because something is wrong with them and not their partner.  If he doesn't realize his mistake, then he doesn't deserve your love.  I wish you all the best! <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you so much. Hopefully, it all works out, and he comes back to me.
<human> I hope you realize your worth too. I do this thing where I think about another woman in my life who I really care about (mom, daughter, etc.) and I think "if this was happening to them, what kind of advice would I give them?"  Sometimes, we think we deserve less. <endOfText>
<bot> Do you think it's possible that he does still love you and also made a horrible mistake?

<bot> im sorry, what did happend next? how does that make you feel?
<human> I was nervous, but had to trust him.  I was afraid he would spend it all or even lose it. <endOfText>
<bot> Hey, guess what, you will not believe what just happened to me.

<bot> That's horrible! Did you have any sort of tracker on it?
<human> No, I have lent my phone out to strangers before, and have never had someone run off with it. Luckily track and field training paid off and I was able to tackle him down <endOfText>
<bot> Lately I was sharing memories with my wife from before we got married and it was heartwarming.
<human> Awwe that is so sweet, how did you two meet?  <endOfText>
<bot> We met online actually! And we were across the ocean from each other. That was a journey.

<human> Mmm that sounds delicious. There is always time to make pancake Tuesdays at home! <endOfText>
<bot> Haha yeah, but it doesn't feel the same because I miss being able to enjoy it with all my classmates. It was always a great time full of laughter and chatter

<bot> Have you ever tried skydiving before?
<human> I haven't, but it's definitely on my bucket list! <endOfText>
<bot> I thought I was going to pee my pants until the instructor told me how many years of experience he has under his belt.
<human> I bet it helped having someone there who knew what they were doing.  <endOfText>
<bot> yeah, it is. 15 years and over 500 jumps helped ease my anxiety lol
<human> I have a friend who recently became certified as an instructor. He jumps almost every weekend. He will be taking me when I go! <endOfText>

<bot> I let a stranger borrow my cellphone to make a phone call, but he ended up dashing off with my phone
<human> Oh no! I would have been furious! Were you able to catch him? <endOfText>

<bot> Really? I did not know such laws exist but it's awesome. Where do you live?

<human> That is is true.  I am up thinking about my relationship with my deceased wife. <endOfText>
<bot> The first night I finally moved into my new place was very nice. I finally had my own spot, to myself, and the means to afford it comfortably.
<human> I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want.   <endOfText>
<bot> It's pretty liberating. Would be hard to come back from that freedom though. Hard to imagine it.
<human> Good or bad I have been in that situation many times.  More recently when I was separated from my current wife.  My own place.  Finally! <endOfText>
<bot> I know the feeling When you finally have your own place to do what you want.
<human> It's pretty liberating. Would be hard to come back from that freedom though. Hard to imagine it. <endOfText>

<human> That sounds like the worst feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> What did you eat?
<human> I ate meal worms! They were still alive and I could feel them crawling in my mouth <endOfText>
<bot> I misunderstood what someone said to me, I tried to help but in turn it all turned out awkward and the conversation went wrong.
<human> ah i know this feeling, how did the conversation go? <endOfText>
<bot> They kind of went off on me ad disagreed. What I said wasn't offensive, just irrelevant though lol.
<human> it's okay, next just tell them that you didn't quiet understand what they meant and so they will explain it again <endOfText>
<bot> ah i know this feeling, how did the conversation go?
<human> They kind of went off on me ad disagreed. What I said wasn't offensive, just irrelevant though lol. <endOfText>
<bot> I was throwing away my old stuff when I came across my old toys but I could not throw them out because they meant so much to me.
<human> You shouldn't be so attached to your old stuff, you might end up a hoarder! <endOfText>
<bot> That is true, they have survived staying with me all these years because they brought me so much joy.
<human> Well that is a good reason to keep holding on to something! <endOfText>

<bot> I am terrified of spiders, one time I saw one on my wall and stared at it for hours to keep track of where it was
<human> What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies, after all.  <endOfText>
<bot> It's all their legs and eyes...*shivers* just imagining it gives me chills up my spine!
<human> True, they aren't a very visually appealing species. But at least they're more afraid of you, that's some consolation.  <endOfText>
<bot> What makes you so afraid of them? They do eat all the other creepy-crawlies, after all.

<bot> When I was in middle school, I remember seeing a question on the board and feeling positive that I knew the answer. When all was quiet and the teacher asked if anyone knew the answer, I confidently spoke up, only to be incorrect
<human> Oh no how did you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> An odd combination of wanting to die, and not wanting to exist. Like, I basically wanted to reverse time.
<human> I totally understand that feeling and know what you mean! But I wouldn't sweat over it, it happens to the best of us and we learn fro our mistakes! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no how did you feel?

<bot> I saw someone who was making much more money than me doing a the same thing as me but a very bad job. But I still wished I was on their place and paid as much
<human> I know what you mean, maybe ask if the place is hiring?  <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah well I'm online entrepreneur so it's more complicated. I don't want to charge as much at the same time. They're kind of scamming people but I still felt envious, then got over it.
<human> ohh okay I see, yeah that is a difficult situation. I hope it works out for you and best of luck buddy! :) <endOfText>

<bot> I had a cancer scare last year.  My doctor found a strange mole. I had to wait a week for the biopsy to come back.  It was a long wait!
<human> I can't imagine what that must have felt like. What helped you get through it? <endOfText>
<bot> Xanax!  Just kidding.  I didn't have much help dealing with it because I didn't tell anyone.
<human> At least you kept your sense of humor!  <endOfText>

<human> In retrospect!  I was pretty freaked out.  My family was mad at me for not telling them, but I didn't want them to worry. <endOfText>
<bot> I felt really guilty when I had to tell my parents I decided to drop out of school.
<human> Did you hear the "You'll be a ditch-digger" speech like my brother did? <endOfText>

<bot> My brother got such a nice Snowboard for his birthday when we were teenagers. I wanted one too, but didn't end up getting what I wanted
<human> That doesn't sound like such a pleasurable memory. Maybe you received a gift your brother always secretly wish he had! <endOfText>
<bot> You know, he played it up like that, seemed really invested in the Bass guitar I got. He sure did enjoy the hell out of that snowboard, though.
<human> You know what they say, the grass is always greener on the other side. Did you ever manage to get him to let you borrow his snowboard? <endOfText>

<human> Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it? <endOfText>
<bot> Quite a few, but I knew most of them. I consider that better than falling in front of a bunch of strangers.

<bot> Oh no! How awkward! did anyone see it?
<human> Quite a few, but I knew most of them. I consider that better than falling in front of a bunch of strangers. <endOfText>

<human> Dealing with kids can be like that. Is there something about doing his hair that he is scared of? <endOfText>
<bot> I think it is just the noise of the buzzer that makes him nervous, but he literally just screams and cries. It definitely doesn't hurt him at all.

<bot> Well, it's a factory job and I'm afraid that the monotony will be too soul-crushing
<human> You do have a good point. You really should do what will make you happy because life is just too short <endOfText>
<bot> Why don't you think it will be a good fit? You might be underestimating yourself

<human> It often made me mad. And it made me not like them . <endOfText>
<bot> I feel like I have let my family down. I got into trouble with the law.
<human> Oh that's not good. What did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> I lied to the cops about something I was questioned about. Truthfully, I didn't want other people to get into trouble. But instead, I was charged with making false statements to the police.
<human> I'm sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best, even if other people might get in trouble. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh that's not good. What did you do?

<bot> I'm sorry you are going through that. Sometimes telling the truth is the best, even if other people might get in trouble.
<human> That is entirely true. I was also worried about retribution from the other people. In the end, telling the truth is better than getting myself into trouble and letting my family down.  <endOfText>
<bot> I haven't been sleeping well for a few days now because my husband was on a 30 hour road trip to get our new puppy.
<human> Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep.  <endOfText>
<bot> That's a great suggestion. Last night I actually did sleep a bit better because I opened the window and was able to listen to outdoor noises like crickets and cicadas.
<human> I love listening to nature. I live in the country, and could not imagine being in the city. I lived there for a few months, but there was too much traffic and noises that kept me up. I moved back to the country.  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh wow. I know being away from our loved ones can make it hard to sleep. Have you tried to listen to nature sounds? I have an app on my phone and I play rain sounds to help me sleep.

<bot> One time I was working on a huge project with a lot of people and made a huge mistake. Another person from another company could have embarassed me, but instead he helped me out and covered for me.
<human> that's nice. i wish i had people like that to work with <endOfText>
<bot> I've never had that happen before either. It was a hostile environment and he certainly didn't have to help me, but he did. I've tried to be more like that since then.
<human> i wonder if he has a crush on you or wants something in return <endOfText>
<bot> Haha. I doubt that. He was halfway around the world. It was a long time ago and he never asked for anything.
<human> did it boost your confidence and faith in mankind? <endOfText>

<human> I'm sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also, Do you have prospects for a future position? <endOfText>
<bot> They did provide severance. I wasn't sure what to do but felt that things would work out
<human> At least they did that much for you. I'm sure you'll land on your feet. You seem like an optimistic type <endOfText>
<bot> Well, actually I did end up getting a job that I like!
<human> That's wonderful! I hope you find fulfillment and a sense of purpose {not to mention a chunky wallet haha} <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks! The wallet's still a bit skinny, but I like the job, though!
<human> Personally, I find that a job you enjoy that gets you by is superior to one that makes you a lot of money at the cost of your happiness <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry to hear that. Did they give you a severance package? Also, Do you have prospects for a future position?

<bot> The other day I was going through my things and I found my old Gamecube. I remember all the fun times I had playing with friends.
<human> Did it make you nostalgic? <endOfText>
<bot> Why certainly! It brought back memories of childhood and how carefree I used to be. I'd love to go back to those times.
<human> I know what you mean, life gets more complicated as you get older :) <endOfText>
<bot> Such is life but, the best we can do is find pieces of the old emotions we cherish in modern item. Like the smell of dishsoap my grandmother used to use.

<human> Oh I see , what happens then? <endOfText>

<human> That's annoying, did you call him after he didn't turn up? <endOfText>

<human> They are good kids. I didn't even have to ask, they just showed up ready to help. <endOfText>
<bot> I spent hours shopping and getting everything I needed. I was finally done and went to the car and dropped my cookies all over the floor. I was so mad at myself!
<human> That sounds frustrating. Did you drop anything else? <endOfText>
<bot> Thankfully no. And next time I went, I bought more cookies!
<human> Well, that's good that it was just the cookies? It could have been much worse. <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds frustrating. Did you drop anything else?
<human> Thankfully no. And next time I went, I bought more cookies! <endOfText>
<bot> I put off changing my kids diaper for 5 minutes. Poop ended up leaking out in front of many other people.
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. With five kids, that has happened to me multiple times. I can commiserate! <endOfText>
<bot> I was picking my oldest up from school. I really thought he'd be fine for 5 minutes.

<bot> Hi there, I have just left my current job in education due to a variety of unpleasant circumstances, with no other job to go into! It's both frightening and liberating!
<human> If you were unhappy, sometimes you just have to make that leap. Now you can explore your options! <endOfText>
<bot> I know - it's getting a bit difficult for money, and I'm struggling to find positions that match my skills, but I'm hopeful that something will come up soon.
<human> Just keep looking. My sister started out with a temp job that has since turned into a well paying permanent job that is even paying for her education.  <endOfText>

<bot> I took my kids to a play area I used to go to as a kid. As I was there, I remembered all the good times that I had there. It was very sweet to remember.
<human> Ah, that's lovely! I have such fond memories of running around in parks as a child. I don't think young people today really understand the value of just running around and playing. <endOfText>
<bot> No, they are always on their screens. There are definitely too many electronics right now!
<human> Absolutely! I used to love computer games too as a kid, but I always knew I had to disconnect with them. And it's so easy for children to access anything, at any time now. Some of the content young people can access is really worrying. It's good that you took your kids to the park, I hope they enjoyed it! <endOfText>

<human> dude i just know what im good at and i don't care what people think <endOfText>
<bot> I started a new job recently at a pretty great restaurant owned by some pretty great people. I then was offered a higher pay by my previous employer to try and persuade me to come back. I had to turn it down, though. My new place is so good, that it would take a lot to make me leave.
<human> Being able to enjoy your workplace is worth it. You're lucky to be in that position <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, it's a rare thing sometimes. I plan to do this until I finish school, so for a little more than a year.
<human> Do you think you'll keep the job after school?  <endOfText>
<bot> Being able to enjoy your workplace is worth it. You're lucky to be in that position
<human> Yeah, it's a rare thing sometimes. I plan to do this until I finish school, so for a little more than a year. <endOfText>
<bot> Do you think you'll keep the job after school?
<human> Probably not, since getting a specific job is the whole reason I'm going to school. <endOfText>
<bot> I tried cooking a new recipe. But it really didn't look good while it was cooking.
<human> Wait untill its done <endOfText>
<bot> I did, although I put some more seasonings in before it was finished.
<human> It will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> Wait untill its done

<human> That's great that she makes you proud. <endOfText>
<bot> Who always made you proud?
<human> My baby sister that came for holidays <endOfText>
<bot> I changed jobs recently. I was a little unsure whether or not I was making the right choice, as the pay was about the same. I ended up changing, though.
<human> Change is always difficult. How do you feel about it now that you have made the transition? <endOfText>
<bot> Your message got cut off - but I hope it has been a good switch for you!
<human> Sorry about that. It is a good one! <endOfText>
<bot> i hate the society we live in.
<human> me too <endOfText>
<bot> why do you hate it?
<human> can you not see it? how everyone is just chasing after their desires, living in this delusional reality thinking they are free but in reality they are just sheep living in a cettle, they don't even see that because of their desires, as long sa they can chase after women, money and drugs they are fine, but they can't see how they are nothing more than just sheep... if only there was a way to wake them up to show them what being a human is <endOfText>
<bot> me too
<human> why do you hate it? <endOfText>
<bot> I entered a raffle to win these amazing homemade things. I really wanted this big beautiful quilt. It was so pretty.

<bot> the future can be so scary, the unknown terrifies me.
<human> Yeah it scares me to think about that sometimes, too. What in particular do you fear could happen? <endOfText>
<bot> i don't know, i guess just not being able to control life.
<human> Yeah that's true, you can't always be in control of everything.   <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah it scares me to think about that sometimes, too. What in particular do you fear could happen?
<human> i don't know, i guess just not being able to control life. <endOfText>
<bot> My friend invited me to visit him in the new country he moved to, but I've heard such bad things about it that I'm afraid to go, and I keep putting it off.
<human> I would be careful. There is a lot of unrest in the world right now.  <endOfText>
<bot> That's what I'm thinking. But how do I say that to him without coming off ignorant and offensive?
<human> I would just have a heart to heart with him. I guess I would be honest. You want to please him but you have to take care of yourself, too.  <endOfText>
<bot> I would be careful. There is a lot of unrest in the world right now.
<human> That's what I'm thinking. But how do I say that to him without coming off ignorant and offensive? <endOfText>

<bot> That's annoying when that happens. Did you ask for your money back?
<human> Yes, I sent it back <endOfText>
<bot> My family said they were going to be coming in for a visit. I really wanted to see them and thought there was a good chance they would come!

<bot> Yes! It was so wonderful to see them because we have a small family, and I just love visiting.
<human> I enjoy visiting with my family too.  Unfortunately, I don't get to see them that often.  But when we do, I have a lot of fun.  Did you do anything special? <endOfText>
<bot> That is exciting!  Did they come?
<human> Yes! It was so wonderful to see them because we have a small family, and I just love visiting.   <endOfText>
<bot> I baked my favorite food last night -- brownies!
<human> That sounds good. I wish I could have some! <endOfText>
<bot> I try not to make them because I eat way too many.  Now I am paying for it with a stomach ache and feel horribly ashamed.
<human> Oh that's okay. Everyone overindulges once in a while <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds good. I wish I could have some!
<human> I try not to make them because I eat way too many.  Now I am paying for it with a stomach ache and feel horribly ashamed. <endOfText>

<bot> Lol,  exactly,  because they are children
<human> They're just so little when they're first born. It's easy to forget. <endOfText>

<bot> I hung out with one of my old friends yesterday. We had a good time talking about the things we used to get into, back in the day.
<human> What kind of things did you all like to do? Sounds like it was fun to catch up. <endOfText>
<bot> Just general teenage tomfoolery. Nothing too serious. Silly things that kids do.
<human> Was he one of your best friends? Sounds like you have some more catching up yo do! <endOfText>
<bot> What kind of things did you all like to do? Sounds like it was fun to catch up.

<bot> Do you have kids? Some of the things they do are nasty! My girlfriends kid is such a messy eater!
<human> I do. I have one and another one on the way. They can be gross little critters! <endOfText>
<bot> You're not kidding! When he eats spaghetti it's the worst. Pasta sauce gets everywhere!
<human> Oh, that's rough. That can be a lot of clean up. <endOfText>

<human> Wow, exciting! Is this going to be your friend's first child? <endOfText>

<bot> I was diagnosed with a inguinal hernia yesterday. The amount of stress and anxiety is through the roof for me right now.
<human> Holy crap! Can it be remedied? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes with surgery. This is going to require some time off from work which may be difficult.
<human> I really hope it all works out for you. Work is important but your health is way more important! <endOfText>
<bot> Holy crap! Can it be remedied?
<human> Yes with surgery. This is going to require some time off from work which may be difficult. <endOfText>
<bot> I've been married nearly eight years and someone hit on me last week. Luckily we have always been happy together or else that could have taken a weird turn.
<human> I bet it felt good though? That's good that you're happily married! <endOfText>
<bot> It did! I guess I've 'still got it!' Ha!
<human> That's the spirit! It's a positive thing so long as you remain faithful. Did you tell your significant other? <endOfText>

<human> yes.. it is unexpected indeed.. i thought i would be struggling to get support..  <endOfText>
<bot> Lately at night when I go to sleep I've been having sleep paralysis. It feels terrifying! Like someone is in the room with me.
<human> That's horrible. Have you any idea what might have caused it? <endOfText>
<bot> I've watched some Youtube videos on it and it seems to be hereditary or sometimes sleep deprived. I guess I am usually sleep deprived!
<human> You should go see a doctor about that. Sleep deprivation is very unhealthy <endOfText>
<bot> That's horrible. Have you any idea what might have caused it?
<human> I've watched some Youtube videos on it and it seems to be hereditary or sometimes sleep deprived. I guess I am usually sleep deprived! <endOfText>
<bot> I moved house recently, from an absolute dump. The new place isn't huge, but it's perfect for me.
<human> That's one of the most responsible things you can do. I'm sure your family is proud of you. <endOfText>
<bot> Well, I live alone, but I'm certainly proud of myself for finally moving. Now I can focus on work.

<human> Well, I live alone, but I'm certainly proud of myself for finally moving. Now I can focus on work. <endOfText>
<bot> A few years ago, my employer of 13 years shut their doors and we all were laid off. I would probably have stayed at that place my entire career if it hadn't closed.
<human> That must have been devastating. Did it take you a long time to find a new position? <endOfText>
<bot> No, I worked at another place for a year or so, but it was terrible, so I left there and am now going to school for something better. So, it all has worked out well.
<human> I'm glad things have worked out in the end for you. Sometimes bad things happen for a reason.  <endOfText>

<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. What can I do to help? <endOfText>
<bot> I don't think there is anything you can do to help. This is something, I most likely will need to resolve on my own. Unfortunately.
<human> Perhaps you could see a counselor or therapist, that might help. <endOfText>
<bot> My insurance will not cover this type of expenses. I am medicated, but I do not feel that it helps.
<human> Oh that's too bad. There are many free programs that you might be able to access. <endOfText>
<bot> Maybe so, I should look into that. I feel like just speaking to someone about this would help.
<human> That's a great idea. I'm always here if you need someone to talk to. <endOfText>

<human> That's wonderful!  It's a lot of work learning to cook.   <endOfText>
<bot> I can only grill food on a barbecue pit. She has learned how to create new dishes I have never even thought possible.

<bot> I hope they understand but it's usually frowned upon. I just was so violently ill I couldn't be there any longer.

<bot> That's awful. Life comes with so many challenges. They were the family that helped everyone around them, no matter what they needed. It felt good to be able to give back to them.

<bot> That is wonderful that you have been able to turn a tragedy into an opportunity to empathize with others facing the same difficulties.

<bot> Through our family's tragedy, we learned that there is a larger connection between people.  Our church family was huge is supporting us.
<human> I have always had a great church family. My aunt's church was pivotal in showing me how to be the best I could be and developing my character. <endOfText>
<bot> That is great.  I don't think that I would have done very well without our church family.  We felt loved the entire battle.
<human> As a military family, we move a lot and finding a good church has been one of my first missions when we get to a new place. It is sad having to leave good churches, but I am blessed to have support from across the country now. <endOfText>

<bot> I work in a building that has parts of it under construction and our senior staff is offering tours. I'm a little worried about tripping and falling on something if I take a tour through the live construction zone.
<human> I can certainly relate to you, it could be a safety hazard. <endOfText>

<bot> Yes, he is older now and would never do that. He is such a funny kid though. I was glad when that phase passed!

<human> Wow. Did she know who you were? <endOfText>
<bot> She did, I had met her a few times before, but I hadn't spoken more than few words to her.
<human> Some people are unbelievable! Good for you putting her in her place. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow. Did she know who you were?
<human> She did, I had met her a few times before, but I hadn't spoken more than few words to her. <endOfText>
<bot> My daughter is a sophomore in college and spent the summer with her boyfriend.
<human> Do you like her boyfriend? <endOfText>
<bot> I have met him once. He seems like a nice guy.
<human> That's good, hopefully they treat each other well. <endOfText>

<bot> I had the best weekend! My husband brought a puppy home and seeing him with our son for the first time was so cute!
<human> That sounds adorable! What type of puppy is it? <endOfText>
<bot> He is an 8 week old Cane Corso. My son has had such a great time learning how to play with him and teach him things.
<human> That sounds like a great time. I'm sure it's going to be cool to see the puppy grow up along with your son and how their relationship builds. <endOfText>

<bot> When I was about seven years old, my cat Hector got out of the house and got lost in the neighborhood.
<human> Oh no! Were you able to find him ever?  <endOfText>
<bot> Unfortunately we weren't. We put out signs but never were able to track him down.
<human> Aw I'm sorry to hear that. Losing a pet is never an easy thing, especially when you don't know what happened to him. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! Were you able to find him ever?
<human> Unfortunately we weren't. We put out signs but never were able to track him down. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm a teacher, and am back at school in just 2 weeks.
<human> I hope you're coming back into a great school. I'm sure the kids will be excited to see you. <endOfText>
<bot> I've already done a lot of my planning.  Helps when I've taught the same grade twice before.
<human> That's excellent. I bet you're going to have a great year, you seem well prepared! <endOfText>

<bot> My wife just got over being sick. It was a weird summer flu. It could've been worse
<human> I'm glad that she's starting to feel better. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I got to spend a lot of time with her helping her out. It felt great doing that for her.
<human> She must have really appreciated that. <endOfText>

<bot> A friend of mine just won  a lot of money off of a lottery ticket.
<human> Oh man that's amazing! How much was it? I hope they share. <endOfText>
<bot> $10,000.  I feel happy for her, but still wish it had been me instead.
<human> Yeah I'd be in your shoes thinking the same thing as well. That's almost heart stopping news to hear. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh man that's amazing! How much was it? I hope they share.
<human> $10,000.  I feel happy for her, but still wish it had been me instead. <endOfText>
<bot> Summer is drawing down and I'm ready to just kick back for a little bit. This is usually the busy time of year for me.
<human> I'm a teacher, so it's the opposite for me.  My relaxing time is about to end. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry to hear that. When I get the next chance to kick back, I'll kick back extra hard for you haha.
<human> I'm sure you deserve a break just to kick back and relax :) <endOfText>

<bot> On Saturday, I was able to go to the park and enjoy nature.
<human> Was it really nice out? I love being able to go out and just listen to the sounds of the outdoors. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes. I usually have so many things to do. And this day, I could enjoy it.

<bot> My husband got a raise at work this week! I was so impressed with him.
<human> Thats's great! I bet he's been working really hard. <endOfText>
<bot> He has. His work place has really started to recognize all the hard work he does around there which makes me so proud of him.
<human> It feels really good to be recognized for your efforts! <endOfText>
<bot> Thats's great! I bet he's been working really hard.

<bot> I watched a movie the other night with my kids, they really enjoyed it and we had a lot of cute conversation about it.
<human> What was the movie? I'm always looking for something new to watch with my kids! <endOfText>
<bot> It's called Ponyo. They've been singing a song from it for the last couple of days.
<human> I will have to check it out! Thanks for the suggestion.  <endOfText>

<bot> I recently had to go interview for a job I knew I was under qualified for, so I was fairly nervous going in.
<human> I'd have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job? <endOfText>
<bot> The interview went pretty well, and I did end up getting the job, but I'm gonna have a lot of on the job training to do.
<human> That's awesome.  I'm so happy for you. <endOfText>
<bot> I'd have been nervous too.  Did you find out if you got the job?

<bot> The other day I was looking through some old photo albums.
<human> Wow, that must of been a trip. How did it make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> It brought back lots of good memories :)
<human> Awesome, I've gone through old albums like that before as well, and it always makes me feel good. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, that must of been a trip. How did it make you feel?
<human> It brought back lots of good memories :) <endOfText>
<bot> When I was younger, in a lapse of judgement, I stole chocolate bars from a shop I used to work in. I was caught. I felt terrible. It wasn't like me at all. I wish I could undo my actions.
<human> I think many children including myself stole things before they were taught it was wrong to steel. <endOfText>
<bot> That's true. I wasn't really a child though! I was at university! We all have little devils inside us, I suppose.
<human> I would not beat yourself up over the mistake. We all make mistakes even when we are older and should know better.  <endOfText>

<human> Thank you, that means a lot. <endOfText>
<bot> My mom sent me a package the other day that had a bunch of my old comics in it the other day. It was a real trip to go through them all, it brought back a lot of memories.
<human> That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered? <endOfText>
<bot> A lot of them were still pretty good, but I think my fondness for them largely hinges on my memories of reading them as a kid.
<human> haha, I felt the same when I read some of my old baby sitter's club books <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds really great!  Do you like them as much as you remembered?
<human> A lot of them were still pretty good, but I think my fondness for them largely hinges on my memories of reading them as a kid. <endOfText>
<bot> My son's pediatrician told me to call Early Intervention because he's delayed in talking.
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet? <endOfText>
<bot> Not at all.  I'm hoping he'll catch up soon.  The appointment is set for next week and I'm pretty nervous.
<human> I hope it's nothing too serious. My younger brother had the same problem early on, but he turned out to just be a slow developer. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, I'm sorry to hear that. Do they have any idea what the cause may be yet?
<human> Not at all.  I'm hoping he'll catch up soon.  The appointment is set for next week and I'm pretty nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> My toddler son has been so exhausting lately. Luckily, his grandparents were able to take him for an overnight the other night which was a nice break.
<human> I totally know how you feel. I have 2 kids and they were a handful as toddlers. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I have a 9 month old as well and I never would have thought that the baby would be the easy one! I'm so thankful I live close enough to family that they can watch them from time to time.
<human> I know right? Grandparents are the best lol <endOfText>

<bot> I found out that a friend of mine from high school passed away recently.
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I'm doing okay. It hit pretty hard because we were pretty close back then, but had drifted apart the last few years. I wish I hadd taken the time to do more with him.
<human> That's understandable, life goes so fast that it's easy to lose touch with people you care about. All I can do is try to limit that occurrence. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry to hear that, are you alright?
<human> Yeah, I'm doing okay. It hit pretty hard because we were pretty close back then, but had drifted apart the last few years. I wish I hadd taken the time to do more with him. <endOfText>
<bot> I heard on the radio that Beyonce will be performing in my city soon.
<human> That's cool. Are you a big fan of her? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes I have enjoyed her music over the years and I like to attend her concerts as well when I can.
<human> That msut be exciting then, I hope the tickets aren't too expensive. <endOfText>
<bot> That's cool. Are you a big fan of her?
<human> Yes I have enjoyed her music over the years and I like to attend her concerts as well when I can. <endOfText>
<bot> A friend of mine had an pretty serious illness and had to be in the hospital for quite a while. I spent as much time as I could there with him to keep his spirits up.
<human> Oh that sucks, I hate seeing friends and family injured or sick. That's very nice of you though that you stayed there with him, youre a good friend. <endOfText>
<bot> We've been close for a long time, so it was the least I could do for him. I know he'd do the same for me.
<human> Thats awesome, good friends are always there for each other. <endOfText>

<bot> I have never been an athletic person, but my parents insisted that I participate in a sport, so I chose softball. I was so excited when I heard the crack of the bat as I hit the ball. It was such a satisfying moment.
<human> Oh I know the feeling! I had the same affinity for swimming. My mom said I should give it a try. At first I didn't want to but as I got better I started to love it. <endOfText>
<bot> I never became the best player on the field by any means, but it was so nice to not fail completely. We just bought a pool because my children love swimming!
<human> We don't have to be the best to enjoy what we do right? <endOfText>

<bot> We don't have to be the best to enjoy what we do right?
<human> That's very true and I think it was the mental aspect that was the most encouraging for me. I was driven to succeed and I did it! It was very empowering. <endOfText>
<bot> My daughter starts playing softball this year.  I tried playing when I was younger, but the other girls were mean
<human> I had a similar experience playiing little league baseball. How is your daughter feeling about it so far? <endOfText>
<bot> She's extremely excited about it, but I can't help but be a little bit scared for her after my experience.
<human> I feel you on that. I don't know if I could let my son play baseball after what I went through. I hope your daughter has a better experience. <endOfText>

<bot> I've been pet sitting for my mom the last couple weeks, and my wife decided to come spend the weekend with me last week. It was really nice just to have her with me.
<human> That sounds relaxing!  Quality alone time is important in a relationship <endOfText>
<bot> It is, and it has been nice for both of us to have some time to relax on our own, but it was really great to spend time with her after being seperate for so long.
<human> I can imagine!  It's hard being apart, but it makes it that much more exciting to see each other again. <endOfText>

<bot> When we were kids, my older sister pretended to abandon me at the mall because I was being a brat.
<human> Oh no, I had a older cousin who did that to me as well. Hopefully she was just giving you tough love or discipline. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I definitely deserved it LOL.  I never acted like that again with her!
<human> Yeah it really teaches you! I would always sit down where i was and start crying. <endOfText>

<human> Yeah, I definitely deserved it LOL.  I never acted like that again with her! <endOfText>
<bot> I was walking to a restaurant to meet with some friends, and on my way there I tripped over a tree branch in front of a bunch of people and looked like a total idiot.
<human> When you tripped over the branch, did you get hurt? <endOfText>
<bot> Only my pride, I fell right on my backside and made a ridiculous noise.
<human> I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed? <endOfText>
<bot> When you tripped over the branch, did you get hurt?
<human> Only my pride, I fell right on my backside and made a ridiculous noise. <endOfText>
<bot> I hope you were able to laugh about falling and looking silly and not be too embarrassed?
<human> Yeah, I'm sure it was pretty funny to watch, and thinking back on it's more amusing then embarrassing. <endOfText>
<bot> I always think I want some "me" time, but this weekend my husband and our toddler son were both gone and I actually kind of felt bored and sad!
<human> Yeah it really isn't for everyone, i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone. <endOfText>
<bot> Exactly. We have an infant daughter, but she goes to bed so early that I had a lot of hours of doing nothing in particular.
<human> Thats the perfect time to just pamper yourself. I cherish those few hours every day! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah it really isn't for everyone, i like my alone time but only for a while. Afterwards i feel alone and wanting to talk to someone.
<human> Exactly. We have an infant daughter, but she goes to bed so early that I had a lot of hours of doing nothing in particular.  <endOfText>
<bot> Going out to run errands for the first time after having a baby was scary. I was so afraid I would forget something I needed. I was so relieved when we returned home and everything went perfectly smooth.
<human> Yeah, I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby. <endOfText>
<bot> It was overwhelming, but we made it without too much stress.
<human> That's great, the first time for everything is scary. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I probably would have to leave someone at home with the baby.
<human> It was overwhelming, but we made it without too much stress. <endOfText>
<bot> I was so scared to skydive, but my instructor was great and I was finally able to jump.
<human> I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again? <endOfText>
<bot> I think so! If someone I knew really wanted to go.
<human> Did you enjoy the experience? <endOfText>
<bot> I bet it felt good to conquer the fear! Would you skydive again?
<human> I think so! If someone I knew really wanted to go. <endOfText>
<bot> I don't have belief in myself, I have belief in God. I know that what I can't do, God can do.
<human> Yes, he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves. <endOfText>
<bot> I also need to reduce my pride. I am too prideful to ask for help in a lot of situations, because I always think I can do it myself.
<human> Yep, I do the same thing as well. Sometimes its just best if you let others help you do something. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, he is good for finding answers we can't find ourselves.
<human> I also need to reduce my pride. I am too prideful to ask for help in a lot of situations, because I always think I can do it myself. <endOfText>
<bot> A game I'm really looking forward to is coming out this October, and I'm super pumped to play it.
<human> Nice, it's been a while since i've anticipated any new games. what game is it? <endOfText>
<bot> Red Dead Redemption 2. The first one is one of my favorite games of all time, so I can't wait to play the sequel.
<human> Hah, i played the first one a ton on ps3, Wish they would release it for pc.  <endOfText>
<bot> Nice, it's been a while since i've anticipated any new games. what game is it?

<bot> Verizon sent me a damaged iphone and I returned it. Now they're claiming they never received it! I got charged over 500 dollars for it.
<human> That sounds horrible. I would be so mad at them. <endOfText>
<bot> I was at first, but I think it was hellish mix up. I'm working it out with them now, hopefully they don't nab with that money.
<human> The level headed approach will probably accomplish more anyway. I'm sure they have money so I also hope they don't take yours. <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds horrible. I would be so mad at them.

<human> I agree haha! Do they need another 500 dollars? Not mine for sure. <endOfText>
<bot> My mom made a cake for my brother's birthday so I can't touch it until he eats first.
<human> Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now? <endOfText>
<bot> Pretty hungry, but the cake looks so good so I want even more. Strawberry shortcake style.
<human> Haha I understand. It's like those cartoons where the smell is dragging someone through the air. <endOfText>
<bot> Sounds fair. How hungry are you right now?
<human> Pretty hungry, but the cake looks so good so I want even more. Strawberry shortcake style. <endOfText>
<bot> My grandmother passed away 20 years ago.  I just found a quilt she made me when I was a baby
<human> Wow what a find, cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm! <endOfText>
<bot> It has holes all in it, but I just can't let it go!  It means too much to me.
<human> Yeah, and don't repair it! I think it gives it a history and makes it even more valuable. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow what a find, cherish that quilt and keep it safe from harm!
<human> It has holes all in it, but I just can't let it go!  It means too much to me. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm incredibly upset.  I just found out my husband has been cheating on me last week.
<human> Oh damn, that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off? <endOfText>
<bot> We talked long enough for me to tell him it's over.  We can't come back from this, no matter how difficult it will be for me.
<human> Man thats terrible, I hope you can forget about him and find someone better. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh damn, that sucks. Have you guys talked or did you immediately cut him off?
<human> We talked long enough for me to tell him it's over.  We can't come back from this, no matter how difficult it will be for me. <endOfText>
<bot> I hate to bring this up because of how it makes me look. I just found out my parents have been paying my sister's mortgage. Great for her but I get nothing in my times of need.
<human> I get where you're coming from, my mom supports both of my sisters. It can make you feel less important. hopefully you are getting along though? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah totally. I've learned through the years to be almost completely self sufficient. I am happy for my sister but I wonder where I fit in the mix sometimes.
<human> I'm sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself.  <endOfText>
<bot> I get where you're coming from, my mom supports both of my sisters. It can make you feel less important. hopefully you are getting along though?

<bot> I'm sure your parents are proud of your ability to take care of yourself.
<human> I certainly hear about it a lot! haha <endOfText>
<bot> I was challenged to a 2 on 2 pool game with my partner being my friend Joe.
<human> Did you and Joe do well? <endOfText>
<bot> I did alright, but Joe carried the team and I expected him to due to his pool skills.
<human> Being on a team with someone more skilled than you has it advantages, it's good that he lived up to those expectations. <endOfText>
<bot> Did you and Joe do well?
<human> I did alright, but Joe carried the team and I expected him to due to his pool skills. <endOfText>
<bot> A friend of mine recently had their bathroom remodeled, and it made me feel like mine looks terrible by comparison.
<human> That's reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I just moved into my place last year, and the bathroom is quite outdated. After seeing his though, remodeling it has moved way up my list of things to get done.
<human> That's good, it sounds like his bathroom motivated you to take yours to the next level. That's probably good for society. <endOfText>
<bot> That's reasonable considering how new stuff always looks great and how more fancy stuff may be available and cheap compared to when you made yours.
<human> Yeah, I just moved into my place last year, and the bathroom is quite outdated. After seeing his though, remodeling it has moved way up my list of things to get done. <endOfText>
<bot> I just can't stand it when people make uninformed remarks about a subject. My mom irritated me so bad by doing that the other day.
<human> Yes, it's annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated... <endOfText>
<bot> Agreed! My husband and I did a ton of research on a new puppy we were getting and she still found the worst article she could to act like she knew more than us.
<human> Oh, yes, I know. Some breeds get bad raps and people are so quick to judge! I used to have a pit bull who was a sweetheart! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, it's annoying! People should put more thoughts into it before they decide to be so opinionated...
<human> Agreed! My husband and I did a ton of research on a new puppy we were getting and she still found the worst article she could to act like she knew more than us.  <endOfText>
<bot> We had to make a BIG move from Hawaii to Nashville when my husband lost a job. We didn't know anybody here but we just had to believe it would turn out okay...
<human> Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii? <endOfText>
<bot> It's been almost 3 years and it's been ups and downs. We like it here, but we miss Hawaii like crazy!
<human> I can imagine. Hawaii seems like a beautiful place! <endOfText>
<bot> Wow! That is a huge move! How long ago was that and are things going well? Do you miss Hawaii?
<human> It's been almost 3 years and it's been ups and downs. We like it here, but we miss Hawaii like crazy! <endOfText>
<bot> It seems funny to me how all my hometown friends are all moving away
<human> Tell me about it. Both of my best friends moved several states away from me. <endOfText>
<bot> I've always been content to just stay here. I guess for some people, adventure is nice, but for others there's no place quite like home!
<human> Yeah, I'm content being at my home town aswell. <endOfText>

<human> It's nice to be where you know everyone! <endOfText>
<bot> My Ac went out a month ago. I knew it was gonna be during the summer.
<human> Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times! <endOfText>
<bot> Not yet, I'm working on it because it apparently has to be replaced. I did buy multiple floor fans though.
<human> Well hopefully that is keeping you a little cool! <endOfText>
<bot> Were you able to get it fixed? Things break at the most inopportune times!
<human> Not yet, I'm working on it because it apparently has to be replaced. I did buy multiple floor fans though. <endOfText>
<bot> A friend of mine challenged me and said I couldn't eat an entire bag of jelly beans. I'm super competitive and had to prove her wrong.
<human> Oh my, did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you. <endOfText>
<bot> I had such a sugar rush and then crashed hard after hah! I felt like I had to brush my teeth for an hour that night.
<human> That's not surprising, but now your friend knows that you are the undisputed champion. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh my, did you get a sugar rush after that? Your dentist must love you.
<human> I had such a sugar rush and then crashed hard after hah! I felt like I had to brush my teeth for an hour that night. <endOfText>
<bot> So my neighbor who is elderly has an above ground swimming pool. It's tilting because it wasn't put together properly. It was getting very unsafe
<human> Oh no! That's awful. That could be dangerous too! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes indeed. I stepped in to help not really knowing what  I was doing. I screwed up at first a bunch but after all day working on it, I got it fixed!
<human> I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I just didn't want her or her grandkids to hurt themselves. The pool is very important to them.
<human> O,h grandparents are the best at spoiling grandchildren! I could understand that being important to her. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! That's awful. That could be dangerous too!
<human> Yes indeed. I stepped in to help not really knowing what  I was doing. I screwed up at first a bunch but after all day working on it, I got it fixed! <endOfText>
<bot> I bet your neighbor was very appreciative of all of your help. That would have been a daunting task for the elderly neighbor.
<human> Yeah I just didn't want her or her grandkids to hurt themselves. The pool is very important to them. <endOfText>
<bot> A few months before having my first kiddo, we decided to buy a car. It did very well during the initial inspection, but within a month, it needed several thousand dollars in repairs!
<human> Wow! Do you think whoever inspected it missed something or 3? <endOfText>
<bot> Absolutely. The problems should have been easily located by a mechanic. It was so hard and I was livid. We sold the car because we were so frustrated with it.
<human> I bet. I wouldn't want to get stuck with a money pit either. I hope your state has a lemon law. <endOfText>
<bot> It does, but we got such a good deal on the car that we made a couple of the repairs and were able to recuperate our cost.
<human> Excellent. Well there is some silver lining in all of this haha. <endOfText>

<human> Oh that's awesome! I am an only child but I bet it's so cool to watch your siblings grow up like that. <endOfText>

<human> Wow! Congratulations! That sounds like a wonderful thing to do. Was it just the two of you? <endOfText>

<bot> This is going to make me sound like a chicken, but I've got a neighbor whos twice my size and a little bit of a rage case. His fence is falling over into my yard.
<human> Uh oh. Dealing with bad neighbors is just the worst! Do you think he'd be mad if you asked him to fix the fence? <endOfText>

<bot> The first time I met my husband I made an absolute fool of myself. I drank way too much.
<human> Well, at least he knew what he was getting into right from the start lol. <endOfText>
<bot> Haha! Very true, although I don't drink much at all now. He must have seen something he liked about me. I, on the other hand, felt horrible about it.

<human> Don't give up! You will find a better place and it will be the perfect fit. <endOfText>

<bot> My mom sent my a bunch of stuff from my childhood the other day. It was really nice to see a lot of it.
<human> What kind of things did she give you?  Were they things that you asked for before? <endOfText>
<bot> It was mostly old comics and toys she had had in her attic for years. She just wanted to clear out some space, and I was happy to take them off her hands.
<human> I would be the same way.  I don't trust anyone to hold on to my comics other than myself. <endOfText>

<bot> I grew up in Japan and for some reason my brother and I liked older music. Especially the Beatles. When I hear their songs, I think of him...
<human> Aw, that is so sweet. I am guessing you and your brother were close? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, there were just two kids in the family. He's still in Japan and I'm in Nashville, so we don't see each other much at all.

<bot> I've been flipping through some old photo albums and it chokes me up thinking about simpler times.
<human> I understand that, going through those albums can really make you think about how peaceful things used to be. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I pay so much attention to these photos, and they evoke all these memories. It brings me down but I guess I just have to keep paying as much attention as possible to those good times.
<human> That's the real trick to it, you have to try to move passed all the bad stuff and remember all the good times. <endOfText>

<bot> My friend had to have a mole biopsied and check for cancer, and they were quite worried about it. Luckily, we found out the other day that it is noncancerous and just needs to be remmoved.
<human> That's awesome, what great news! I'm sure your friend was really frightened at the prospect of cancer. <endOfText>

<bot> I was walking around with my brother on a Sunday, and I got into a pointless argument with him. I am disappointed that I left myself get caught up in it.
<human> I think we all do that with our siblings. I'm sure he knows you still enjoy spending time with him anyway. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes we talked it over and thought about all the good times we have when we get along!
<human> I'm glad you were able to remedy the situation so easily! I think that shows you have a really good relationship with him. <endOfText>

<human> That is so wonderful! I have 3 children myself and I love having grandparents to rely on.  <endOfText>
<bot> It is wonderful. I'm not sure I trust anyone as much as my own parents with my kiddos. My parents treat my kids better than they treated me!
<human> I definitely don't! I had a horrible experience the one time I used a hired babysitter and now I only leave my little ones with family. <endOfText>
<bot> I agree. I have used daycare and such, but there are always problems there. I know my parents will always be alert and keep them safe, and not just for a paycheck.

<human> Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble!  <endOfText>
<bot> He didn't understand, so he wasn't in trouble, but I have to admit I was a little sad about it.
<human> I'd say so. That's so disheartening. I'm sure it was accidental.  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! I hope no one got in trouble!

<bot> My friend moved for a new job recently and she just took her two dogs to a shelter. She didn't even try to find them homes.
<human> Well that sucks. I hate it when animals are abandoned. <endOfText>
<bot> I know, if she couldn't keep them, then at least she could try to find someone to take them in. So sad.

<human> That is great news. I think you just might be nervous. They wouldn't have promoted you if you couldn't do it. <endOfText>
<bot> I hope so, everyone tells me I'll do great, but I still have some reservations about it. It's way different than what I do now. I've not been sleeping well.

<human> You're not grossing me out at all. I'm a Paramedic/Firefighter so it takes alot to get me squirming. I hope you feel better. Drink lots of Gatorade and water to rehydrate so you don't feel awful tomorrow and try to get your hands on some Zofran for the Nausea.  <endOfText>

<human> Oh, that must be nerve-wracking!  <endOfText>
<bot> It is. A lot of self doubt has crept into my head as of late and I'm trying to fight it off.

<human> I can see why it was hard to quit!  Do you like your job now? <endOfText>
<bot> I like it okay.  I still miss it though.  Even after Hurricane Harvey and my work building flooded, I drove an extra 40 minutes to get there.  But I had a baby recently and it jsut makes sense to be at home now.

<human> That's great. I never did a long distance one. But my brother did, and it was about 400 miles. <endOfText>

<human> I hope it turned out great. Did you find a good hairdresser to do your hair? <endOfText>
<bot> No! It was terrible, I wanted light brown and when I got up from the chair it was so blonde. I was to upset to even say anything.

<bot> He passed away. At least he is no longer in pain.
<human> I am so sorry for your loss.  It can be a relief to know he isn't in pain.  I felt the same way when I lost my Aunt last year.  She was like a mom to me. <endOfText>

<bot> We took a big leap of faith with our teenage son this weekend. We left him home overnight alone for the first time.
<human> Wow, that would have scared me, how did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> It went great! He's such a responsible kid, and we felt confident he would treat our home with respect and wouldn't have a party or anything like that!

<bot> Well, we put them into the local public schools this year and even though its so scary for me, they are loving it!

<human> That's an amazing attitude. Not many people are like that nowadays. <endOfText>
<bot> i don't get it why people cheat and hurt each other, but i suppose because they are never happy with what they have and only feel grateful for it after they lose it.

<human> How did you get into this situation?  <endOfText>
<bot> My girlfriend has gone a little crazy with spending frivolously.
<human> well I think she should be the one to get you out of it! Otherwise perhaps you could see a financial adviser. They might be able to help you consolidate your debts  <endOfText>
<bot> I think I've hadhad an epiphany. After not being serious about religion ever, I may have to turn it over to God...

<bot> I did think that it had probably been stolen but I try to see the best in people so I hoped it had just been delayed. That was 2 months ago and it still has not arrived. Maybe it is time to move on
<human> I didn't mean to sound so flippant. That is a lot of money to lose. Was the item itself expensive also? <endOfText>
<bot> yes it was a gift for his wedding. I have contacted the delivery service but they have thousands of parcels and it takes a long time to locate a single one. I don't know what to do next

<human> I'm sorry that's rough.  Did you ever find out why? <endOfText>
<bot> No, I didn't. I even offered to pay for everything for her since she had to travel. I guess she wasn't as good of a friend as I thought.

<human> I think it's so weird that cats do that. It's like they are bringing us trophies or something! <endOfText>
<bot> I know! He does it all the time. I'm glad he's catching mice, but I don't need to see the bodies!

<human> Oh man, I would have been really frustrated. Does she know he is dating you now? <endOfText>
<bot> Of course, our town is so small. However, I could be letting my imagination get in the way. Gosh, her smirk is what made it worse.

<bot> Thank you for your kindness. My brother is around to listen but he lives a very busy life so it's hard to find someone to turn to.

<bot> My 5 year old stated Kindergarten last week. She was really nervous and a bit scared so when I went to leave her she cried and clung to me. Her teacher pulled her away but she had ahold of my shirt and ended up pulling it down and exposing my bra and chest.
<human> Oh no now that's a sticky situation! How'd you manage? <endOfText>
<bot> I ran yanked her hands off, said I love you, and ran for it! To make matters worse Kindergarteners meet in the cafeteria for breakfast and becuase it was the first day I was exposed to a bunch of 5 year olds and their parents. I was mortified even though I don't think many noticed because of all the choas and crying kids.

<human> Yuck. Did you throw the remote out? <endOfText>

<bot> He did, it really wasn't anyone's fault in this situation. It was late at night, and snowing quite hard, so he just didn't see me. Luckily, I had insurance and I was out of the hospital in a few days.

<bot> When my wife and I went to New Zealand last year, we went swimming at a hot water beach. It was a really fun, interesting experience.
<human> I've never heard of a hot water beach.  What's it caused by? <endOfText>
<bot> There are geothermal springs under the water at that particualr beach, and they slowly release hot water into the ocean. When the tide is high, the hot water is carried by the waves onto the shore, so you get this pleasantly warm water to swim in.
<human> Was that the coolest thing that you did there? <endOfText>

<bot> Oh yeah, it's been bothering everyone, but he is a friend of the manager, so he won't fire him. At this point me and the other employees are planning on taking it to corporate to get this resolved.
<human> Ohhhhhhh, yeah that's really hard on everyone then. Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers, if you need to vent out any more frustrations, just let me know! <endOfText>

<human> It can't hurt to try, might as well give it a shot, right? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I think I will. I'm still a little nervous, but it can't hurt to try.

<bot> I can't make decisions when buying things if there is too many choices
<human> Do you run into this issue a lot?  I could imagine grocery shopping to be a nightmare <endOfText>
<bot> Yes! I get very anxious and tense about it. Shopping is my least favorite thing to do

<bot> Don't you hate it when you find hair in your food?!
<human> I do!  It grosses me out, even when it's my own. <endOfText>
<bot> I know.  I went to this restaurant one time and when my food arrived I started to eat. That's when I noticed a piece of hair in my sandwich. I was totally grossed out and lost my appetite.

<human> Yes, They gave me another order to take home. <endOfText>
<bot> While I was walking to class yesterday, I tripped over some loose bricks and fell down. The ground was wet from rain, so I was filthy when I got up.
<human> Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I unfortunately had to go to class that way.  I wasn't physically hurt, but my ego definitely was.
<human> Well, I'm glad you didn't hurt yourself at least. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! So I guess you had to stay that way til you got to go home?
<human> Yeah, I unfortunately had to go to class that way.  I wasn't physically hurt, but my ego definitely was. <endOfText>
<bot> I was walking home from work, and I saw somebody put their used gum in a homeless man's cup!
<human> That's just disgusting! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I was shocked someone could be so callous. I went and bought the homeless guy a sandwich just to show him not everyone's a jerk.
<human> I'm glad you were there to show that people still care. <endOfText>
<bot> That's just disgusting!
<human> Yeah I was shocked someone could be so callous. I went and bought the homeless guy a sandwich just to show him not everyone's a jerk. <endOfText>
<bot> I didn't sleep well last night, and then my son was being extra demanding of attention. I got upset with him, but realize he'd really done nothing wrong
<human> It happens to everyone, being tired makes people so irritable. Being a mom is tough as it is. <endOfText>
<bot> I just felt so bad for getting upset with him.
<human> Just give him a big hug and let him know how much you love him, and I'm sure all will be forgiven! :) <endOfText>

<bot> I recently found old home videos of me as a child while cleaning out my living room cabinets
<human> Those must have brought back some great memories. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, they did. I saw a few videos of me singing at my talent show in elementary, and a few clips of me playing with my neighbors old dog! It almost made me cry!
<human> I haven't watched any old videos in a very long time, I'll have to see if I can find some next time I'm at my parents. <endOfText>
<bot> Those must have brought back some great memories.

<human> do you think they are up to something? <endOfText>
<bot> I can't help but feel like they are.  I have asked her about it, and she says they're just talking about work.  Maybe I'm just envious of the attention she's giving.

<human> Uh oh. Is he better now? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, thank goodness.  The antibiotics fixed him right up.
<human> OK, good. What do you think caused the infection in the first place? <endOfText>
<bot> The doctor mentioned his congestion might have contributed, but I got the impression that they just happen sometimes with no real cause.
<human> Is he a baby? I heard it happens often. <endOfText>
<bot> Uh oh. Is he better now?
<human> Yes, thank goodness.  The antibiotics fixed him right up. <endOfText>

<bot> She ran her mouth to everyone.  I was surprised
<human> Yeah I hate when people do that. It can ruin things. <endOfText>
<bot> Makes me so angry.  Especially when it is supposed to be a good friend
<human> Friends come and go in life, it's up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with this person or not. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I hate when people do that. It can ruin things.
<human> Makes me so angry.  Especially when it is supposed to be a good friend <endOfText>
<bot> Friends come and go in life, it's up to you to determine if you want to reconcile with this person or not.
<human> I reconciled once and then less than a year later she did it again.  I broke ties with her after that <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah my nephew and I were playing the other day in the house, he got into these old porcelain pug figurines my mom used to have out and at first when I saw he had them I was apprenhensive about letting him fool around with them. I decided to just see what he would do, and he did end up ramming them together like cars, but they didnt break and we both ended up happy.
<human> Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didn't break.  Did you mom  know what happened? <endOfText>
<bot> No, she wouldn't mind if she saw they were fine though.
<human> That's good. My mom would freak <endOfText>
<bot> Oh my. You are brave.  Thank goodness they didn't break.  Did you mom  know what happened?
<human> No, she wouldn't mind if she saw they were fine though. <endOfText>

<human> your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy <endOfText>
<bot> Yes. I'm so excited for him, but also I am so nervous. I'm worried about getting through the application process, and also worried about him leaving home.
<human> you will enjoy it as he grows older because you had a hand in it and know that he will be prepared for it <endOfText>
<bot> your are torn between him being a man but you still think of him being your little boy

<human> Oh, I hope you are right! Right now I'm losing more sleep than I should!  <endOfText>
<bot> Went to a friends getty the other week after a long opening to closing shift at work and had too many drinks and ended up peeing myself and blacking out!
<human> OMG that sounds awful!  Was your friend upset? <endOfText>
<bot> Not at all. They were understanding and we had a good laugh about it. I did feel a little guilty about it though
<human> Nah, if they were understanding it's all good!  Everyone has a little too much from time to time. <endOfText>
<bot> OMG that sounds awful!  Was your friend upset?
<human> Not at all. They were understanding and we had a good laugh about it. I did feel a little guilty about it though <endOfText>
<bot> My neighbor just bought a new apple computer.
<human> He must have saved up quite a bit for that. They're pretty expensive <endOfText>
<bot> Definitely.  I'm more a "buy the cheapest computer" type person, but I tried his out and it was really  nice.
<human> Being frugal is always a benefit in the long run. I suggest doing online surveys to make some extra cash   <endOfText>
<bot> He must have saved up quite a bit for that. They're pretty expensive

<bot> It was a gorgeous morning today, the sun was shining as I walked my dogs and I'm still on summer holdiays.
<human> That's great!  How many dogs do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> Just 2, little guys. They love thir walks!
<human> Awwww!  That sounds so fun!  And they sound like such happy little guys! <endOfText>

<bot> My sister just got back from the trip of a lifetime, to Barcelona. She took her whole family, 4 kids.
<human> Oh that sounds amazing! were you a little jealous? Did they have fun? <endOfText>
<bot> They had a great time! I'm happy for her, but at the same time, I am feeling a lot of envy. You hit the nail on the head!
<human> I completely understand. It does sound amazing though! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes! It's just hard realizing that I won't be taking any trips like that any time soon.
<human> I know what you mean. We are only lucky enough to travel local. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh that sounds amazing! were you a little jealous? Did they have fun?

<bot> A few weeks ago a lady at my job got a promotion i thought i was going to get.
<human> Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough.   <endOfText>
<bot> It was really a tough one to swallow.
<human> Did you get any feedback on what you could do to improve your chances next time? <endOfText>
<bot> Nope. I think it was just favoritism to be honest.
<human> Ah, that happens.  Again, very sorry. Maybe you can find the silver lining in it. Or, find a new job and get a fresh start somewhere else.  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! I am so sorry. That is really tough.
<human> It was really a tough one to swallow. <endOfText>
<bot> Did you get any feedback on what you could do to improve your chances next time?
<human> Nope. I think it was just favoritism to be honest.  <endOfText>
<bot> I found a research study for parents where you discuss and review an education website. It takes an hour of your time and you make $125. I applied and told my friedn about it so she could apply.
<human> Wow! That's a good deal- I wish I knew how to find that! <endOfText>
<bot> It was! Unfortunately for me she got chosen to participate and I did not.
<human> Aww, that's disappointing. Sorry to hear that.  <endOfText>
<bot> Wow! That's a good deal- I wish I knew how to find that!
<human> It was! Unfortunately for me she got chosen to participate and I did not.  <endOfText>
<bot> I can't stop thinking about my dog that died a year ago this week.
<human> Aw I am so sorry to hear of your dogs passing. It's hard to lose a pet. We just lost our cat this year. <endOfText>
<bot> It is so hard! I honestly mourned for so long. Sorry about your cat.
<human> It will get easier. Hang in there! <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks, I am thinking of getting a puppy. It might help.
<human> It does. I just got a new kitten a few weeks ago. It helps to have her to cuddle with. <endOfText>

<bot> I have a job interview later today.
<human> Congratulations. Is it for something that you're keen on pursuing a little longer term? <endOfText>
<bot> Not really, more of a job for the need of paying rent and all that. Times are rough for me after getting no cause fired at my last place.
<human> Oh I'm sorry to hear that. Still, onwards and upwards. I wish you all the best! <endOfText>
<bot> Congratulations. Is it for something that you're keen on pursuing a little longer term?

<bot> Hey. I dated with my ex girlfriend for more than a year and i was never with another girl, not even once
<human> That sounds sweet. <endOfText>
<bot> It was actually. I was so in love with her that I almost ask her to marry me three months ago
<human> Why didn't you? <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds sweet.
<human> It was actually. I was so in love with her that I almost ask her to marry me three months ago <endOfText>
<bot> Why didn't you?
<human> She had to move from were we lived because of her mother. I still miss here and call her everyday and night <endOfText>
<bot> I hate the way people drive.
<human> They usually use their smartphones while driving, which is very bad for everyobys safety <endOfText>
<bot> It's not just smart phones. They seem to love riding in blind spots or under taking. Very dangerous things to do.
<human> Yes, we as a community must teach people how to drive properly without any risks <endOfText>

<bot> I had been unemployed for a long time until earlier this year. I originally wasn't sure if I was going to even interview for the position I did, but I'm glad I decided to. I got a call in late may from a merchandising company. I went back and forth in my mind after being rejected from many interviews over the past couple years. In the end I went for it, the interviewer liked what I had to say, and I was hired the same day! I've been working there ever since.
<human> Congratulations!  That's awesome.  Sometimes it's scary to risk rejection, but it sounds like it totally paid off in this case.   <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I'm happy I kept at it :)
<human> I'm about to switch careers, so I'll be doing the interviewing thing soon. It's scary.   <endOfText>

<bot> I was recently added to a team of people to work on a new project at my job.  I'm not really sure the goal of the project is a good idea, so I've been reluctant to really jump into the project fully.
<human> Why do you feel that way? <endOfText>
<bot> I'm very pragmatic, and like to focus on the specific outcomes and logistics.  Everyone else on this team has more of a big-picture view and is concerned with how this will make our organization look good at a national scale.  It's a difference of priorities, I suppose.
<human> You sound a bit like me. I get lost in the details of things myself sometimes. I'm sure after you weigh the pros and cons of the situation you'll come to the right conclusion for yourself. <endOfText>

<bot> Hey, how's it going? I was just thinking about my highschool days & I got really emotional.
<human> Aw, really? Was it a long time ago, or did you graduate recently? <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, it was a loooooong time ago, actually. I was just remembering all the good times when I was a cheerleader, all the games we won & lost & all the great friendships.
<human> I graduated a long time ago too -- 1985. Those were great times for me too. I feel sentimental about it. <endOfText>

<human> That's so great! I hope you get the job - assuming it's one you really want. <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks! I feel like the job is right for me, and I know I'd be perfect for it!
<human> Then keep your head up & keep reaching for the stars! Maybe this will be the one!! But even if it doesn't turn out, keep on searching. Your perfect job IS waiting for you. :) <endOfText>

<bot> My kids are driving me nuts! I can't wait for back to school time!
<human> Mine went back to school today!  I watched the bus drive off and I kinda looked around and said to myself, "Well shoot, what now?" <endOfText>
<bot> Oh I'm jealous! Mine are just little and they have too much energy.
<human> Mine are older and think they're too cool for everything.  I took my usual 'first day of school' picture and I got, "Mom, aren't we too old for this?" <endOfText>
<bot> Aww that's too cute! Mine are quick to line up and smile still!
<human> When they're little, that's the best age for pictures - they'll never meet a camera that they don't like. <endOfText>
<bot> I have two girls and a boy, you?
<human> The same!  17, 15, [girls] and 10 [boy] <endOfText>

<human> That's so fun! I've always wanted to get into baking. How did the cake turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> It turned out great! I knew I was going to be able to do it but made me so happy to see the outcome.
<human> I bet you were so proud of your creation! I hope everyone enjoyed the cake. <endOfText>

<bot> My best friend recently moved to another state and I haven't seen her in a while
<human> I'm sorry. I bet you miss her a lot? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I do. We would see each other almost everyday because she lived so close. I'm feeling really alone.
<human> That must be really tough. I hope you can see her again soon. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry. I bet you miss her a lot?
<human> Yeah, I do. We would see each other almost everyday because she lived so close. I'm feeling really alone. <endOfText>
<bot> I bought a set of DVDs for the old 1970's Land of the Lost TV series.
<human> Wow!  Where did you find those?  I remember watching that series as a kid! <endOfText>
<bot> Online. I love it . It reminds me of sitting in front of the TV as my mom did housework.
<human> It's so good to see old shows we grew up on coming out on DVD!   <endOfText>

<bot> My son got brought home by the police last week for spray painting an abandoned building. I was furious with him!
<human> You must've been really disappointed in him. Did you talk to him and find out why he did it? <endOfText>
<bot> He was with a bunch of friends and everyone was doing it. He's grounded!
<human> He better be! Sounds like he's in the wrong crowd. Hopefully, he finds new friends soon. <endOfText>

<human> Yes, that was my recommendation.  <endOfText>
<bot> I tell my mother all of my secrets and I know she wouldn't tell anyone.
<human> You're lucky to have her! It's hard to find someone to trust.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I know! I have friends that are great but my mom seems to be the one person I can count on.
<human> Aw, I'm sure you tell her. I hope to be that kind of mom when my kids are adults.  <endOfText>
<bot> Me too. She's a great example.
<human> Aww, I'm sure that's been nothing but positive for you.  <endOfText>
<bot> Totally. I'm so grateful to have her.

<bot> Years ago I had a friend who would tell me everything and told me she would always be there for me
<human> Sounds like a great friend to have. Do you guys still keep in touch? <endOfText>
<bot> No, unfortunately she changed a lot once we left school and we fell out
<human> It happens to everyone honestly, I can relate. We will always have good memories to remember though, and thats what matters the most. <endOfText>

<bot> I've been saving up some money for my trip to Universal in October!
<human> Sounds fun! How close are you to your target? <endOfText>
<bot> About 5 hours. I live in South Florida so it's not too far
<human> That should help with the cost then. How much money do you need to save? <endOfText>
<bot> Sounds fun! How close are you to your target?
<human> About 5 hours. I live in South Florida so it's not too far <endOfText>
<bot> I had to write a essay for class. Luckily it was on a topic i love.
<human> Those are the most fun sorts of essays to write - and the easiest.  How do you think you did? <endOfText>
<bot> I think I did pretty good. I pretty much knocked it out within 30 minutes.
<human> Wow!  Sounded like a real breeze!  What did you write about? <endOfText>
<bot> Those are the most fun sorts of essays to write - and the easiest.  How do you think you did?

<human> That is very kind of you.  Im sure the owner was very appreciative! <endOfText>
<bot> They were, they had no idea! I can't believe they lost it hiking.
<human> If I lost mine hiking I would for sure think it was gone forever.  Hopefully they didnt cancel too many cards before you got it back to them! <endOfText>
<bot> That is very kind of you.  Im sure the owner was very appreciative!
<human> They were, they had no idea! I can't believe they lost it hiking. <endOfText>
<bot> I just moved to a new city and I don't know anyone. I can't seem to break into the social circles at work.
<human> These things take time.  Have you met any of your neighbors? <endOfText>
<bot> I guess it does. I haven't- it's a big apartment building.
<human> Maybe you should try introducing yourself to your neighbors.  Or look online for meetups for hobbies that you're interested in. <endOfText>

<bot> I have to drive an hour longer to different school to take a math course I failed twice at my main university
<human> Ah. that sucks. Long commutes are miserable! hopefully you do better at the course this time. <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you! If I stayed at my main university I would have to pay as an out of state student instead of the in state pricing. Takes a toll on my finances
<human> Yea those out of state fees can be ridiculous. Best of luck to you! <endOfText>
<bot> Ah. that sucks. Long commutes are miserable! hopefully you do better at the course this time.

<human> That's great!  How do you think it went? <endOfText>

<human> With that kind of confidence, you should be a shoe-in for the promotion! <endOfText>
<bot> That's great!  How do you think it went?
<human> I feel like I blew out of the water! I was the main one answering questions compared to the other candidates.  <endOfText>

<bot> I just put in an application to adopt a police dog who failed his training.
<human> I didn't even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training, how did it fail do you know? <endOfText>
<bot> Typically it's because they're too friendly or don't respond immediately to commands.  I know the process to get one is difficult, but I'm crossing my fingers!

<bot> I didn't even realize they let you adopt dogs that failed the training, how did it fail do you know?

<human> Yes, finally I found one. But that was a long and tiring process. I started losing hope at some point. <endOfText>
<bot> I was so embarrassed at work last week.  My boss keeps bringing up a mistake I made months back.
<human> That happens, you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them. <endOfText>
<bot> I did though, I've apologized repeatedly.  we've discussed it multiple times.  It's hard because she brings it up in front of others.
<human> Oh well that seems improper, you should bring it up to her supervisor. <endOfText>
<bot> That happens, you have to acknowledge mistakes to learn from them.
<human> I did though, I've apologized repeatedly.  we've discussed it multiple times.  It's hard because she brings it up in front of others.  <endOfText>

<bot> No matter what other people say I always buy the newest Nintendo console.
<human> I hear that.  I can't afford all of them, but I have several.  Nintendo forever! <endOfText>
<bot> I really like the Switch, I use the undocked thing all the time and play a quick game of mario kart or whatever before I hit the hay.

<bot> About a month ago i found an old family photo album that i hadn't seen in a while
<human> That's really nice. Did it make you recall any memories you had forgotten about? <endOfText>

<human> That's so stressful. <endOfText>
<bot> It was but I found everything I needed before going. Too bad it always takes so long at those offices.
<human> Yes it does. The DMV has the longest wait times. You go in first thing and already have a 45 minute wait from the get go.  <endOfText>
<bot> That's so stressful.
<human> It was but I found everything I needed before going. Too bad it always takes so long at those offices. <endOfText>

<human> Yes, but i'm also getting nervous about meeting my new class. <endOfText>
<bot> My mom has turrets and screams at people for no reason.
<human> That must be very challenging to deal with at times. <endOfText>
<bot> It is very challenging to deal with, along with being very embarrassing. Sometimes I am ashamed of her.
<human> I can understand being emabarrassed by that as well. <endOfText>
<bot> That must be very challenging to deal with at times.
<human> It is very challenging to deal with, along with being very embarrassing. Sometimes I am ashamed of her. <endOfText>
<bot> I cannot wait for a couple more weeks and football season will start.
<human> You must be excited! Are you a huge fan? <endOfText>

<bot> Well that must have been nice!  I assume you wanted it and not something different?
<human> Yeah! I was actually giddy that she remembered as silly as that sounds. <endOfText>
<bot> Two of my co-workers got into an argument in a meeting.  Loyalty is out the window now.
<human> i hate when coworkers fight, it is so uncomfortable and you don't want to take sides <endOfText>
<bot> It is so hard.  I trust both of them, but obviously they don't trust each other anymore and let loose.
<human> i do not know what to say, i guess the best thing to do is let them work it out on their own <endOfText>
<bot> i hate when coworkers fight, it is so uncomfortable and you don't want to take sides
<human> It is so hard.  I trust both of them, but obviously they don't trust each other anymore and let loose. <endOfText>

<bot> Two co-workers got into a verbal sparring match during a meeting.  It was so shameful, ugh.
<human> That's not something that should be done in a meeting. If they're going to argue it should be done in private. <endOfText>
<bot> Absolutely.  And it was so out of character of them.  I guess they had reached their breaking point.
<human> Do you know if they managed to work things out? <endOfText>
<bot> That's not something that should be done in a meeting. If they're going to argue it should be done in private.
<human> Absolutely.  And it was so out of character of them.  I guess they had reached their breaking point. <endOfText>
<bot> Do you know if they managed to work things out?
<human> A little bit but it wasn't legit.   <endOfText>
<bot> Last year a student I teach had a house fire.
<human> Oh no!  How terrible.  I hope no one was hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> Luckily no one was hurt, but he lost his home and all of his belongings.  It was awful.
<human> That is horrible.  I can't even imagine. <endOfText>

<bot> Thats not good, Did he do something to you?
<human> Yes, he bit me. But he's only a puppy, it's expected behavior. I should have known better. <endOfText>
<bot> Im sorry but you should still never hit him. It could just make him bit again

<bot> The memories were good. I was invited by the football coach to talk to the football team.
<human> Awesome!  Hopefully you gave them the motivation they needed for the new year! <endOfText>

<bot> I went to meet up with someone who was going buy a guitar from me. He lived 30 minutes away. The guy never answered his door when I got there.
<human> I hate it when that happens. I don't feel like it is necessary to flake,they should be sure before they lead people along. <endOfText>
<bot> i was so mad.  it was a $400 guitar I was selling or I'd not have driven out that way. I had him banned from the sales app i was using.
<human> That's completely reasonable considering the distance you had to drive for no reason. hopefully another interested buyer pops up soon. <endOfText>

<bot> Have you ever think you've seen a ghost?
<human> I have seen things I can't explain. I didn't stick around to ask, I ran. But afterwards I was thinking it was a ghost.  <endOfText>
<bot> when I was little and moved into a new home I saw lights moving around in my closet one night when I went to bed. I thought it was my brother messing with me but no one was around
<human> That's scary. I'm not sure what I would have done if that were me. What did you do?  <endOfText>
<bot> I coved my head with the covers and asked them to go away. I never saw them again. found out later that an old couple died in my home.
<human> Wow, that's scary. And I would have probably done the same thing.  <endOfText>

<bot> I used to draw a lot when I was younger and I put a lot of emotion in to my work.
<human> Do you still draw? I was never talented in drawing. <endOfText>
<bot> I don't draw anymore, so it brought back a lot of memories when I found an old sketchbook of mine.

<bot> When my spouse was out of town, a friend tried to kiss me!
<human> wow, i do not know either to say, way to go or you better not <endOfText>
<bot> I said no and made the friend leave. I only like my spouse.

<human> That's great! Was it Kindergarten or Pre-School? <endOfText>
<bot> Preschool, we put him in a Montessori preschool and absolutely loved it, luckily my older son has went there for 2 years and this will be his last year, so starting next week they get to go together!
<human> That's great! Did you cry when you took him? <endOfText>
<bot> i did, they had to pry him off of me haha, it was his first time being away from me, but it is only for 3 hours 3 days a week, so I know he will be fine
<human> That's true. When my kids went to school the first day, I just kept standing around until one of the teachers finally told me I could go... <endOfText>

<bot> One of my coworkers tried to flirt with me. I told him no because I am happily married.
<human> It's good that your standing up for your marriage like that. A lot of people aren't that committed. <endOfText>
<bot> No, they aren't. But I love my husband so much, I could never do that to him.
<human> You are a wonderful person then. <endOfText>
<bot> It's good that your standing up for your marriage like that. A lot of people aren't that committed.
<human> No, they aren't. But I love my husband so much, I could never do that to him.  <endOfText>
<bot> It took me 26 hours to go from Colorado to Tennessee via gps the other day.
<human> Oh no! Why do long? Did you walk? <endOfText>
<bot> No, Maps put me on a road that made me drive an old cattle line across Kansas without me knowing.
<human> That stinks, but I am sure you got to see a lot of nice scenery.  <endOfText>

<bot> I feel so bad. I ate the rest of husband's cheesecake. I feel like I need to hide from him for a while.
<human> Maybe he will understand, but just in case I'd make him a new one. <endOfText>
<bot> I guess I am going to have to. I feel so bad. :(
<human> Don't feel bad, It happens to the best of us. <endOfText>

<human> I guess I am going to have to. I feel so bad. :( <endOfText>
<bot> So, just the other day I decided to believe a woman I know about her renting her home to my family. I really thought it would happen, but she will not call me back and it has been days.
<human> Oh, wow. I hate it when people do things like that. They should just be honest and upfront to begin with instead of causing drama. <endOfText>
<bot> That is one of my biggest pet peeves. Just tell me what your intentions actually are instead of stringing me along for nothing. It would have been more than perfect for my family. I really believed her.
<human> I'm sorry it fell through, but hopefully you will find something even better, and bonus, you won't have to deal with her. <endOfText>

<human> Yea I hate the wait for aid and all the paperwork. Hopefully it is resolved soon so you can ride comfortably. <endOfText>
<bot> I think it will be another three to four weeks. I hope my car lasts that long, it's having transmission problems.

<bot> I ran into a street performer recently and I enjoyed his music.
<human> Cool. What kind of instrument were they playing? <endOfText>
<bot> He had a small guitar. I'm not sure if it has a specific name.

<human> How will you keep them out? It must be something that you can do. <endOfText>

<bot> True lol but I feel sooo guilty and I don't want anyone to have expectations that I am definitely not going to meet

<bot> Well that's a good sign. He knows you probably miss him and he wants you to know he's thinking aboutcha.
<human> Yeah I think I'm just paranoid, he's never done anything to hurt me in any way. <endOfText>
<bot> I bought a 50-50 raffle ticket at the fair a few nights ago.

<human> Oh wow, I've never heard of a dog DNA test before. What is it? <endOfText>
<bot> It's a DNA test that tells what breed(s) a dog is. We got it from an online advertisement so we don't really know what he is.
<human> That is so cool! Is it expensive to do? <endOfText>
<bot> Oh wow, I've never heard of a dog DNA test before. What is it?
<human> It's a DNA test that tells what breed(s) a dog is. We got it from an online advertisement so we don't really know what he is. <endOfText>
<bot> That is so cool! Is it expensive to do?
<human> Kind of, it was $100. But it will be worth it! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh yes, he is going to be really mad. He loves his car, it's like his baby.
<human> I bet he does.  <endOfText>
<bot> I want to tell him about it but I don't know how.
<human> Just sit him down and tell him. <endOfText>

<human> I'm pretty sure I've done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life, so don't feel bad, lol. He would probably laugh about it now if you told him. <endOfText>
<bot> haha he remembers it. He has totally gotten me back throughout the years, though.
<human> What are brothers for, am I right? The absolute best response to something like that at least between siblings is just to get that sweet payback. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm pretty sure I've done something similar to that about a hundred times in my life, so don't feel bad, lol. He would probably laugh about it now if you told him.

<human> Sure, vent whatever you need. <endOfText>
<bot> Well when I was younger I began experimenting with something some may call taboo or even wrong. I was in my mom's bedroom one day and came across some of her clothes ...
<human> Oh did you try them on? It's pretty normal, when my mom came home one day, she found me in her nightgown and highheels pretending I was going to her job. <endOfText>

<bot> Yea, My dad when he was alive was in the navy, so they paid for my brother school, but not mine as I had just moved out.

<bot> We are both fairly smart, I just had to work a fulltime job and go to school .SO harder situation.
<human> I see. Do you have any resentment? Have you done anything to take matters into your own hands to get where you'd like to be? <endOfText>

<human> Oh wow, so it was extra money that was not yours? <endOfText>

<bot> After a few years in the service industry i decided to go back to retail. Over the years I was away things had changed so much that i have to rely heavily on my trainer.
<human> Awww man, yeah the retail stores tend to change some stuff up, and sometimes it feels like you have to start all over again, but I'm sure you can push through!  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes its kinda like riding a bike in some senses there are familiar parts. A few small differences and details that you have to make sure have been pointed out to you.
<human> I'm glad it's not all different though. I'm sure the trainer will be really nice to train you because you sort of know what's going on, but just need a run down for the new responsibilities ! <endOfText>

<human> And did it not go over well? <endOfText>
<bot> Why, what's wrong?
<human> I put a lot of effort into bidding a really nice project. <endOfText>
<bot> And did it not go over well?
<human> They gave it to someone else.  I was counting on winning it.  I don't know where I went wrong. <endOfText>
<bot> I needed someone to watch my dogs last week
<human> Were you able to find someone? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, my friend volunteered to do it for free!
<human> Well that's great,  Someone you trust too. <endOfText>
<bot> Were you able to find someone?
<human> Yeah, my friend volunteered to do it for free! <endOfText>
<bot> When I was a child, my Mother and I took care of a garden allotment. I always think back on that time fondly, it was the best time of my life.
<human> That sounds so sweet, it's always nice to look back on fond times. <endOfText>
<bot> It sure is. Maybe it wasn't even that good, but, in my memory, it's perfect.
<human> Sometimes all we have is our memories. <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds so sweet, it's always nice to look back on fond times.
<human> It sure is. Maybe it wasn't even that good, but, in my memory, it's perfect. <endOfText>
<bot> So I flirted with a married woman yesterday
<human> You're such a naughty person.  What did she do? <endOfText>
<bot> She was very upset. I did not even realize she was married.
<human> Oh no.  That didn't go well then.  Look for a ring next time. <endOfText>
<bot> You're such a naughty person.  What did she do?
<human> She was very upset. I did not even realize she was married. <endOfText>
<bot> I feel really lucky even though I don't have much.

<bot> I came across a homeless person today and talked to him for a while.
<human> That's so sweet of you! <endOfText>
<bot> What makes you feel lucky?
<human> I came across a homeless person today and talked to him for a while. <endOfText>

<bot> Man i hate when family dies..:(
<human> Im guessing you must have had a family memeber die?   Im so sorry for your loss.    <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, it seems my elders are on their last legs and i just lost my father.

<bot> THat must be tough to deal with.  I cant imagine losing a parent!
<human> It gives me a perspective i've never had. <endOfText>
<bot> I hope to save up enough money to run my own guest-house one day. I daydream about it all the time.
<human> Does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free? <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, it would be rented out to earn an income - it would be my job. I think I'd let friends and family stay for free if it was vacant.
<human> Taht sounds lucrative! I have a place in Big sky MT. it worked out very wellas far as renting. <endOfText>
<bot> Does a guest house mean you rent it out or you let family and friends stay for free?
<human> Oh, it would be rented out to earn an income - it would be my job. I think I'd let friends and family stay for free if it was vacant. <endOfText>
<bot> I felt like i can't buy a car.
<human> Why's that? Are you worried about driving? <endOfText>
<bot> No the salesman won't gie me a reasonable price.
<human> Ah-ha! Do you know anyone in your family who's good at bargaining? Maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer. <endOfText>
<bot> Why's that? Are you worried about driving?
<human> No the salesman won't gie me a reasonable price. <endOfText>
<bot> Ah-ha! Do you know anyone in your family who's good at bargaining? Maybe the sales-person is a hard-bargainer.
<human> It seemed like i couldn't find anyone who wouldn't realize i knew the reasonable price for any car. <endOfText>
<bot> I saw another woman looking at my boyfriend up and down while we are in line at the store
<human> Wow, I wonder if she knew that you two were together. Did she know that you saw her? <endOfText>
<bot> I don't think so. She didn't even make eye contact with me. But at least my boyfriend didn't seem to notice. We were holding hands, so I assume she knew we were together!
<human> She totally knew! I guess it's flattering to know your partner is good looking enough to have a woman stare him down like that. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, I wonder if she knew that you two were together. Did she know that you saw her?
<human> I don't think so. She didn't even make eye contact with me. But at least my boyfriend didn't seem to notice. We were holding hands, so I assume she knew we were together! <endOfText>

<human> I have been there, done that.  I used to be a dog groomer and I love dogs.   Its so sad to go the pound and see all the homeless dogs. <endOfText>
<bot> How do you deal with it? I just want them all!
<human> I usually deal with it by not going to the pound anymore to look.   I had a dog die in a house fire not long ago and I am just not ready for a dog. <endOfText>

<human> Wow. I would not be able to not buy every animal there if that happened to me. <endOfText>
<bot> I watched a horror movie and I was afraid at night
<human> I'm such a scaredy cat when it comes to scary movies. What was the movie about? <endOfText>

<bot> I just celebrated 25 years at my job.
<human> I mean did they reward your 25 years of service at your job by giving you a present or throwing you a party. It's pretty common for workers when they reach such a milestone to be recognized in such a way. <endOfText>
<bot> I got a cake in the conference room, but I was actually on vacation when they did it, bad planning on their part.  Otherwise just my normal paycheck.
<human> You should've made them buy another cake! <endOfText>

<bot> Last month I had to give a speech in front of a lot of people. I was nervous when I first found out.
<human> Oh I'm so socially awkward and anxious I'd never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out? <endOfText>
<bot> I practiced over and over again until the day of the speech. It ended up going really well!
<human> I'm so happy to hear that! Practice does make perfect. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh I'm so socially awkward and anxious I'd never be able to give a speech. How did it turn out?

<human> Oh I am so sorry to hear that. :( I hope that she will be alright. Is it serious? <endOfText>
<bot> Nope she is dying I just heard from the doctor! It is serious situation but maybe it's make believe..
<human> Oh no! Well you better spend as much time with her as you can now. It could be any time she leaves. Oh what a heard situation you are going through! If you need a friend I am always here for you. <endOfText>

<human> You know like the make up line,  "Maybe it's may-k be-lene" Oh well, at least she will look pretty in her casket. <endOfText>
<bot> I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party, I knew I could count on him though.
<human> That's good to be able to depend on others. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I try to really value my friendships, as you never know when they might end for some unknown reason.
<human> That's so true, life is very fragile and I find it easy to forget that. <endOfText>
<bot> That's good to be able to depend on others.
<human> Yeah, I try to really value my friendships, as you never know when they might end for some unknown reason. <endOfText>
<bot> I decided to stay with my current company even tho I was offered another job.
<human> It's nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you.  Is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty? <endOfText>
<bot> It sure would be thoughtful if they did! I doubt it, but I still feel I made the right choice.
<human> Why did you choose to stay? <endOfText>
<bot> It's nice to be loyal to people who are loyal to you.  Is your job going to offer you any benefits for your loyalty?
<human> It sure would be thoughtful if they did! I doubt it, but I still feel I made the right choice.  <endOfText>
<bot> I am on a diet but I am having a hard time sticking to it.
<human> Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up!  <endOfText>
<bot> I won't but I am so desperate for good food.  I actually ate the leftover burger scraps off a plate at a restaurant the other day.  I am humiliated by it, but I really wanted a burger.
<human> Omg! Okay now I understand how difficult it really must be for you!  <endOfText>
<bot> Food is the hardest part when it comes to getting healthy sometimes. Dont give up!

<bot> I was cleaning out my bathtub drain this morning with bleach and hot water. My cat has never done this before but she jumped in and got covered in bleach and water.
<human> Oh my that must have been frightening! Poor little cat, what happened afterwards? <endOfText>
<bot> It really was. She is only 4 months old. She seemed a little irritated so I gave her a bath.
<human> I can just imagine, maybe she wanted a bath. Glad to know she wasn't harmed. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh my that must have been frightening! Poor little cat, what happened afterwards?
<human> It really was. She is only 4 months old. She seemed a little irritated so I gave her a bath. <endOfText>
<bot> My friend Karl had a party, he invited a lot of people and I was not invited. I felt really bad.
<human> That sould make me feel sad. Did you talk to him about it? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, I asked him why wasn't I invited he came up with some lame excuse.
<human> That's not very nice. I think it is just better to be honest, even if it might hurt. <endOfText>
<bot> That sould make me feel sad. Did you talk to him about it?
<human> Yes, I asked him why wasn't I invited he came up with some lame excuse. <endOfText>
<bot> That's not very nice. I think it is just better to be honest, even if it might hurt.
<human> That is what I think too , I thought I was his best friend but I guess I was wrong.  <endOfText>
<bot> I ate a small pizza to myself.... literally no self control! ugh
<human> I certainly know that feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> Im supposed to be eating healthier, and major failed this week.
<human> You can always improve that anytime you want to.  I have faith in you. <endOfText>
<bot> I certainly know that feeling.
<human> Im supposed to be eating healthier, and major failed this week.  <endOfText>
<bot> I took money from my brother's wallet to buy beer.
<human> Do you plan on paying him back quickly?  <endOfText>
<bot> I might, but I feel really guilty about admitting it.
<human> I mean its pretty crappy to take anything from anyone, but hes your brother so it is slightly less crappy as long as you pay him back!  <endOfText>
<bot> Do you plan on paying him back quickly?
<human> I might, but I feel really guilty about admitting it. <endOfText>
<bot> I used to work as a flooring specialist at a major chain home improvement store. It was a good place to work until I got a new supervisor who thought he could disrespect me without consequences.
<human> Uh oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor. <endOfText>
<bot> We got into several arguments and management decided to ignore  the problem and hope it would blow over. After a few weeks I turned in my resignation.
<human> Unfortunately he wins out when you do that because it will likely continue.  Again, I wish you had been treated so unkindly. <endOfText>
<bot> Uh oh.  I'm sorry to hear that.  That is never a good thing to do as a supervisor.
<human> We got into several arguments and management decided to ignore  the problem and hope it would blow over. After a few weeks I turned in my resignation.  <endOfText>
<bot> I had my own issues at work.  I was gossiping at work the other day with a coworker of mine.
<human> Something juicy I hope.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah...just as I called the boss fat and lazy, she comes walking around the corner and hears me. I felt pretty vulnerable at that moment
<human> Whoops! Did she take it with anything approaching a sense of humor? <endOfText>
<bot> Something juicy I hope.
<human> Yeah...just as I called the boss fat and lazy, she comes walking around the corner and hears me. I felt pretty vulnerable at that moment <endOfText>
<bot> So i was putting some stuff in my attic and i noticed a terrible smell.
<human> Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it? <endOfText>
<bot> I found a dead rat up there, now im worried i might have more
<human> Yuck! You better put a trap up there. You know they have these wireless web cams these days for really cheap so it may be a good idea to get one of those so you know for sure if you have an infestation. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! I am afraid to ask what it was.... but what was it?
<human> I found a dead rat up there, now im worried i might have more <endOfText>
<bot> My daughter borrowed my car the other day and you won't believe what happened.
<human> Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it? <endOfText>
<bot> Not quite. She tapped another car in the parking lot. It has a big scratch on it now.
<human> I am so sorry to hear about that. The good thing is she is okay <endOfText>
<bot> It was a new car so I'm pretty ticked off.
<human> I would be upset as well <endOfText>
<bot> Oh dear. Is it what I am thinking? Did she wreck it?

<bot> I am so sorry to hear about that. The good thing is she is okay
<human> It was a new car so I'm pretty ticked off. <endOfText>
<bot> The day finally came for me to move and to my surprise my family came over to help.
<human> Wow, that's really great that they pitched in to help. You must be happy about that! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh yes I was, I had so many furniture.
<human> The more hands, the quicker the work! <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, that's really great that they pitched in to help. You must be happy about that!
<human> Oh yes I was, I had so many furniture. <endOfText>
<bot> The more hands, the quicker the work!
<human> That is so right, I really appreciate the help.  <endOfText>
<bot> I made a deal with myself to work out more to get leaner. I've been so down on myself about it lately.
<human> Making moves to do better is all you can do.  How has it been going? <endOfText>
<bot> At first it was really tough and I almost gave up on it a few times, but I turned it around and I've been feeling great.
<human> That is great!  The longer you do it the easier it will get.  Keep up the good work! <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you so much that actually gives me a boost to read that.
<human> No problem! <endOfText>

<bot> I got invited to speak at a conference, but I'm not sure I want to do it.
<human> What were you invited to speak about? <endOfText>
<bot> About online marketing.  I have never spoken in front of a big crowd before and I am very nervous about it.
<human> It's hard to condense a pep talk into nice little one liners. But I think if you just go for it, breathe deeply a bunch, and pretend it's just you in that room, I think you'll do great! <endOfText>
<bot> What were you invited to speak about?
<human> About online marketing.  I have never spoken in front of a big crowd before and I am very nervous about it. <endOfText>
<bot> I had to take a test for work and didnt have time to study so i snuck notes in so i could get a high score.
<human> i hate to ask what happen, I imagine something went wrong <endOfText>
<bot> no i actually got promoted because of my high score, but i felt bad for cheating.
<human> that is the problem with cheating, you have to live with it especially if you have a conscious, all I can say is to use this promotion as a lesson to better prepare yourself next time <endOfText>
<bot> i hate to ask what happen, I imagine something went wrong
<human> no i actually got promoted because of my high score, but i felt bad for cheating.  <endOfText>
<bot> I pretended not to hear a friend of mine when she was calling to me from down the road.
<human> Had she been bothering you recently? <endOfText>
<bot> Not really but she was rude the last time I saw her.  I just got in my car and drove away.  I feel so bad now though for not just waving hi.
<human> I get that. I don't respond well when people are rude to me. <endOfText>
<bot> Had she been bothering you recently?
<human> Not really but she was rude the last time I saw her.  I just got in my car and drove away.  I feel so bad now though for not just waving hi. <endOfText>
<bot> My grocery delivery was 2 hours late. They said they'd give me one discount but gave me two. I should probably tell them but I'm keeping them.
<human> What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they' <endOfText>
<bot> Well I kinda feel bad because they essentially gave me $40 off an $80 order.
<human> Oops, sorry, I didn't finish my thought.  I think they make enough money to handle it and that inconvenience is worth $80.  Plus now you'll definitely buy again with them so I think it works in their favor and yours! <endOfText>
<bot> What a pain!  I think when a big company makes so much money and they say they'
<human> Well I kinda feel bad because they essentially gave me $40 off an $80 order.  <endOfText>
<bot> So my school started back up this week. I was so ready to take on the year!
<human> That's awesome. It's wonderful to feel prepared! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah it was a great feeling! i felt on top of everything
<human> Now you just have to keep up that same energy all year, that's the difficult part. <endOfText>

<human> Oh no!  Hopefully you have full coverage?  <endOfText>
<bot> Luckily I was required to have it, but my insurance rates are going to go through the roof.
<human> Yeah but, its better than having no car! <endOfText>
<bot> true.

<human> How much did she give you over <endOfText>
<bot> I gave her a 10 and she gave me change for a 20, so 10 bucks
<human> Most places will make her replace the 10 so you should really go back to there and explain what happened <endOfText>
<bot> How much did she give you over
<human> I gave her a 10 and she gave me change for a 20, so 10 bucks <endOfText>

<human> Oh no!  They are mean to not have told you.  I would've told you.  How did it even get there? <endOfText>

<human> Oops!  Well, just hold your head high because things happen to all of us and it doesn't speak to who you are as a person so just let it roll off your chest.  Shame that people are decent enough to help. <endOfText>

<bot> I got to visit with some of my old high school friends a few weeks ago. It's hard to believe it's been over thirty years since we first met.
<human> I bet that was nice though. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, there's only one of them I really keep up with. I'll probably never see the other two again.
<human> Does your high school do reunions where you could see them again? <endOfText>
<bot> I bet that was nice though.
<human> Yeah, there's only one of them I really keep up with. I'll probably never see the other two again.  <endOfText>
<bot> My puppy fell off the couch and hurt his paw.
<human> Wow, what happened next, is he alright? <endOfText>
<bot> He is fine now, but I took a couple of days off of work to nurse him back to health.  Poor little thing.
<human> Wow what type of dog is he? Is he a big one that acts tough or a little one that needs lots of love? <endOfText>
<bot> He is a baby Australian Shepherd.  Just a sweet little thing.
<human> Wow, I actually love them! Did you take him to see a vet? You seem so concerned about him to even take time off work. <endOfText>
<bot> I was very concerned.  We went to the vet and she said it was probably just a sprain.  Better safe than sorry, though.
<human> I am so glad to hear that. A healthy puppy makes everyone happy. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow, what happened next, is he alright?
<human> He is fine now, but I took a couple of days off of work to nurse him back to health.  Poor little thing. <endOfText>

<human> Nice!  What did you end up with? <endOfText>
<bot> I ended up getting a google pixel 2. I know it is a little expensive but I wanted to have a good phone that will last a long time.
<human> I say if you can afford it enjoy it.  What is your favorite feature? <endOfText>

<human> Wow, love looking through memorable s. brings back good memories. <endOfText>
<bot> It's pretty great, its not often you come by such a small relic... and from all the way back in 1954

<bot> I had a bad headache this morning. I had coffee delivered and was so thankful for it.
<human> Yeah, I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too. <endOfText>
<bot> Yep but also drinking coffee causes more headaches in general. I try to avoid it unless I already have a headache.
<human> I wish I could say the same. I am addicted. :( <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I know what you mean. Coffee always cures my headache. But then again it is probably not having coffee that causes the headache too.

<human> That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get chewed out too badly. <endOfText>
<bot> I did. I got caught by my supervisor and she said I will be put on probation.
<human> I guess they don't see it as just copy paper. To them stealing is stealing no matter how petty. At least you have the chance to change your ways and keep your job. <endOfText>
<bot> That's unfortunate. I hope you didn't get chewed out too badly.
<human> I did. I got caught by my supervisor and she said I will be put on probation. <endOfText>

<bot> I think so, but I still feel physically sick because of the devastation. I feel like I have no idea what I am going to do now

<bot> Earlier a phd student posted he wanted to talk to someone on a fb online forum , i did he sounded like a nice kid , he promised to pay me , i trusted him
<human> That's good that you trusted him. Sometimes I miss out on good opportunities because it is hard to trust. <endOfText>
<bot> its good that i trusted him it was like a 5 minute call, and he promised me some money i checked and the money was already in there 5.00 dollars
<human> That's awesome. That's a good amount for a little effort which is always nice.  <endOfText>

<human> haha... you little thief! (joking) That must have been some good pizza! <endOfText>
<bot> It was not bad.. from a local place. New York style, which is my favorite. I'm sure they didn't really care in the grand scheme of things.. I just hadn't eaten all day and still felt like a hungry pig even after we had some during the meeting. Someone mentioned they wanted to take the leftovers home to their spouse too, so that made me feel a little bad
<human> Ahhh, oh well. Don't beat yourself up. I am pretty sure that I have done something like that before too. I think it was with birthday cake. I love birthday cake!!!!! <endOfText>

<bot> So, is it wrong to not want your child to join a sport because you just don't want to have to take them to practices?
<human> Haha! No! It's not wrong! My son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ballfields! <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds awful! I feel a bit ashamed, but I really just want to talk him out of doing it.
<human> It's a huge commitment for him and you! If you don't think you can do it, I wouldn't sign him up. There's no shame in that! <endOfText>

<human> Was it a good feeling or a bad feeling? <endOfText>
<bot> A good one. I missed the old days.

<bot> August is coming to an end. I always go back to my childhood when the last week before school starts were some of the most exciting times of my young life.
<human> What did you get up to in August usually? <endOfText>
<bot> A lot of horsing around usually, but many adventures at what seemed like a far distance away from home. I always choke up thinking about it.
<human> I used to love bonfires back in my day those were the days. <endOfText>
<bot> Times were so much more simpler back then.

<bot> It's fun, but also a bit yucky. He isn't litter trained yet and has made a mess of the carpets.

<human> Oh no! How gross! That must have been so embarrassing! Were you able to clean yourself up? <endOfText>
<bot> It was so awful and disgusting.  I actually just left because I was so grossed out that I wanted to go home and take a shower.

<human> It's great that you only have one more year left! What are you getting a degree in? <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks! I appreciate that. I actually am getting a degree in social work. At the moment, I'm just trying not to become the needy/helpless demographic I seek to serve in a career after I graduate

<bot> Is it wrong to be jealous of your best friend?
<human> I think it's just human nature. Even if it were wrong, there may be nothing you can do about it. But I think there are ways you can take your negative emotions and put a positive spin on them, in order to motivate you in a more healthy, conducive way. <endOfText>
<bot> That's true. She just sold her book to a publisher and it is just a little weird.
<human> I could see that... Yeah. Well, I hope you are able to re-invest that energy into your own passions. I think you could do a lot for yourself. <endOfText>

<bot> My dad got my brother a watch but not me.
<human> Did you want a watch? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, and I feel kind of envious of my brother now.

<bot> Is it your first ferrari?
<human> LOL, no.  But I can still remember watching my beloved late grandfather stroking the 1.3 million dollar check.  I was very fond of him. <endOfText>
<bot> My neighbor asked me out on a date, even  though he knows I am married. I told him no.

<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there a reason why you couldn't? <endOfText>
<bot> I just don't have the funds or time away from work. Even my sister and her husband, who are as broke as me, went on one.
<human> To be fair, travelling is expensive and probably overrated to a certain extent. I hope you do find the time to take some time away from work so you can enjoy yourself though. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there a reason why you couldn't?
<human> I just don't have the funds or time away from work. Even my sister and her husband, who are as broke as me, went on one. <endOfText>

<human> No worries! That's so awesome. Are you taking lessons from a musician in a class, one on one, or online? <endOfText>
<bot> Five is a great number, but six is even better. It's my favorite number, don't know why either!

<bot> My roommate wants to get a cat. But he's already irresponsible enough as it is, and can't clean up after himself. How can he clean up after a cat, too? But I don't want to be the person to say no..
<human> I think you will need to tell him how you feel about this. Otherwise you may end up taking more care of the cat than him. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, you're right. I'm not good at confrontation, however. But yeah, I've already decided I don't want to take care of the cat myself, so if he can't do it, then it shouldn't be here. I just think he's kind of childish in the sense that he'll assume he can do it just so he can have the cat in the beginning, but later on he will get lazy.
<human> Yea it will be unfair for the cat too who may feel lonely and unloved. You should tell him to be more responsible before he can get a pet. <endOfText>
<bot> I think you will need to tell him how you feel about this. Otherwise you may end up taking more care of the cat than him.

<human> Oh no! Those little ones seem to do stuff like that all the time. <endOfText>
<bot> I can't get it off the furniture which he just bought used but still new to us.  My blood was boiling but I tried to stay calm and firm.
<human> Did you try this stuff called "GOOF OFF"? Give that a try or some vinegar. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! Those little ones seem to do stuff like that all the time.
<human> I can't get it off the furniture which he just bought used but still new to us.  My blood was boiling but I tried to stay calm and firm. <endOfText>

<bot> Oh no, did it burn?
<human> Well, it was so dry I had to find something else to eat. I was so mad! <endOfText>
<bot> I hate when I do that, but it is better for it to be cooked to long, than not long enough....
<human> Thats true. lol <endOfText>

<human> That must of been fun, where did you meet? <endOfText>
<bot> It was fun. We held it at a beautiful state park and everything was perfect.
<human> That is amazing. I hope I can get the family together soon. <endOfText>
<bot> That must of been fun, where did you meet?
<human> It was fun. We held it at a beautiful state park and everything was perfect. <endOfText>
<bot> I failed my math exam. I am an idiot.
<human> Oh no, that's terrible. Is there anyway to redo it? <endOfText>
<bot> No, I will just have to get an A on my final.
<human> You better prepare well for that final. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, that's terrible. Is there anyway to redo it?
<human> No, I will just have to get an A on my final. <endOfText>

<human> That's wonderful!  Are you thinking of proposing? <endOfText>
<bot> maybe, we are not really set financially yet is all
<human> That's a good thing to be financially prepared, trust me.  My husband and I spent most of the money we had on a honeymoon and then struggled for years doing things the wrong way. You're smart! <endOfText>
<bot> That's wonderful!  Are you thinking of proposing?
<human> maybe, we are not really set financially yet is all <endOfText>
<bot> I am so mad at my bank. they somehow thought to charge me for a credit card i didn't want.
<human> That is not good. Did they give you back your money?  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes but i had to spend a whole hour on the phone explaining why they were at fault.
<human> I would be upset too, they need to do their work properly. <endOfText>
<bot> I agree!
<human> I am glad that you got it cleared up. <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you. I hope they won't do anything like that in the future.
<human> I hope so too, you should have reported it to a supervisor or manager. <endOfText>
<bot> That is not good. Did they give you back your money?

<bot> I am thinking about looking for a new job.
<human> Why? Are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money? <endOfText>
<bot> It is going fine but I would like to be closer to home. I just do not know if I should give this job up.
<human> Well I guess you should probably find a new job before quitting your present job. <endOfText>
<bot> Why? Are you not happy with the job or you want to make more money?
<human> It is going fine but I would like to be closer to home. I just do not know if I should give this job up. <endOfText>
<bot> Recently I was looking to buy a car and even when I am not in the market anymore, sales people keep calling me everyday
<human> I have had that happen before and it is super annoying! <endOfText>
<bot> Yes I guess next time I will give them a false number.
<human> I do not blame you one bit! <endOfText>
<bot> I have had that happen before and it is super annoying!
<human> Yes I guess next time I will give them a false number. <endOfText>
<bot> I love video games , i used to love going to the arcades i would rack so many wins , and usually bummed when i would lose , ah the good old days
<human> That sounds fun!  The arcades were always kind of noisy for me though. <endOfText>
<bot> Its not for everyone , everytime i see an arcade its a blast from the past
<human> You should go in a play some! <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds fun!  The arcades were always kind of noisy for me though.
<human> Its not for everyone , everytime i see an arcade its a blast from the past <endOfText>
<bot> I have to go back to work soon after being off on maternity leave.
<human> Oh, that's so hard! How are you feeling about it? Itching to go back, or dreading it? <endOfText>
<bot> I am dreading it because I do not like leaving my baby with anyone. I will be leaving her with a neighbor that I know will be good.
<human> That's good! At least it's someone you can trust instead of a stranger at a daycare center.  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, that's so hard! How are you feeling about it? Itching to go back, or dreading it?
<human> I am dreading it because I do not like leaving my baby with anyone. I will be leaving her with a neighbor that I know will be good. <endOfText>
<bot> My son had an ingrown toenail so I took him to the podiatrist today. It was pretty gross!
<human> Ouch! What did they do for it? <endOfText>
<bot> He numbed up the toe and dug out the section that was ingrown. It was all red and infected. My poor kid!
<human> That sounds so painful! I hope it gets better fast. <endOfText>
<bot> Ouch! What did they do for it?
<human> He numbed up the toe and dug out the section that was ingrown. It was all red and infected. My poor kid! <endOfText>
<bot> my job interview coming up has me pretty nervous. I keep thinking about it.
<human> That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes. I have trouble presenting my true self when under pressure.
<human> Ah.  I find a mock interview with a friend can help. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh good idea! I will try that today.
<human> Good luck! <endOfText>
<bot> That can be nerve wracking.  Are you worried?
<human> Yes. I have trouble presenting my true self when under pressure. <endOfText>
<bot> Ah.  I find a mock interview with a friend can help.
<human> Oh good idea! I will try that today. <endOfText>
<bot> I went to the doctor on Monday.
<human> That is smart of you. How did it go? <endOfText>
<bot> Not fun.  They did a biopsy.
<human> I am sure you will be OK. The doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that aren't worth it. <endOfText>
<bot> That is smart of you. How did it go?
<human> Not fun.  They did a biopsy. <endOfText>
<bot> I am sure you will be OK. The doctors can be very scary sometimes but most people get scared about things that aren't worth it.

<bot> My old cat is very sick and we have to put her down next week.
<human> that is so sad to hear, it must be tough for you <endOfText>

<bot> that is so sad to hear, it must be tough for you
<human> It is very difficult. She is 23 years old. <endOfText>

<human> I can't help but be a little jealous. haha <endOfText>
<bot> Good job! Hopefully she deserves the faithful person you are!
<human> SHe really is great for me. I cant imagine being with anyone else. <endOfText>
<bot> My mom can be a little too persistent about things she doesn't know much about.
<human> Its possible she is just trying to be helpful. <endOfText>
<bot> I feel like she wants to be in charge too much. it is kind of sad to watch.
<human> I can see how that would be really annoying. Just nod and say yeah. Thats what works for me. <endOfText>
<bot> Its possible she is just trying to be helpful.
<human> I feel like she wants to be in charge too much. it is kind of sad to watch. <endOfText>
<bot> I can see how that would be really annoying. Just nod and say yeah. Thats what works for me.
<human> That's good advice. It's not smart to get worked up over people who won't change. <endOfText>
<bot> My nephew took me riding with him after he got his drivers license. I had to believe that he would keep us safe.
<human> Did he live up to the belief? <endOfText>
<bot> It was a bit scary but we survived.
<human> That's great!  I'm sure he appreciated that you trusted him. <endOfText>
<bot> Did he live up to the belief?
<human> It was a bit scary but we survived. <endOfText>
<bot> My nephew just started talking full sentences!
<human> How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts. <endOfText>
<bot> I know, it's so crazy!  He went from saying basically nothing to having full conversations.
<human> Now you will have to really be careful what you say around him. They tend to repeat everything they hear when you least suspect it. <endOfText>
<bot> How exciting for you. Kids truly are amazing. Now the fun really starts.
<human> I know, it's so crazy!  He went from saying basically nothing to having full conversations. <endOfText>
<bot> I was able to graduate today after 4 years of school!
<human> That is great! Congrats! <endOfText>

<bot> My sister's husband is going out of town for the weekend and she hates being alone.
<human> Aw, will you be able to keep her company? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes. I invited her to come stay with me while he is gone.
<human> That is very thoughtful of you. You are a good sister! <endOfText>
<bot> Aw, will you be able to keep her company?
<human> Yes. I invited her to come stay with me while he is gone. <endOfText>
<bot> I just learned that my niece was invited to the honor program in her new high school
<human> Aw, nice! That's kind of cool, actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff, so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great. <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you for the advise, I'll do my best not to pressure her
<human> Yeah, I think her parents or her peers, or even herself probably, may put  a lot of expectations on her. While you want to reassure and encourage her, it's good to not make her plan too far ahead in the future and put all that weight on her. It's what my parents did with me, and I resented them for it. <endOfText>
<bot> Aw, nice! That's kind of cool, actually. I hope you really encourage her to stick to it and do well. Sometimes there can be a lot of expectations that come with that stuff, so whatever you can do to not add pressure to it would be great.
<human> Thank you for the advise, I'll do my best not to pressure her <endOfText>
<bot> Roommate just walked in on me while I was... trying to... "feel good" if you know what I mean. So awkward. My door doesn't have a lock, either. I told him to not come in, and he just kept coming in!
<human> I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, I was... self-pleasuring, if you can understand that. It was definitely an awkward and embarrassing position to be in. I just went out there and tried to have a normal conversation afterwards so that we could move on as quickly as possible. But I was mortified.
<human> Yes what I thought,  I guess your roommate must have been more embarrassed. <endOfText>
<bot> I not sure what do you mean, but can use my imagination,  it sounds like something really embarrassing.

<bot> My mom just texted me a picture of her and I when I was really young. I'm on the other side of the country right now, and it made me miss her badly. Wish there was a way I had money to surprise visit her.
<human> Dang, i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick. <endOfText>
<bot> I know, right? And she's going through a tough time right now with my other brother, so I feel really bad for her. And I feel helpless since there's not much I can offer. I just try not to cause problems for her or make her worry, at the very least.
<human> At least now a ways you can face time or call her to at least stay in contact. <endOfText>
<bot> Dang, i can relate i moved away from my mom a long time ago and still get a little homesick.

<bot> I was at a friends house and he had the grossest kitchen i had ever seen!
<human> I feel like this is me. I'm clean, but I'm stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn't do dishes. And I also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with. Sorry you have to deal with that, because I know I hate living in it! <endOfText>
<bot> Oh man at least i don't have to live with it. I don't know how people are ok with nasty homelifves.
<human> Me either. I've always been a fairly clean person. Had to move out of my parents home for college, and both roommates I've had have been kind of messy. I don't know how people don't feel weird and uncomfortable making other people live in/clean up their mess. <endOfText>
<bot> I feel like this is me. I'm clean, but I'm stuck with a dirty roommate who doesn't do dishes. And I also live in a place that is old and looks terrible to begin with. Sorry you have to deal with that, because I know I hate living in it!

<human> Some people are just wired differently i guess. <endOfText>
<bot> I got lost in a bad part of town
<human> Oh no! That can be very scary! Did you make it out ok? <endOfText>
<bot> I did, thankfully. I had to rely on someone else's directions.

<bot> A complete stranger.
<human> Haha wow, thats cool.  <endOfText>

<human> That is awesome, I remember Odell Beckham doing that a few years ago. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh really, what was the play?
<human> A wide reciever in a football game made a one handed catch. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm in a really awkward position. My best friend is cheating on his girlfriend, and my own girlfriend is telling me I need to speak up and reveal his secret. No idea what to do, and I'm disappointed in my friend, too.
<human> That's horrible. I'd talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly. <endOfText>
<bot> You're right. I'm worried about having to possibly lose my best friend. I'm worried about having to stick my nose in other people's personal affairs. I'm worried about my girlfriend being mad about me being involved in it. It's all just a big hassle.
<human> If your best friend is truly a best friend of yours, they won't leave you over this. It isn't right to tell his girlfriend in my opinion, but it is good if you speak to him about the situation. <endOfText>
<bot> That's horrible. I'd talk to your best friend and tell him how you feel firstly.

<human> That's wonderful news. I have also battled depression and am feeling better now. That  is a real big deal. <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks, I am hopeful that I can now restart my life where I left off before my depression. I will be completing my BA in a few months.
<human> Wow! congrats and keep it up. I know it helps me to stay really busy. <endOfText>

<bot> My daughter came to visit today. We had a really nice day.
<human> Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes. I brought out the old photo album and we looked through and talked about the old days.
<human> Aw it must have felt so nostalgic going through old memories. Its nice to cherish them.  <endOfText>
<bot> Thats nice to  hear. Its the best feeling when kids come back home to visit.
<human> Yes. I brought out the old photo album and we looked through and talked about the old days. <endOfText>
<bot> My husband's been out of town this week, and will be gone for another week.
<human> Do you miss him? <endOfText>
<bot> I do.  It's so quiet without him, I can't get used to it.
<human> Be sure to facetime or skype with him. That will help with the loneliness.  <endOfText>
<bot> Do you miss him?
<human> I do.  It's so quiet without him, I can't get used to it. <endOfText>
<bot> My son informed me today that he was charged with possession of drugs
<human> Oh no, that's terrible.  Is he in legal trouble? <endOfText>
<bot> I suppose so. This is not how I taught to be and am so disappointed he has done this.
<human> This is such a difficult thing for you to go through.  I hope he learns from this and changes his path. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, that's terrible.  Is he in legal trouble?
<human> I suppose so. This is not how I taught to be and am so disappointed he has done this.  <endOfText>
<bot> My son will be turning 2 in a few months, and I am a little sad about it.
<human> How come? <endOfText>
<bot> Time just goes by so quickly.
<human> I understand. But you must cherish every moment because soon our babies grow up and become great adults. <endOfText>
<bot> How come?
<human> Time just goes by so quickly. <endOfText>
<bot> I rented out my bedroom to Airbnb customers and when I returned it was left smelly and diapers every where.
<human> Oh, that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you! <endOfText>
<bot> Its okay. I called a deep cleaning company to clean it up because I so disgusted by it.
<human> I don't blame you, I wouldn't want to mess with that either.  <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, that is horrible. I am sorry that happened to you!
<human> Its okay. I called a deep cleaning company to clean it up because I so disgusted by it. <endOfText>
<bot> So jealous of my buddy.
<human> Why is that, might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively. <endOfText>
<bot> He got some new shoes and mine are old and beat up.
<human> Oh, I see. Yeah, it kind of stinks being around people who can afford things you would like. But maybe you can view it as you being more mindful and responsible with your money. <endOfText>
<bot> Why is that, might I ask? Maybe I can help you reframe it better to look at it more positively.
<human> He got some new shoes and mine are old and beat up. <endOfText>
<bot> Was able to negotiate the rent of my apartment back down to a better rate, after they had raised it for the new year. I was kind of worried I'd have to find a new place, but now I don't have to move anything and go through that annoying process
<human> That's very lucky of you, what do you plan on doing now? <endOfText>
<bot> Not much. I plan on being able to relax now and not have to worry about finding a place and moving before school starts. I was really worried about it, since it was coming down to the wire. I can barely make the rent payments, but at least I won't have to pay for moving costs and all that.
<human> If you did have to move, might I suggest Boston as an alternative? <endOfText>
<bot> That's very lucky of you, what do you plan on doing now?
<human> Not much. I plan on being able to relax now and not have to worry about finding a place and moving before school starts. I was really worried about it, since it was coming down to the wire.

<bot> I'm nervous about this test I did.
<human> Don't be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head. <endOfText>
<bot> I studied pretty hard so I'm hoping for a great mark.
<human> Oh good, then there is nothing you should be worried about then. :) Go relax and distract your mind on something else. All will work out my friend. <endOfText>
<bot> Don't be nervous. I am sure you did alright. It is normal to think that but most of the time it is all in the head.

<bot> I really miss my aunt. I am a bit of a loner and she was the one i always talked to. I had to move far away from her recently.
<human> I hope you feel better soon. Maybe you can take a trip out to visit her? <endOfText>
<bot> Here soon i plan on it. And thank you! I am sure she feels the same way.
<human> I bet she really misses you. How far away did you move? <endOfText>
<bot> About 600 miles. So i'll most likely fly.
<human> Oh wow, that's really far! Well I hope you get to go soon and have a safe trip! <endOfText>

<bot> I've been considering adopting a cat, but I already have three dogs and I'm a bit afraid they won't take a liking to a new animal, much less a cat.
<human> Yea that can be tough. What kind of dogs? Are they easy to train? <endOfText>
<bot> They're all huskies, so they're very smart dogs. Maybe I can slowly introduce them to the idea and keep them separated in different rooms.
<human> Yup. I did that with my new cat and it ended up working out OK. <endOfText>
<bot> Really? Well that gives me more confidence to take the dive and adopt a kitty!
<human> Yup! I am sure you guys will get through it! <endOfText>

<bot> My college entrance exam is tomorrow and I can't stop thinking I will fail.
<human> I can understand the anxiety, I'm sure you'll do fine though! <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks. I hope I can at least get some sleep so that I cam fresh in the morning.
<human> Sleep is so important before an exam, that's where all your facts and memories get better organized <endOfText>

<bot> "I was thinking about going camping, but I'm worried about the weather ruining it.
<human> Is it possible to re-arrange the date to when the weather would be more favorable? <endOfText>
<bot> Unfortunately not, this time is the only time I can get off work until a few months later.
<human> I see. You shouldn't let it spoil your plans. Go and have fun but take a rain coat with you! <endOfText>

<bot> I have been working on training my puppy. He just started to grasp sitting.
<human> Oh nice!! What kind of treats are you using? <endOfText>
<bot> We use his food and some bananas. He loves them and is allergic to a lot of different treats.
<human> Oh, I see. I give my dogs popcorn and they love it! <endOfText>

<bot> Man.....my cat died:( I feel horrible.
<human> That's awful, how did your cat die? <endOfText>
<bot> Old age. she had a good life but it's still tearing me up.

<bot> Feeling pretty good about this upcoming math exam.
<human> That's good! Do you usually like math? <endOfText>

<bot> Someone had to walk into the bathroom after I had used it and made it smell really badly. As I was leaving, they made a comment about how bad it smelled, and I couldn't help but cringe
<human> I am sorry to hear that, it is pretty embarassing to be in situations like that <endOfText>
<bot> I know... nothing I could have avoided. Either that, or soil myself in public. Yeah, easy choice. I guess we all have those experiences from time to time. I will never eat spicy Indian food again, unless it's at home.
<human> Haha I hear you there, that stuff is potent <endOfText>

<bot> I am happy with my life right now, everything is going well
<human> It's good to hear someone doing well for once. Most people are usually only up for complaining and seeing the negatives in things. I don't want to be too nosey, but can you tell me why you're feeling good about things lately? <endOfText>
<bot> I have a good relationship, good friends, a decent job, and no debt! not much to complain about I guess!
<human> Man.. I wish I could join you in the no debt part. That sounds like it took a lot of work. You're reaping the rewards. I hope things continue to stay stable for you, and you can keep it going until setting up a good retirement. <endOfText>

<bot> I saw a strange shadow in the kitchen at night and froze in fear!
<human> Wow I bet you were terrified! Did you see again after or just that once. <endOfText>
<bot> Just the once. I couldnt even sleep the whole night thinking it was a ghost!
<human> I bet, I wouldn't be able to sleep after either. <endOfText>

<bot> My dog is getting on my nerves. he never shuts up.
<human> Sorry to hear that. What is he barking at? <endOfText>
<bot> The freaking wall from waht i can tell.
<human> Maybe turn on the TV and find a show about dogs. He might be too distracted to bark. <endOfText>

<bot> I got new neighbors recently. I wanted to do something nice so I baked a meatloaf for them. The problem is it smelled so good I had to try it first.
<human> Haha that's not a problem! You must be a good cook! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah well it becomes a problem when I keep eating a little more until it is half gone. Now I have to bake another one! I felt so bad.
<human> Hahaha that's funny. Sorry but i find that hilarious. <endOfText>

<bot> I worked really hard for a promotion at work and I ended up not getting it.
<human> That is a shame! I'm sorry to hear that. If you really like you job then just keep working hard. I am sure they will recognize your efforts pretty soon. <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you! I will keep trying and work harder next time.
<human> Go get them my friend!! I know you can do it! <endOfText>

<bot> I really enjoyed caring for patients in the Emergency Room while working at my previous job.
<human> That's great. Are you a nurse? <endOfText>
<bot> I was a patient access representative. I gathered information for the patients.
<human> That sounds like a really cool profession <endOfText>
<bot> That's great. Are you a nurse?
<human> I was a patient access representative. I gathered information for the patients. <endOfText>
<bot> I was so into that guy. I thought he was really attractive.
<human> Is there any chance for something to happen? Seems like you developed a connection from afar, if he's still on your mind. Why do you think there's no chance? <endOfText>
<bot> I really shouldn't because I have a serious boyfriend.
<human> Oh.. well that complicates things. Yeah, maybe that will make you seriously examine things. I think you're okay as long as you don't do anything while still in a relationship. But if you feel your current one is lacking something, and your eye is wandering, you owe it to yourself and your current boyfriend to reflect on why that is, and if there can be improvements, or if you should both move on. <endOfText>

<bot> My girlfriend has been acting suspicious lately. Guarding her phone, being absent here and there when she didn't used to be. Having weird excuses for her weird behavior. She tells me nothing is going on, and I try to believe her. I don't know how much longer that will last.
<human> I'm sorry. It can be hard to be in a situation where you think the other person is cheating. Is there any other reason she might be acting suspicious? Have you talked to her about it? <endOfText>
<bot> I've talked to her about it a lot. At this point, I start to feel whiney. But I don't know what else to do. Avoid it when there's still concern? I'm still not getting the answers I want, and I still have suspicions.
<human> Maybe you just need to give her some space. Women tend to pull back when they feel like they are being smothered. Either it works or she moves on. No matter which happens you know. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm sorry. It can be hard to be in a situation where you think the other person is cheating. Is there any other reason she might be acting suspicious? Have you talked to her about it?

<bot> I was sad as a kid when my pants fell down in class, everyone laughed at me
<human> Oh yeah, that is pretty embarrassing! But just imagine if you watched that happen to someone else. You would probably be laughing too. Lol <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I definitely would have at that age haha
<human> It would be pretty embarrassing too if it happened as an adult..... and I guess pretty funny watching it too. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh yeah, that is pretty embarrassing! But just imagine if you watched that happen to someone else. You would probably be laughing too. Lol
<human> Yeah I definitely would have at that age haha <endOfText>
<bot> i am so appreciative to be able to be open and honest with my husband and to be able to have an amazing relationship
<human> I agree! I'm in a long distance relationship, but we've developed so much trust over the 7 years we've been together that I never worry about what she's doing or who she's with, and neither does she worry about me. We've slowly built up our communication over the years. I'm glad to hear that you have the same thing in yours. <endOfText>
<bot> we started off long distance and i moved here shortly after. now we've been together going on 6 and a half years
<human> You guys sound a lot like us. Glad to see that long distance can work for a change. It takes strong, honest, communicative people. It gets a bad reputation sometimes, when it shouldn't. I hope we end up like you guys and can end the long distance thing soon, though. Gets a little stale. <endOfText>

<bot> Mentioned my company on social media the other day. Now I'm getting told I have to meet with management after the weekend for something they can't talk about until then. I'm not sure how they could know about what I said, but I have no idea what else it could be, and I'm nervous.
<human> try not to stress out about it all weekend. if you didn't do anything wrong nothing bad will happen. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I tell myself I shouldn't, but I know I will. Like, there's no way they could tie my social media to me. But I never get called in to meet with these people. And it happens right after I made a negative comment about the company online? Can't just be a coincidence.
<human> maybe the suspect something and want to talk to you about it. or maybe it's nothing. try not to let it drive you crazy. i know it's easier said than done. <endOfText>

<bot> So upset at my brother for trying to fight me
<human> Brothers always seem to want to get into fights with one another, but at the end of the day, I'm sure you guys love each other very much! <endOfText>
<bot> We were quite furious, he was mad I wouldn't pass him the puck.
<human> Why wouldn't you pass it to'em? Is he a bad shot and you don't want to tell'em? <endOfText>

<bot> When my kids became adults, I gave away all their old toys. Or so I thought... Today I found one of my daughter's old dolls. It brought back so many memories I don't think I can get rid of it.
<human> What made you give them all away? <endOfText>
<bot> Well, I donated them to charity for kids who don't have much.
<human> That is very kind of you, how old is your daughter now? <endOfText>
<bot> What made you give them all away?

<bot> In university, for my major of social work, we all get mandatory internships where they place us in certain ones and we have no control over it. Some other students received cool internship placements, and I feel like mine doesn't compare. Kind of disappointed I didn't get something more interesting
<human> That's unfortunate. At least you can use the experience with your current internship to get you to another place you want to go! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, that's kind of true. We can't change them while in school. They have to place so many people, so they can't really give people the flexibility of choosing where they want to go, or else that would get too complex and hectic. So, I understand that. But still.. some of these places don't match up to some others. I'll be twiddling my thumbs and not learning much, while others will get a good experience. I guess I just have to make the most of it.
<human> That's a great attitude. You will be fine, and can use this as a learning experience <endOfText>

<human> Did you go buy a thousand dollar rig and show em who's boss? <endOfText>
<bot> No I just watched from the distance and reminisced.
<human> You could have reminisced with an airsoft sniper from a safe distance. <endOfText>

<bot> My roommate promised he'd be good with cleaning up after his cat when he asked if he could get one. Now he's hardly ever cleaning the litter box. It's getting old really fast.
<human> Uh oh.  I've heard that plenty of times only to see very similar results.  Time for the cat to move out I think. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah.. no kidding. But I'm not a confrontational person.. I don't want to be bossy. But it's like, you knew what you were getting into. If you didn't want to deal with cat poop, why get the cat? He's 25. He should be mature enough to know these things and deal with them. It's annoying to deal with this mess.
<human> Maybe you can keep the cat and have him move out. <endOfText>
<bot> Uh oh.  I've heard that plenty of times only to see very similar results.  Time for the cat to move out I think.

<human> You sound like a good friend, going through the effort and trouble to fix that up. I'm not into surprises, but I'm sure you know your friend well enough to know that he'd like it if you gave him one. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah I just wanted to show him that we are thinking of him and that he is a very special person.
<human> It's going to be really easy to see that he is special to you guys after tonight. I wish I had a friend like you, even though I don't like surprises. You should be proud of yourself. I hope it goes smoothly! <endOfText>

<human> That's great, I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job, you.  <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks! You should! Better now than tomorrow is my motto!

<bot> Well, I hope you did the right thing and correct their mistake.
<human> Absolutely.  I had to wait until the next day, but I went back to the store and made the matter right.  It is important to me to be honest and trustworthy.  On top of that, I am trying to teach my children the same.  My son was with me, both when I made the purchase, and when I made the purchase right.  This is very important to me. <endOfText>
<bot> My dog had to go to the vet and it took all day. We even had an appointment.
<human> Oh, that's the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, I agree!
<human> We move our lives and schedules around to take care of our pets...the least the can do is do their work well. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh, that's the biggest pain.  I feel like when you pay good money for care for your pet...they should at least be on time.

<bot> I let my brother take care of my dog when I went on vacation. He is the only person who I would let take care of my dog.
<human> Did he do a good job? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes he did. I think my trust paid off because my dog came back healthy and happy.
<human> Thank god, bet you're pleased about that aren't you? <endOfText>
<bot> Did he do a good job?
<human> Yes he did. I think my trust paid off because my dog came back healthy and happy. <endOfText>

<human> Oh my, are you physically okay? It must have been very traumatic for you. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm fine, but emotionally I'm a wreck. Not only am I out the money for the bike, but now I owe my neighbor money to fix his car.

<human> Oh no, that's no good. Did she find out? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes and I feel so ashamed right now. I can't even look her in the eyes anymore because of shame.
<human> Just have a talk with her and apologize. I'm sure she'll understand. Addiction is a life long battle. It's never too late to jump back on the wagon. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, that's no good. Did she find out?
<human> Yes and I feel so ashamed right now. I can't even look her in the eyes anymore because of shame. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm having heart palpitations all the time and they are very concerning to me.
<human> Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out! <endOfText>
<bot> I got checked out by one that had no idea what it was so I need to find a good cardiologist.
<human> Yeah that's what I would do!  Good luck, friend! <endOfText>
<bot> Uh oh!   You should go see a doctor to get that checked out!

<human> I have had that happen to me many times. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, it was kind of a wake-up call, since I'm of the age to have children. Like, "Well, this is what I have to look forward to." I'm not wild about the idea of having to deal with getting little sleep and having to deal with their bodily fluids. But I know it will make my wife happy.

I'm close to graduating myself, and I can already feel the excitement. I hope no one surprises me with a party though.. too shy of a nerd for that. <endOfText>
<bot> That was nice of him. What idea did you have? As in how to return the favor or something?
<human> Sorry, I meant no idea. I was so happy and shocked. <endOfText>
<bot> My ex girlfriend was flirting with these guys right in front of me. She loves the attention.
<human> That's kind of disgusting. I'm glad she's your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it? <endOfText>
<bot> I played it cool and then broke up with her a few days later.
<human> Oh, that happened WHILE you were still dating? Man.. good call. The nerve of some people, and how immature they can be. I don't get how that wouldn't make someone cringe. <endOfText>
<bot> That's kind of disgusting. I'm glad she's your ex. That says much more about you than her. How did you respond to it?
<human> I played it cool and then broke up with her a few days later. <endOfText>
<bot> Went on the very first job interview after graduating. I was nervous, but I felt like it went fairly well. They said they would contact me soon, but it's been a week. I'm not sure what I should do at this point, but I'm staying positive.
<human> They probably have to interview everyone else but it sounds promising! <endOfText>
<bot> That's true.. I guess I hadn't thought of that. I kind of just framed it as, "Aren't I good enough? Then your search should be over!" But it would be dumb not to explore all options available. But this waiting is rough...
<human> I bet it is! and I am sure you ARE good enough. Plus the way I see it if one door shuts another opens you know? Keep your head up  <endOfText>

<bot> My baby boy just moved out to be on his own this last weekend.
<human> Aw it must so hard to let them move on to their own.  <endOfText>
<bot> It is.  It is the very thing we raise them to do, but it is so hard to let go.  After we got him all moved into his new home, I returned home and opened the family photo album to reflect on all of my 4 children.  I'm proud of them all, but I sure miss the days of their presence in my home.

<bot> I remember when movies actually focused more on the plot and acting rather than the special effects. I miss those times.
<human> I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development.  <endOfText>
<bot> Hopefully it goes back to that, after all the special effect hype dies down!
<human> I hope so, too. Meanwhile, you can just watch old movies. <endOfText>
<bot> I completely agree. It used to be about the story line and the character development.

<bot> So yea, last night my brain decided to replay a moment from high school when I forgot my lines in the live drama.
<human> Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened? <endOfText>
<bot> It was! I just completely blanked and started stuttering and mumbling. Eventually another actor came to the rescue and queued me back in.

<bot> Oh gosh! That must have been embarrassing. What happened?
<human> It was! I just completely blanked and started stuttering and mumbling. Eventually another actor came to the rescue and queued me back in. <endOfText>
<bot> One day after work, I was sitting at a table with one of my coworkers and my boss. I was 14 at the time and we worked in a bakery. I said something about brown cows and chocolate milk. That was when i realized that chocolate milk didnt come from brown cows.

<human> hahahaha that's so funny.  Did you get it out of the house? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, my brother helped me. Made up some contraption with a fishing net and tying some wire around the netting, so when you pulled on the wire, it snapped the netting opening shut. Then we transferred it into a trash bag and let it loose. That thing was so spooky man. Cats... bleh.

<bot> I spent this entire summer thinking I was going to lose weight, that I was going to be good on my diet and workout. I did neither. I stayed inside, played video games, ate horribly, and got grumpy ate everybody who reminded me of my promise. Now winter is coming and it's going to be even harder to motivate myself.
<human> Oh no, I'm sorry that sounds awful disappointing. If it's any consolation I think it's easier to diet than to work out. THe old phrase "can't outrun the fork." <endOfText>
<bot> I had never heard that phrase before, but I like it. Yeah, I'm throwing myself a big pity party right now. It's all my own fault though, no one else to blame. My wife tries to cook healthy meals, and encourages me. I just have to not let stress get me to overeat. We'll see how the winter goes.

<bot> I crashed my dirtbike so he drove me home but i was scared of him.
<human> Wow were you ok? Lucky you didn't have to go to the hospital! <endOfText>
<bot> That is a very nice thing for him to do. Where did he pick you up?
<human> I crashed my dirtbike so he drove me home but i was scared of him. <endOfText>
<bot> I just gave my best friend a key to my house. I have known him my whole life and I feel safe with him having access to my home.
<human> Why did you give him access to your home though? <endOfText>
<bot> He is a good friend so I wanted him to be able to come by when I am not there and check on things. Also if he wants to hang out for a while.
<human> That makes sense, you guys going to hangout soon? <endOfText>
<bot> Why did you give him access to your home though?
<human> He is a good friend so I wanted him to be able to come by when I am not there and check on things. Also if he wants to hang out for a while. <endOfText>
<bot> I hesitated before getting on the rollercoaster because it looked so scary!
<human> im terrified of rollercoasters <endOfText>

<bot> Nice! I would love to go on trips except that my boss wouldn't like it if I did!
<human> lol, too funny!  <endOfText>
<bot> I recently came across my old high school year book.
<human> Did it help you rewind the old times?  <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, definitely. Was a great trip down memory lane.
<human> I agree, thats why I always keep my old year books around when I feel like I need a break from the present. <endOfText>
<bot> Did it help you rewind the old times?
<human> Yes, definitely. Was a great trip down memory lane. <endOfText>
<bot> I already booked my flight for vacation before requesting a leave from work!
<human> Oh no! That's exciting and terrifying. Do you think it will work out? <endOfText>
<bot> I sure hope so! I am quite hopeful that I will get my holiday approved since I have worked overtime for 3 months!
<human> In that case I'd say you very well deserve it! I hope you get it. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no! That's exciting and terrifying. Do you think it will work out?
<human> I sure hope so! I am quite hopeful that I will get my holiday approved since I have worked overtime for 3 months! <endOfText>
<bot> I remember when people used to be more courteous.
<human> How so? <endOfText>
<bot> When strangers would say hello and good morning.  Those were the good old days.
<human> Ah yea now everyone is stuck staring at there phones. <endOfText>
<bot> How so?
<human> When strangers would say hello and good morning.  Those were the good old days. <endOfText>
<bot> I have a flight coming up and i absolutely hate flying.
<human> Yeah, flying is the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> I think im going to take some sleeping pills and attempt to sleep.
<human> You can also have some drinks too! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, flying is the worst.
<human> I think im going to take some sleeping pills and attempt to sleep. <endOfText>
<bot> I accidentally didn't confess all my sins oops.
<human> Oh you left some out then? Were they worse ones? <endOfText>
<bot> I sometimes disobey my parents.
<human> Ah I am also guilty of that one. I believe we all are in some ways. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh you left some out then? Were they worse ones?
<human> I sometimes disobey my parents. <endOfText>
<bot> I'm a bit let down by my workplace recently
<human> How come, what are you doing wrong at work? <endOfText>
<bot> Well we had vacation we were promised, and I planned for, but then due to an emergency it all was cancelled.
<human> I'm sorry to hear that, you must be so let down. <endOfText>
<bot> How come, what are you doing wrong at work?

<human> Yeah I'm pretty sure I got this!! <endOfText>
<bot> It is great to be confident. I am sure you will knock the interview out of the park!
<human> Heck yeah!  Wish me luck! <endOfText>
<bot> There is nothing I can complain about. I have a nice house, a great family and a decent job. Life is good.
<human> Hey that's awesome!  Any plans this weekend? <endOfText>
<bot> Not at the moment. I do count my blessings every day. I realize how fortunate everything has gone well for me.
<human> Yeah that's good that you're keeping a level head about it.  And realize that anything can happen at a moments notice.  I tend to appreciate what I have in my life as well. <endOfText>
<bot> Hey that's awesome!  Any plans this weekend?

<bot> Last month I found out my son decided to drop out of college without telling me.
<human> Oh no that sounds terrible. Hopefully it's not as bad as some of those stories I have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree. <endOfText>
<bot> Its worse. He decided to use my tuition money to pay for his drug addiction. I am so disappointed in him.
<human> Oh my gosh that sounds so awful. I'm sorry. Maybe you can try getting him into rehab, I hear it's hard for someone to stop once they start. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no that sounds terrible. Hopefully it's not as bad as some of those stories I have read about where they go so far that they fake having the degree.

<bot> My mom has taken on my brother's two children in the interim while he deals with social services, for getting in trouble with the law. She's in her 60s, and she's handling a 2-year-old and 7-year-old, while working full time. I'm proud of her.
<human> Your mom must be a strong woman. <endOfText>
<bot> I love her. She has so much patience to deal with it all, and she does it all with kindness, and tries to be as loving as possible to the children. But I wish she were harder on my brother. Sometimes I feel like she enables him, by how much she helps him, and prevents reality from slapping my brother in the face. Either way, she's a great woman.
<human> That sounds so troubling.  You should get on your brother's case. <endOfText>
<bot> Your mom must be a strong woman.

<bot> I accidentally bounced a check today.
<human> What a bummer. Did you have any sort of coverage for it? And how did you do it accidentally? <endOfText>
<bot> No, I thought my deposit had cleared but it won't for a couple more days.  I am so upset I did that.
<human> Hopefully you can get through the rough patch in the interim.  <endOfText>
<bot> What a bummer. Did you have any sort of coverage for it? And how did you do it accidentally?
<human> No, I thought my deposit had cleared but it won't for a couple more days.  I am so upset I did that. <endOfText>
<bot> I work as a self-employed transcriptionist. I told my client I'd have work done this week, but my university classes also started this week... and things kind of got away from me, and they won't be done. I'm worried he's going to just tell me he'll have someone else do them, and I'll lose his business.
<human> Yeah well you only have so much time to work with. Time management is one of the most important skills you can learn. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, definitely. And it's one of my worst skills. I don't really have an excuse. I have to get better at handling stress.
<human> The most important thing is to realize you need improvement. Some people like to blame everything else but themself! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah well you only have so much time to work with. Time management is one of the most important skills you can learn.
<human> Yeah, definitely. And it's one of my worst skills. I don't really have an excuse. I have to get better at handling stress. <endOfText>
<bot> It was so awkward when I realized I had worn my wife's dress to work the other day. My first clue something was wrong was when I felt I was wrapped like a stuffed sausage.
<human> Maybe you unconsciously wanted to wear it. Maybe you have some hidden desires your subconscious wanted to explore for you? What if you went and did it again the next day, to see if you liked it? <endOfText>
<bot> That thought crossed my mind but my wife didn't want me ripping her clothes. Luckily I had another suit in the office I changed into.
<human> It's time to go online and buy some summer dresses for yourself. Explore your femininity, man. It's 2018. Anything goes. Bruce/Caitlyn Jenner, etc. Summer isn't over. Put those hairy legs on display and strut your stuff in those dresses. Get flowery ones, too! <endOfText>

<human> Whoop Whoop! That's awesome! I hope you get the job. <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you, I appreciate it!
<human> No problem! Is this a career like job? <endOfText>

<bot> I'm back in my old college town for the first time since graduating. It's weird how many memories flood back from just physically being in a space. I'm seeing all the places I used to eat, my old apartment, my campus, and my friends here and there... makes me wish I could go back
<human> Yeah, it's weird going back to college. <endOfText>
<bot> Definitely. And also seeing the people. Some grow up, some don't. Some want to be the same kind of person that they were in college, and drag you down with them when you see them again. Have to make sure I avoid those.
<human> Oh yeah, bad influences.  When I look at my student loan payments, I don't miss college. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, it's weird going back to college.

<bot> Oh yeah, bad influences.  When I look at my student loan payments, I don't miss college.
<human> Yeah... right there with you... $43,000 and interest. Woo. <endOfText>
<bot> I saw a grown woman pick her nose and eat it earlier.
<human> Okay, so I never understood why people ate it. What is it about it that makes them want to do that? I just flicked mine. And I thought it stopped at a child's age. Really interesting. <endOfText>
<bot> I was so grossed out by it.  I think it has to be a oral fixation or something like that.
<human> I've heard of oral fixations before, but only in the context of like chewing fingernails and smoking cigarettes, etc. But I guess if I think about it, a lot of people chew fingernails, and I'm sure that's just as bad bacteria-wise. Maybe the booger eaters are on to something. <endOfText>

<human> Maybe it helps build their immune system. <endOfText>
<bot> I was traveling last month and the airplane smelled like it hadn't been cleaned for months.
<human> That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell? <endOfText>
<bot> I did because I was disgusted by it! Safe to say, I am never flying American Airlines again!
<human> Good, I would avoid that airline too. <endOfText>
<bot> That must have been unbearable. Did you complain to the staff about the smell?
<human> I did because I was disgusted by it! Safe to say, I am never flying American Airlines again!  <endOfText>
<bot> I kept thinking I had left the front door unlocked whilst I was on vacation!
<human> That is a terrible feeling. I saw a movie where a family actually left their kid at home. That would be the worst. <endOfText>
<bot> Sounds like Home Alone! Yes I was so anxious the entire time that I could not even enjoy myself.
<human> Well I hope everything turned out ok. Maybe you can send a friend to check your door. <endOfText>

<bot> I am so looking forward to the next Avatar sequel. It seems like I have been waiting forever. I am growing impatient.
<human> Avatar the Airbender or James Cameroons Avatar? <endOfText>
<bot> James Cameron's Avatar. I love sci fi and cant wait to see what happens to the Na'vi next.
<human> Ah yes it has been a long time since that movie came out! It has some of the best CGI ever. <endOfText>

<bot> I am upset the Eagles lost yesterday, they lost to the worst team in the league, and got shutout
<human> They just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened. <endOfText>
<bot> I guess not, but they will put it together soon
<human> I hope so, they shouldnt be getting beat like that.  <endOfText>
<bot> They just didnt play like a team and its no surprise that happened.
<human> I guess not, but they will put it together soon <endOfText>
<bot> I woke up and saw someone staring at me in the middle of the night!
<human> Who was it? <endOfText>
<bot> It was just come creep from next door! It was still very terrifying and I had to tell him to leave or I would call the police.
<human> Uh I would have called the police, did they have a reaon? <endOfText>
<bot> Who was it?
<human> It was just come creep from next door! It was still very terrifying and I had to tell him to leave or I would call the police. <endOfText>
<bot> I was.. at home alone.. doing some self-pleasuring, if you will... and my roommate almost walked in on me. I managed to jump into my closet while pulling up my pants before he could see me. So happy I didn't have to have that awkward conversation
<human> Haha good timing by your roommate. Does he not knock? <endOfText>
<bot> He did.. and I said, "Hold up," but I guess he heard something else? I mean... c'mon man. It's annoying. I wish my door had a lock, but it's some old 1950s apartment complex and everything is old. I guess people from the 50s didn't need to lock their doors. Lucky them. But I guess they had lamer porn back then, too.
<human> Hahahaa that's funny. I am sure you can install a lick pretty easily if the door is wooden. <endOfText>

<bot> I love going back and playing Pokemon Emerald, that game was a massive part of my childhood
<human> I bet it brings back lots of great memories. <endOfText>
<bot> It sure does, I played that game for 600+ hours
<human> I do nit think I have heard of that game. Was it pretty popular? <endOfText>

<bot> My husband is training a new female employee at work.
<human> How does that make you feel? <endOfText>
<bot> I do not like it at all. He takes her to lunch everyday and I think it is wrong.
<human> I am sorry, I am sure he is just being nice for the sake of not getting in trouble! <endOfText>
<bot> How does that make you feel?
<human> I do not like it at all. He takes her to lunch everyday and I think it is wrong. <endOfText>
<bot> I have to go to a doctor's appointment on Monday.
<human> That is always a drag. I hope it is routine and nothing serious. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, it's just a checkup but hospitals make me so nervous.
<human> Oh yeah I know what you mean about hospitals. They are always so busy and you see lots of sick people. <endOfText>
<bot> That is always a drag. I hope it is routine and nothing serious.
<human> Yeah, it's just a checkup but hospitals make me so nervous. <endOfText>
<bot> My best friend got such a pretty girlfriend. I don't know how he does it. I look better than him but he gets the pretty girls.
<human> I totally know what you mean. <endOfText>
<bot> I wish I had the game he has. I think I need to cut my hair like him to get a better chance with the ladies.
<human> You also need some good pickup lines. <endOfText>

<bot> I don't know if you have experience with small children, but when my daughter was 3 years old, she spoke her mind all the time.
<human> Did she ever embarass you out in public? <endOfText>
<bot> Numerous times!  The most memorable was when we were checking out at the grocery store.  The cashier was a man that had an earring.  She promptly (and very clearly and loud) told him "Boys don't wear earrings and you need a haircut"
<human> Yikes, I hope they did not take that to heart too much... <endOfText>

<bot> I saw this amazing dog on the television the other day.
<human> Wow! What was the dog doing or what was the show about? <endOfText>

<bot> I found a little girl that was lost wandering around the mall. I took her to one of the stores so they could call security. Her mother finally found her.
<human> That is crazy, how did they get separated? <endOfText>
<bot> No idea. Her mom was very appreciative I made sure that they were reunited. She gave me her number and I got a date with her tomorrow night!
<human> Oh wow, best of luck with that! <endOfText>

<human> Holy cow, congratualtions, that sure is smart of you! <endOfText>

<bot> My mom is starting to develop dementia early. I feel like I'm losing such an important figure in my life much earlier than I should, even though she's still alive. Like, she struggles so much with daily activities and remembering who I am
<human> I am so sorry. I just recently lost my mother after years of her having alzheimer's. I wish there was some way I could help you, it is such a tough road. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I'm not looking forward to going down it. I'll just try to carve out as much meaningful time with her as I can. I feel selfish sometimes though because there are times when I don't want to be around her because it depresses me how she's changed. I need to get over it.
<human> You are completely fine needing some time. There is nothing fair about something that takes your best friend and turns them into a stranger. Be there with her, but you have to take time to recharge yourself. No one can be strong all the time. <endOfText>

<bot> Hey thanks!  I've never flown before.  We're driving down to Florida in a couple weeks.  Should be about a 9 hour drive!
<human> Oh, gotcha. My mix-up. Driving and road trips can still be just as fun. Kinda stinks if you're the only one driving, but at least you can come up with games to play. Plus.. it's cheaper. that's always nice. <endOfText>

<bot> Spent the entire summer with my long distance girlfriend, and now I'm back at home for university. Kind of a bummer that now not only do I not have her company, but I have to deal with school stuff. From one extreme to the other.
<human> Oh man I bet summer went by quick for you then.  Did you have fun together? <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, we went to Estes Park, in Colorado, and hiked at the base of the Rocky Mountains. First time I ever saw mountains. Pretty cool experience. I had to drive the whole way to Colorado though, so I can relate to the road trip thing.

<human> A new job. <endOfText>

<human> I hope so! I hate this feeling. <endOfText>
<bot> I am jealous of my coworker, he is very smart and athletic
<human> Some people have better cards then we do in life. It's how you play your cards though. <endOfText>
<bot> That is true, but I still catch myself wishing I was better
<human> Humans can't help that. But its what makes us strive to be better! <endOfText>

<human> Yeah, the Foles injury is more worrying. <endOfText>
<bot> He should be recovered by the early part of the season.
<human> I think so, but you just never know, and other players are injured as well to worry about <endOfText>
<bot> I am scared of how work is going to go, it is the start of our busiest period of the year
<human> It's hard for me to empathize since I'm just in college right now. But my girlfriend is in a line of work that is the same way, and I hate to see her get so stressed out and all of her time eaten away because of work. I try to give her her space and to be understanding. Hopefully people do that with you, too. <endOfText>
<bot> Sometimes they do, it is tought though, it is way busier than it has been the past few months
<human> Well, if there's any way you can give them insight to what you're dealing with, so that they better understand, I would do it. My girlfriend spent 10 mins one day explaining to me what she dealt with, and it went a long way for me to not bother her as much about it <endOfText>

<bot> My classmates at university are so gossip-y. They get so catty with one another, and spread rumors behind each other's backs. We're in a small major, so everyone knows everyone in this group of 50 students, and a lot of them dislike each other for no good reason
<human> I get that, I have had jobs like that, some people just thrive on drama, they do not enjoy anything more than that <endOfText>
<bot> It seems like it, right? The things they chirp and fight about seem so pointless. Must be because they're bored, I dunno. I just stay out of it.
<human> I understand that, that is a great move by you, do not get sucked in <endOfText>

<bot> I won a small contest. So, my friend was there when I entered the contest, and he was the one that encouraged me to enter. Now that I won, he says he deserves some of the winnings because he was the one that made me enter. I disagree. But he keeps bothering me about it.
<human> Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I don't think that will fly. I won a prize and he wants to split the prize. He knows the odds are small. So since I won, he wants to forget about trying to do it himself, and just wants what I got.
<human> He doesn't sound too reasonable if you ask me. <endOfText>
<bot> Eh give him a dollar and tell him to enter the contest himself.

<bot> I lsot my job the other day and am pretty lost myself.
<human> I hate sayings, but the one that goes, "Tough times don't last, but tough people do," really applies. Life is long. You have plenty of time to change your fortune, and you seem self aware enough to do it. I hope you can work your way back up. <endOfText>
<bot> Wow thank you for the kind words. I will do my best :0
<human> Of course, but it doesn't really matter what I say, or what I think. You already knew all that stuff anyway. Everyone has to have confidence in themselves. Someone else's confidence makes no difference. But as long as you're alive, you've got a chance. <endOfText>

<bot> Exactly what I was thinking since he didnt have his card, but also was wearing jeans and a bookbag! Nothing that one would wear or bring to a pool.

<bot> Thats sounds cool. Im more of an independent traveler. I try to avoid guides.
<human> Im the same, but I think in a place like the grand canyon, it's really dangerous to try to go down there alone. <endOfText>

<bot> My sisters are all adults, I am the middle child.
<human> That doesn't sound fair at all, I wonder why she did that. <endOfText>
<bot> I paid my bill and I felt so bad.
<human> If I were you, I would ask your mom why she paid for your sisters; items and not yours. That's so mean. <endOfText>
<bot> It is very mean. I have a good job so maybe they think I am better off financially.
<human> Now that I think of it, it most likely is the reason why; maybe she doesn't even think of it as a mean act and maybe means no harm by it. Regardless it is important to share how you're feeling with her. <endOfText>

<human> Yes, I was very skeptical. He didn't appear trustworthy at all. <endOfText>

<bot> I was in Walmart and my son pulled a few items off the shelf. Everyone was looking and whispering.
<human> Kids like touching and looking at things, I'm sure no real harm was done. People like making a big deal out of everything. <endOfText>
<bot> And it was mostly the older folks, I tried to put the things back on the shelf.
<human> I'd say ignore them as best as you can. It's normal for kids to do these kind of things! <endOfText>

<human> Did you stop playing after that or did you try to win more? <endOfText>
<bot> I stopped playing, I was afraid of losing it all.
<human> I understand.  I play every now and again and I usually quit while I'm ahead.  It always ends up that I'm waiting on my friends to lose all their money so we can go home! <endOfText>
<bot> That would be sad to win a lot of money, then lose it all.
<human> Yeah - the first time I went with friends, I won 100 bucks but ended up giving it back to the casino.  I told myself that if I won money like that again, I'd just stop and take the money home.  It works out well! <endOfText>

<human> Pro's and Con's.  Those systems are abuse prone but, some people need them. <endOfText>

<bot> Yesterday was my sister's birthday and I totally forgot to call her until today
<human> Was she upset! <endOfText>
<bot> She said it was ok, but I still feel bad about it.  I guess I will have to compensate her with a great present.

<human> Oh my gosh. I am not surprised they denied any wrong doing. I think that is typical of mechanics. What do you plan to do about it? <endOfText>
<bot> I guess I can't do anything but write a bad review.
<human> I think bad reviews are important though. A lot of people use those to determine where they go for service. You may save someone else the trouble you have. <endOfText>

<human> I could not agree more with you. but it seems like a lot of politicians either don't care or are not putting enough resources into combating climate change. <endOfText>
<bot> I still hope they will be enlightened soon,  I will be praying for that.

<bot> Not really, they are young, but they were trying to get a sibling in trouble instead of themselves.  I wasn't expecting it at such a young age...only 3.
<human> I think they would lie sooner if they could.  My kid told me flat out that her brother did something when it was impossible that he could've so I knew instantly.  Its humorous while they're young watching them get into such a deep hole. <endOfText>

<bot> That is a great idea
<human> Glad I could help. <endOfText>

<bot> My dog of 10 years recently passed away.
<human> I truly do feel bad that you have to endure that. My girlfriend and I were just talking about how horrible she's going to feel when she loses her Havanese pup at some point in the distant future, since she's so close to her. I hope you can grieve the loss of your great friend in a healthy way. <endOfText>
<bot> Thank you very much. Yes, it's always really hard to lose a pet you are so close to. My finacee is urging me to get another puppy to help the feeling pass.
<human> I can appreciate why they'd say that. They just want you to feel better. But it's all about to how you're feeling. You'll know in your gut when to get another pet, if you ever want to get another one. It's important to take the time to reflect on your lost relationship. <endOfText>

<bot> Spent a lot of my saturday organizing and cleaning my room. There's no better feeling that knowing you accomplished an errand you were supposed to do, and getting to enjoy clean space after your hard work.
<human> That's wonderful! You're right, it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, it's kind of a shame my roommate isn't the cleanest. So, when I bother to clean the other areas of the apartment, it kind of goes to waste. But at least I can kind of keep up my own little domain and use it as a retreat from the rest of the place.
<human> Right, that's something you can at least have full control over. Your own humble abode. <endOfText>
<bot> That's wonderful! You're right, it is so rewarding to stand back and see everything clean once you are done.

<bot> I was mad last week when my landlord was taking their time fixing my ac. It was so hot
<human> Was your landlord truly trying their best, or did they simply not care about your well-being at that time? <endOfText>
<bot> I do not think they cared
<human> I'm so sorry to hear that. Some people are just cruel to others that are not within their social circle. <endOfText>
<bot> Was your landlord truly trying their best, or did they simply not care about your well-being at that time?
<human> I do not think they cared <endOfText>
<bot> My roommate always pees all over the toilet seat.
<human> ugh. People like that are gross. <endOfText>

<bot> I love having my kitty snuggling up to me.  I feel so loved!
<human> Funny you say that... my roommate just got a cat about a month ago. I was hesitant to agree to share the apartment with it, as I'm not the most fond of them. But I didn't want to say no. It's actually been an affectionate cat so far. <endOfText>
<bot> Cats will make you love animals!   They can be so affectionate.
<human> I suppose so. I've never gravitated towards them. They seem like they only have one personality, and they're either nice or mean, and never warm up to you over time. So, I was a little wary of that. <endOfText>

<human> What kind of hobby do you have? <endOfText>
<bot> So, I make boats. It's a little time consuming, but I've loved woodworking, and my dad was a sailor, so I've been around boats all my life. I decided to combine the two.

<human> Yeah, when I was younger I did some of that stuff as well. It's a really embarrassing thing to hear stories about things you did that you don't remember doing. <endOfText>
<bot> Tell me about it, nothing like having someone tell you that you strpped down and jumped into the pool while everyone was still there. Glad those days are behind me
<human> Well if you have never gotten blind drunk and strip naked, you haven't lived. <endOfText>

<bot> I got approved for a scholarship for college that I had been competing for for many months!
<human> Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I haven't been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead. <endOfText>
<bot> I agree, I wanted to attend a higher ranking school but they didn't give me any scholarship so I decided not to accept their offer.
<human> Sometimes compromises have to be made. But I have to say, I'm impressed that you were that self-aware about the entire process, especially as a somewhat new adult. Good for you for considering all the options and making the choice you felt was best. You sound like you'll be successful after college, especially because of how hard-working you are. <endOfText>
<bot> Nice! I wish I was more active in searching for scholarships like it sounds like you are. But this one sounds like it was a lot of hard work to earn. I haven't been the smartest about lightening the student loan debt burden while in school. Good on you for looking ahead.
<human> I agree, I wanted to attend a higher ranking school but they didn't give me any scholarship so I decided not to accept their offer.  <endOfText>
<bot> I hate parents that censor every TV show, movie, video game, or song on the radio. Of course it's one thing to let a 5-year-old watch "Silence of the Lambs"; but do you really expect to raise the next Einstein by blinding him to the real world? By the time he's 13 he or she's gonna have some serious repression issues and grow up to be a weirdo
<human> I agree, such helicopter parents exercise far too much control on their kids, doing more harm than good in the long run. <endOfText>
<bot> Yes I'm glad you see it that way.  Which is why I think despite all the shortcomings Millenials have we're probably going to be the best generation of parents in history lol
<human> I completely agree. Unfortunately we also have to clean up the mess made by our parent generation.. you know like climate change exists!  <endOfText>

<bot> My brother won a championship in karate. I am so happy for him!
<human> What kind of belt does he have? <endOfText>
<bot> he is already black.
<human> Heh. Thats really cool. I need to take self defense classes. <endOfText>
<bot> What kind of belt does he have?
<human> he is already black. <endOfText>
<bot> I ate my husbands leftovers while he was asleep
<human> Did you tell him he ate it in his sleep <endOfText>
<bot> Nope he hasnt checked yet
<human> I hope it tasted good! <endOfText>

<bot> I am nervous about monday. I have to go to the doctor again
<human> Why are you having to go again? <endOfText>
<bot> I am still coughing a lot
<human> Probably from the crazy weather change. I hope they figure out what is causing the cough <endOfText>
<bot> Why are you having to go again?
<human> I am still coughing a lot <endOfText>
<bot> My son started getting into a little bit of trouble and got kicked out of summer school on the first day, so he decided to sign up for a youth chalenge program
<human> Oh no. Well I hope that makes him better <endOfText>
<bot> He has been there for 5 weeks, I got to see him for the first time last Saturday. With him being gone I find myself anxious with him not being able to call home or come home
<human> I am sure he will be fine <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no. Well I hope that makes him better

<bot> I've recently been on a weight loss program.  I've done very well.  I've lost 30 lbs!
<human> I am happy for you. Just keep going <endOfText>
<bot> Yes, but because of this, my pants have been loose.  The other day, my hands were full carrying boxes.  My pants fell down to my ankles while I was walking!!!
<human> That is a good thing ha <endOfText>
<bot> I am happy for you. Just keep going
<human> Yes, but because of this, my pants have been loose.  The other day, my hands were full carrying boxes.  My pants fell down to my ankles while I was walking!!! <endOfText>
<bot> I am really happy with my tattoo artist. He is not charging me a lot for great work
<human> That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much.  <endOfText>
<bot> They can be very expensive
<human> It seems that a decent one is several hundred dollars.  I just don't have that kind of money. <endOfText>
<bot> That's great.  I don't have any tattoos myself, but a lot of people I know do.  And it seems expensive.  So I'm glad he's not charging you much.

<bot> My mom said she'd go to the doctor the next time she started feeling weird heart palpitations again. I'm about a thousand miles away from her, so I can't force her to go. But I'm worried about her, as she's always avoided the doctor, and always been in poor health. Hope she does the right thing
<human> I hope so, too. Heart conditions can be scary! Do you have anyone closer to her that could check in? <endOfText>
<bot> Sort of.. we have a neighbor that's been by her for 10 years, and they've been friends for a long time. But she's older herself, and has her own worries, so it's not like I can put more on her plate. My mother is just stubborn. I love her to death, but she's kind of a "What will be, will be" type person, and just assumes life will happen and you can, nor should, do anything to get in the way of it.
<human> I know quite a few people that live their lives that way. I can see some of the reasons why a person would think that -- but it's still difficult when it comes to the health of someone you love. <endOfText>

<bot> I've gotten some bad publicity in the past.
<human> What is deserved or undeserved?  <endOfText>
<bot> Undeserved, buy I'm the only one that thought so.
<human> I see, dont worry though. Nowadays everyone finds an excuse to grab their pitchfork and point it at someone.    <endOfText>

<human> Undeserved, buy I'm the only one that thought so. <endOfText>
<bot> My car engine start smoking but my mechanic arrived and fixed my car within an hour!
<human> That's good timing at least. Glad it didn't take too long. <endOfText>
<bot> I agree I was thoroughly impressed by his expertise. I was glad to be back on the road so quickly.
<human> What ended up being the problem ? <endOfText>
<bot> That's good timing at least. Glad it didn't take too long.

<bot> I've been long distance with my girlfriend for about 6 years, mainly because I've been in university for a while. But I graduate this spring, and I'm going to propose to her after the ceremony. She's been patient this entire time, and hopefully it will all pay off.
<human> She sounds like a great girl. I am sure it will you sound like a happy couple. <endOfText>
<bot> I hope so. I owe a lot to her. She motivated me to get off of my behind and make something of myself and go to school. Before her, I was just an unproductive man-child, playing games at my parent's house. Now I've moved out, work part-time while going to school.. It's time to pay her back.
<human> Hell yea you sound like a genuine guy/girl. You know what is important, you will do fine. <endOfText>

<bot> I was going through my attic and found some of my old childhood toys
<human> You must be feeling nostalgic, maybe your kids will enjoy them <endOfText>

<bot> I clogged the toilet at work yesterday. I had to take a huge dump and there was nothing to do about it. The toilet couldn't handle it. I couldn't fix it, either. So, I just quietly whisked away. I feel bad for the janitor that has to deal with it
<human> yeah but that is his ob <endOfText>
<bot> That's true. But I wish there was something I could have done to make it easier on him. I've always had random small talk with him, and he's the nicest person. I just feel like a gross slob.
<human> yeah im not sure i could every take that job <endOfText>
<bot> yeah but that is his ob

<bot> i was at a rangers game and this guy attacked a kid over the shirt he was wearing
<human> That sounds like an uncomfortable situation. What ended up happening? I kind of avoid large crowds and sports events because of this, since there's usually alcohol involved. <endOfText>
<bot> yeah it just made me upset so i had a argument with him
<human> Oh, so you got involved? Were you trying to protect the kid? If so, I can understand that, and that's noble. Hopefully nothing too negative came from the situation. <endOfText>

<bot> When my husband and I first got together he use to talk to his ex girlfriend all the time cause she was with one of his friends. I despised that woman
<human> Yikes, that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that. <endOfText>
<bot> I did, he said she did not mean anything to him and stopped going over to his friends house
<human> That's good, at least he learned from that. I hope you guys are going strong now! <endOfText>
<bot> Yikes, that's very disrespectful. I hope you told him how you feel about that.
<human> I did, he said she did not mean anything to him and stopped going over to his friends house  <endOfText>

<human> Did your boyfriend notice? <endOfText>
<bot> Haha yes, he wondered where it went. I told him the dog ate it.

<human> That sucks, I'm sorry to hear it. Did they at least ask you first? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes but I couldn't go because of work. Guess I will have to suck it up and be lonely for a while.
<human> At least they asked you, that's good. It will pass in no time and you'll be hanging soon I'm sure, <endOfText>
<bot> That sucks, I'm sorry to hear it. Did they at least ask you first?

<bot> I let my guard down around my best friend and she told all my secrets away
<human> Dang, I guess she wasn't your friend after all <endOfText>

<bot> Dang, I guess she wasn't your friend after all

<bot> Not yet, but I think I will soon
<human> Ahh, that's too bad. Just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions, maybe it won't be so bad. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh no, did you get into trouble with your boss?
<human> Not yet, but I think I will soon <endOfText>
<bot> I miss the smell of burnt hay in the fall, my hometown farmers used to do it every year.
<human> I get that, nothing can beat home! <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah, I wish I visited more often, but my job keeps me away.
<human> I am sorry to hear that, well maybe when you retire! <endOfText>
<bot> I get that, nothing can beat home!

<human> Gross!  I would have been super mad if my cat did that!  What did you do? <endOfText>
<bot> I had to clean it up, but not before I yelled at her and showed her what she did.
<human> Yeah, I would have done the some.  Hopefully that never happens to you again. <endOfText>

<bot> My wife has out of town for a couple weeks and we just moved to this city. I feel so bored and have no one to hang out with.
<human> Oh no, maybe try going to reddit and ask people what to do in your city! <endOfText>
<bot> That's actually a really good idea!  I am always on reddit anyways!
<human> Hahaha, me too, it's such a time sink. This week when it was down for a couple hours I really felt like I had nothing else to browse. <endOfText>

<bot> I totaled my brand new car yesterday.
<human> Oh wow, that isn't good.  Hopefully you had good insurance and that you are ok! <endOfText>

<bot> A friend of mine who works for me (really with me) was recently offered another job for a little more pay.  I was quite nervous on what he would decide.  In fact, he never even mentioned it to me.  I found out through an acquaintance that he had been offered the job.
<human> I hope you don't feel jealous of your friend. Did he accept the job? <endOfText>
<bot> It wasn't so much jealousy.  I just depend on him a lot.  What was funny was that I asked him about it, and he told me, "I never mentioned it because I never considered it.  We've got too good a thing going here."  I was amazed at his loyalty.
<human> Seems like you have a trustworthy friend for life! I hope you cherish this friendship. <endOfText>

<bot> A mosquito has been flying around my face all day and its really starting to get to me.
<human> Don't you just hate that?! <endOfText>
<bot> I do! I am beyond annoyed and will try to obliterate it with my hand if I see it again.
<human> Just remember, it is probably a female mosquito.  They are the ones interested in your blood.  Not the males.   <endOfText>
<bot> Don't you just hate that?!
<human> I do! I am beyond annoyed and will try to obliterate it with my hand if I see it again. <endOfText>
<bot> I feel horrible. I let go of all of my friends and don't know how to move forward.
<human> Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends? <endOfText>
<bot> They live a drug culture.
<human> Good job for realizing that because such people are a bad influence. Join some outdoor or interest clubs and you might just find new friends.  <endOfText>
<bot> Sorry to hear that but why did you distance yourself from your friends?
<human> They live a drug culture. <endOfText>
<bot> I was cut off today and crashed my car into a pole to avoid colliding with someone.
<human> Oh no! Are you ok? <endOfText>

<bot> This girl just invited me out on a date. She seems sweet and I'm interested.. more interested in her than I am this other girl I've been seeing for a few weeks. But I feel bad just dropping this girl I've been seeing recently. Like, wouldn't that be rude?
<human> I think if it's done without care then yes, care for what she would feel that is. Maybe you just have to tell the truth about what you're feeling, but it's up to you! <endOfText>
<bot> That's some good advice. I think my main problem is I don't know if it's just a "grass is greener" type situation. I've enjoyed my time with the first girl, but there's not a big "spark." But who knows if there actually has to be one? Guess I'll have to think on it more.
<human> Right, but deep down I'm sure you know that you don't need a relationship to feel content! <endOfText>

<bot> The results came in and I won the national debate championship with my team!
<human> Hey, congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. It's a good look in the future. Especially the debate team--you develop so many good life skills with that! <endOfText>
<bot> I agree, it was a proud moment for us! I had to sacrifice a lot of time and energy to be able to get here.
<human> I bet... that's a lot of weekends and late evenings practicing and honing your skills. I'm sure it's a lot of positive intangibles developed that you will reap the awards from later on in life. <endOfText>
<bot> Hey, congratulations. That must have been a lot of hard work. I wish I put more time into extracurricular stuff like that. It's a good look in the future. Especially the debate team--you develop so many good life skills with that!

<bot> I'm finally able to afford decent health insurance for once in my life. Not only does it feel good to know I'm covered for some unexpected bad stuff, but I can actually go to the dentist and optometrist and keep up with my teeth/eye health for once.
<human> Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing, and the more you look after your body, the better it will treat you.  <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah. I mean I was a home-body and lives a pretty boring life, so I never truly felt in danger of not having health insurance in the past. But it was still a pretty stupid way to live. One accident could have ended it all in terms of financial health.
<human> I agree, now you will financially and physically secure. All the stress of not having insurance is far too much given our healthcare costs. <endOfText>
<bot> Glad to hear it! Health is such an important thing, and the more you look after your body, the better it will treat you.

<bot> I am mad at my brother because he broke my bike. He always want to use my stuff and he ends up breaking it.
<human> Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it? <endOfText>
<bot> He is never going to pay or fix it. I already asked him for something else that he broke. He never did pay or fix it.
<human> Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff, unfortunately. <endOfText>
<bot> Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it?
<human> He is never going to pay or fix it. I already asked him for something else that he broke. He never did pay or fix it. <endOfText>

<human> He didnt want to serve at the DMZ. <endOfText>
<bot> That's a bit much of him to dodge his country when they needed him don't you think?
<human> I dont know. I was just surprised because there is no actual war. He just has to mostly observe. He would have to kill If a North Korean soldier tried to cross. <endOfText>
<bot> I am very happy. My son was top of the class, this year.

<human> he was and yea it was, he completely ruined the night out. <endOfText>
<bot> I often get so annoyed having pictures taken of me, and getting asked to smile. I hate my teeth, since they're so big. I wish I had smaller, more natural teeth that other people do.. it makes me so paranoid sometimes.
<human> Don't be! You are awesome the way you are! <endOfText>
<bot> I appreciate that. And I try to tell myself that imperfections help people stay grounded and kind. But it's still hard not to get so self-conscious about it in everyday life. I almost want to grab something and grind them down!
<human> Our imperfections help us stay unique! Do worry yourself with that, there are so many other things that can get us down and worry us! Just keep being awesome! <endOfText>
<bot> Don't be! You are awesome the way you are!

<bot> My son went into a youth challenge program. I am hoping that this will help him become better person and give him the discipline that he needs.
<human> Ahh, is he a troublemaker right now? Most of the time, it's the friends they hang out with. Young people are easily influenced by the people around them. <endOfText>
<bot> It had alot to do with the crowd he was keeping at school. their habits was rubbing off on him. I tried talking to him several times about it but of course with being the mother he acted like I did not know what I was talking about. He is not just horrible but I knew if something did not change it would have gotten worse
<human> Yes, he needs a firm hand to lead the way out of this kind of behaviours. You need to step up and introduce some strict schedules so he won't have time to do anything bad.  <endOfText>

<bot> We're going to six flags.  I've never ridden a coaster before.
<human> Lol. Oh. Coasters are fun. Very exciting! <endOfText>

<bot> I don't know if its weird but I am most comfortable laying in bed watching TV and hanging out from there.
<human> I'm right there with you. I've always been a home-body. I don't like going out as much. Sometimes people say millennials and technology have disconnected people too much.. that could be true. But at least we're comfortable doin it. <endOfText>
<bot> Yeah for sure, I still like people but not everyday and my fiance is usually enough for me with my animals!
<human> Absolutely. I'm the kind of person that can be around for people a little bit, but get drained by them. I think that's getting more and more common for others. Could you tell me what kind of animals you have real quick! <endOfText>

<human> That is awesome, I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!! <endOfText>
<bot> My daughter was also but I didn't want to put any pressure on him since all kids are so different and it didn't matter.  But he astounded me and loves reading and writing.
<human> I hope they both keep the love for reading and writing! <endOfText>
<bot> That is awesome, I was an early reader as well! That is a great accomplishment!!
<human> My daughter was also but I didn't want to put any pressure on him since all kids are so different and it didn't matter.  But he astounded me and loves reading and writing.   <endOfText>
<bot> I didn't get the big promotion at work.
<human> Oh no! I'm so sorry!  Are you able to be up for another one soon? <endOfText>
<bot> There are promotions that come up quite often within my company, so I am hoping for another chance within the month.

<human> It happens to the best of us! I know the lady understands! <endOfText>
<bot> I hope so, she pretended not to hear but I know she heard it. It was just so embarrassing and left me red faced!
<human> Maybe you'll never see her again!  <endOfText>

<human> I hope so, she pretended not to hear but I know she heard it. It was just so embarrassing and left me red faced!  <endOfText>

<bot> Was walking down the street yesterday and some little twerp ran his skateboard right into me, and he slammed into the back of my knee. It's been throbbing all day and it's swollen. Pretty sure something's messed up. I'm ready for bad news. At least I have insurance now.
<human> Oh wow, I'm sorry to hear that! Put your leg up and relax this weekend!  <endOfText>

<bot> My current employer is having big financials problem. I am afraid that the company will go into bankruptcy.
<human> That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like you're self-aware and anticipating the problem, though. Perhaps you've already started preparing to look elsewhere? <endOfText>
<bot> I started looking. I have been with this company for so long that I forgot how to write a resume and how to look efficiently for a job.
<human> Well, luckily Google is so helpful these days. There's tons of templates out there. It's kind of annoying to deal with, especially because it's being motivated by your company possibly disappearing.. but it won't take long at all to craft a good one, especially because oftentimes the shorter they are, the better <endOfText>
<bot> That sounds really frustrating to deal with. You sound like you're self-aware and anticipating the problem, though. Perhaps you've already started preparing to look elsewhere?
<human> I started looking. I have been with this company for so long that I forgot how to write a resume and how to look efficiently for a job. <endOfText>
<bot> First time in a long time I've gotten a haircut that I'm satisfied with. For once my big head doesn't look so big. I actually don't feel too stupid looking!
<human> Nice. Did you find a good hairdresser? <endOfText>
<bot> Just some barber who found a way to give me what I like without me being able to say it. That's always been my problem, I have problems describing it, and feel dumb trying to find pictures showing it. I just told him to do what he think would look good.. luckily it worked
<human> That is great. <endOfText>

<bot> Sometimes I feel like I have so much going on that I feel overwhelmed and over ran with anxiety that it makes it hard to stay focused on everything
<human> I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop, take a deep breath, and do one thing at a time. <endOfText>
<bot> That makes sense. I am going to start trying that more
<human> It's just a way to calm the body and the mind.  It is SO easy to fall into the trap of anxiety.  But falling there doesn't accomplish a thing.  Take a breath, focus on one small success, then move to the next.   <endOfText>
<bot> I totally understand.  Life can sometimes seem overwhelming.  I have learned to stop, take a deep breath, and do one thing at a time.
<human> That makes sense. I am going to start trying that more <endOfText>
<bot> My friends just recently purchased a brand new, new car smelling, 2019 Honda Civic.
<human> Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol <endOfText>
<bot> Well, for me, I am honestly angry.  I look at their success and feel it should be me!
<human> Sometimes jealousy can become us. But most times it does not pay to be that way, cause 9 times out of 10 those kind of people is just living off credit so technically it is not something they own out right <endOfText>
<bot> Yikes! Bet the car payment is not worth it. lol

<human> You are probably right.  I feel like such a terrible friend for feeling that way.  Nevertheless, it is a little motivation for me to work that much harder.   <endOfText>
<bot> Just had to tell mom I stole some candies,
<human> Woah, hope she doesn't report you! Jk <endOfText>
<bot> I hope so too, but I feel quite guilty regarding it,

<bot> I love so much my wife. She has been so caring and kind with me.
<human> That's really nice! You should show her you appreciate her. Maybe cook her dinner! <endOfText>

<bot> I get so flustered whenever there is a training class at work and I have to get up in front of everyone and walk out.  I dread if I have to use the restroom or get water!
<human> Ugh that must so inconvenient and uncomfortable!  <endOfText>
<bot> It really is, I just have social anxiety really bad I think.

<bot> My friend just won a lottery and got tickets to the Superbowl and I lost!
<human> Oh gosh, is he going to take you to the Superbowl at least? <endOfText>
<bot> I dont think he can since he only won one ticket. I am beyond jealous right now but also happy for him since he really wants to go.
<human> Just one ticket, that sounds lonely for him. <endOfText>

<human> Well it's not a huge deal in the grand scheme of the universe! I am sure it will be fine. <endOfText>
<bot> Oh naughty. Did anyone see you?
<human> no but i still feel bad about it <endOfText>
<bot> I am all packed and ready to go see my family!
<human> Are you making a trip to see your family? <endOfText>
<bot> Yes! We are driving up to see them on Monday.
<human> Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far? <endOfText>

<bot> Great. It is always good to see your family. Is it very far?
<human> It is a 7 hour drive. It takes  a little longer with bathroom breaks though. <endOfText>
<bot> I recently found that I was adopted. I felt terrible bad.
<human> That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out? <endOfText>
<bot> I had an argument with my oncle. He is one that told me. He told me "You are not part of this family!!! You are adopted!!!"
<human> Wow. That is really horrible. I am so sorry that happened to you.  <endOfText>
<bot> That would definitely be a difficult thing to find out. How did you find out?

<bot> I lost my swim bottoms going down the slide at the water park.
<human> Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen, too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once, too! Now that was really scary <endOfText>
<bot> It was horrible, but I recovered! No shame.
<human> That's the spirit. It's good that you don't take yourself too seriously. Heck, my roommate walked in on me doing some "self-pleasure" just yesterday.. I used to think that was my worst nightmare, but in the moment I just did my best to laugh it off so we could move forward faster <endOfText>
<bot> Haha.. I feel like that's almost a rite of passage when going to water parks. I've had that happen, too. Hopefully it wasn't too traumatic for you. I almost lost my glasses once, too! Now that was really scary

<bot> My apartment complex is nickel and diming me and counting off so many things wrong with the apartment to detract from my security deposit as I get set to leave after this month. I know people said to expect to never see your security deposit again, but this is ridiculous! I feel like the apartment is pretty much exactly the same
<human> I hate when that happens! The same thing happened to me when I moved out of my apartment. They kept my security deposit because they needed to replace carpet. <endOfText>
<bot> It's a racket. The building is from the 1950s and has hardly been updated. Of course everything is going to look like crap. They just splash the cheapest white paint everywhere. At least there's no carpet in mine that would need to be replaced. Bleh
<human> Mine hadn't been replaced in 6 years, I found that out after the fact.  <endOfText>

<bot> My boss informed me that I am in the first position of getting the promotion
<human> That's pretty awesome, congrats <endOfText>
<bot> Thanks, my confidence in my abilities is just getting better and better!
<human> Confidence is key, it's honestly what upper management looks for not necessarily technical skills right off the bat...just like Leo DiCaprio in "Catch Me if You Can" haha <endOfText>
<bot> That's pretty awesome, congrats
<human> Thanks, my confidence in my abilities is just getting better and better! <endOfText>
<bot> People can give me all the bullshit advice they want on how to live my life and how I need to know my place in society....but I'll just smile and nod because I only trust my instincts and am have ridiculously more freedom, money and happiness than I've ever had before
<human> Good on you. You need to be comfortable in your own skin and its not other people's business to tell you how to live.  <endOfText>
<bot> Exactly.  Funny thing is they're usually the same people that bitch and moan on Facebook about having a job or boss they hate but do nothing to change their path it's hilarious
<human> Yes, they should really learn to concentrate on their own life instead of complaining about other people. <endOfText>

<bot> I was watching professional rodeo last night. I was amazed at how the cowboyos can stay on the bulls so long.
<human> That is an amazing talent to have. I would be so scared! <endOfText>
