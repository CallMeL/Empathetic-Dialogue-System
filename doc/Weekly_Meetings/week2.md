# Weekly meeting 2
Date: 30.10.2024

## What we discussed
### With the UKE doctor
  * The desired outcome would be: for each sentence, there is a stroke score, and in the end there is a final score with explanation. An interface is also desired.
  * Data will be kept in local.

### With ML teachers
* Can we use pre-trained models, or it is mandatory to train it by ourselves: we need to train a LLM **from scratch**, not pre-trained!
* Can we keep the GitHub repository private, because we want to publish later: Yes

* Important question: is it difficult to covert the text to the table, otherwise it is meaningless to use llm

### Inside the group
* Timeline
* What models should we choose
* More data needed!
