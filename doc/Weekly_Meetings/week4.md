## What we discussed

### inside the group
1. do we need to use the evaluation metrics while training? 
   1. No, we don't need to
2. **How we gonna use the emotion tag?** maybe we can ask the teachers, and also make this as a goal for next week.

## Goals for next week
1. More EDA and Use ChatGPT or other LLMs to generate more data (the format of data: excel)
   1. vocabulary size
   2. similarity of the sentences
2. How we gonna use the emotion tag (research)
3. Run the model with our own data, and visualize the results, search for other available models
