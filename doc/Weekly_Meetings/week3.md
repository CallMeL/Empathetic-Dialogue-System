# Weekly meeting X
Date: 06.11.2024
## What we discussed
We change the topic! As we don't have the data from UKE doesn't meet the requirement for our ML project.

### inside the group
### with the teachers
* don't need to implement from scratch, but the code needed to be changed (if we used existed libraries)
* **About the Sarcasm detection**
  * Since detecting sarcasm is a difficult topic, especially with our small LLM, it likely won't work. They mentioned that there is essentially no reason to add another challenge alongside building this empathic dialogue generation
  * So they suggest that if our model could generate high-quality responses, we could then try to **create diverse responses with different sentiments**.
    * e.g.) Input: It was a very tough day.
      * Response 1 with a "happy, encouraging" emotion: You've done well today, and it's great that you've gotten through it!
      * Response 2 based on a "sad, moody" emotion: Days like this can feel especially heavy. It's important to fully feel your emotions, so take a break here.*
## Goals for next week
* EDA of the dataset
* model tryout
